INTERNAL-COMBUSTION; INTERNAL-COMBUSTION ENGINE
In*ter"nal-com*bus"tion, a. (Mach.)

Defn: Designating, or pertaining to, any engine (called an Internal-
combustion engine) in which the heat or pressure energy necessary to
produce motion is developed in the engine cylinder, as by the
explosion of a gas, and not in a separate chamber, as in a steam-
engine boiler. The gas used may be a fixed gas, or one derived from
alcohol, ether, gasoline (petrol), naphtha, oil (petroleum), etc.
There are three main classes: (1) gas engines proper, using fixed
gases, as coal, blast-furnace, or producer gas; (2) engines using the
vapor of a volatile fluid, as the typical gasoline (petrol) engine;
(3) oil engines, using either an atomized spray or the vapor
(produced by heat) of a comparatively heavy oil, as petroleum or
kerosene. In all of these the gas is mixed with a definite amount of
air, the charge is composed in the cylinder and is then exploded
either by a flame of gas (flame ignition -- now little used), by a
hot tube (tube ignition) or the like, by an electric spark (electric
ignition, the usual method is gasoline engines, or by the heat of
compression, as in the Diesel engine. Gas and oil engines are chiefly
of the stationary type. Gasoline engines are largely used for
automobile vehicles, boats, etc. Most internal-combustion engines use
the Otto (four-stroke) cycle, though many use the two-stroke cycle.
They are almost universally trunk engines and single-acting. Because
of the intense heat produced by the frequent explosions, the
cylinders must be cooled by a water jacket (water-cooled) or by air
currents (air cooled) to give the maximum thermodynamic efficiency
and to avoid excessive friction or seizing.

1. (Chem.)

Defn: The most common and most useful metallic element, being of
almost universal occurrence, usually in the form of an oxide (as
hematite, magnetite, etc.), or a hydrous oxide (as limonite, turgite,
etc.). It is reduced on an enormous scale in three principal forms;
viz., cast iron, steel, and wrought iron. Iron usually appears dark
brown, from oxidation or impurity, but when pure, or an fresh
surface, is a gray or white metal. It is easily oxidized (rusted) by
moisture, and is attacked by many corrosive agents. Symbol Fe (Latin
Ferrum). Atomic weight 55.9. Specific gravity, pure iron, 7.86; cast
iron, 7.1. In magnetic properties, it is superior to all other
substances.

Note: The value of iron is largely due to the facility with which it
can be worked. Thus, when heated it is malleable and ductile, and can
be easily welded and forged at a high temperature. As cast iron, it
is easily fusible; as steel, is very tough, and (when tempered) very
hard and elastic. Chemically, iron is grouped with cobalt and nickel.
Steel is a variety of iron containing more carbon than wrought iron,
but less that cast iron. It is made either from wrought iron, by
roasting in a packing of carbon (cementation) or from cast iron, by
burning off the impurities in a Bessemer converter (then called
Bessemer steel), or directly from the iron ore (as in the Siemens
rotatory and generating furnace).

2. An instrument or utensil made of iron; -- chiefly in composition;
as, a flatiron, a smoothing iron, etc.
My young soldier, put up your iron. Shak.

3. pl.

Defn: Fetters; chains; handcuffs; manacles.
Four of the sufferers were left to rot in irons. Macaulay.

4. Strength; power; firmness; inflexibility; as, to rule with a rod
of iron. Bar iron. See Wrought iron (below).
 -- Bog iron, bog ore; limonite. See Bog ore, under Bog.
 -- Cast iron (Metal.), an impure variety of iron, containing from
three to six percent of carbon, part of which is united with a part
of the iron, as a carbide, and the rest is uncombined, as graphite.
It there is little free carbon, the product is white iron; if much of
the carbon has separated as graphite, it is called gray iron. See
also Cast iron, in the Vocabulary.
 -- Fire irons. See under Fire, n.
 -- Gray irons. See under Fire, n.
 -- Gray iron. See Cast iron (above).
 -- It irons (Naut.), said of a sailing vessel, when, in tacking, she
comes up head to the wind and will not fill away on either tack.
 -- Magnetic iron. See Magnetite.
 -- Malleable iron (Metal.), iron sufficiently pure or soft to be
capable of extension under the hammer; also, specif., a kind of iron
produced by removing a portion of the carbon or other impurities from
cast iron, rendering it less brittle, and to some extent malleable.
 -- Meteoric iron (Chem.), iron forming a large, and often the chief,
ingredient of meteorites. It invariably contains a small amount of
nickel and cobalt. Cf. Meteorite.

 -- White iron. See Cast iron (above).
 -- Wrought iron (Metal.), the purest form of iron commonly known in
the arts, containing only about half of one per cent of carbon. It is
made either directly from the ore, as in the Catalan forge or
bloomery, or by purifying (puddling) cast iron in a reverberatory
furnace or refinery. It is tough, malleable, and ductile. When formed
into bars, it is called bar iron.

1. (R. C. Ch.)

Defn: One of a religious order founded by Ignatius Loyola, and
approved in 1540, under the title of The Society of Jesus.

Note: The order consists of Scholastics, the Professed, the Spiritual
Coadjutors, and the Temporal Coadjutors or Lay Brothers. The Jesuit
novice after two years becomes a Scholastic, and takes his first vows
of poverty, chastity, and obedience simply. Some years after, at the
close of a second novitiate, he takes his second vows and is ranked
among the Coadjutors or Professed. The Professed are bound by a
fourth vow, from which only the pope can dispense, requiring them to
go wherever the pope may send them for missionary duty. The
Coadjutors teach in the schools, and are employed in general
missionary labors. The Society is governed by a General who holds
office for life. He has associated with him "Assistants" (five at the
present time), representing different provinces. The Society was
first established in the United States in 1807. The Jesuits have
displayed in their enterprises a high degree of zeal, learning, and
skill, but, by their enemies, have been generally reputed to use art
and intrigue in promoting or accomplishing their purposes, whence the
words Jesuit, Jesuitical, and the like, have acquired an opprobrious
sense.

Defn: A lunisolar calendar in use among Hebraic peoples, reckoning
from the year 3761 b. c., the date traditionally given for the
Creation. It received its present fixed form from Hillel II. about
360 a. d. The present names of the months, which are Babylonian-
Assyrian in origin, replaced older ones, Abib, Bul, etc., at the time
of the Babylonian Exile. Nineteen years constitute a lunar cycle, of
which the 3d, 6th, 8th, 11th, 14th, 17th, and 19th years are leap
years. The year 5663 [1902-3 a. d.] was the first year of the 299th
lunar cycle. The common year is said to be defective, regular, or
perfect (or abundant) according as it has 353, 354, or 355 days. The
leap year has an intercalary month, and a total of 383 (defective),
384 (regular), or 385 (perfect, or abundant) days. The calendar is
complicated by various rules providing for the harmonious arrangement
of festivals, etc., so that no simple perpetual calendar can be
constructed. The following table gives the months in order, with the
number of days assigned to each. Only three months vary in length.
They are: Heshvan, which has 30 days in perfect years; Kislev, which
has 30 days in regular and perfect years; and Adar, which has 30 days
in leap years. The ecclesiastical year commences with Nisan and the
civil year with Tishri. The date of the first of Tishri, or the
Jewish New Year, is also given for the Jewish years 5661-5696 (1900-
1935 a. d.). From these tables it is possible to transform any Jewish
date into Christian, or vice versa, for the years 1900-1935 a. d.

Syn.
 -- Equity; law; right; rectitude; honesty; integrity; uprightness;
fairness; impartiality.
 -- Justice, Equity, Law. Justice and equity are the same; but human
laws, though designed to secure justice, are of necessity imperfect,
and hence what is strictly legal is at times far from being equitable
or just. Here a court of equity comes in to redress the grievances.
It does so, as distinguished from courts of law; and as the latter
are often styled courts of justice, some have fancied that there is
in this case a conflict between justice and equity. The real conflict
is against the working of the law; this a court of equity brings into
accordance with the claims of justice. It would be an unfortunate use
of language which should lead any one to imagine he might have
justice on his side while practicing iniquity (inequity). Justice,
Rectitude. Rectitude, in its widest sense, is one of the most
comprehensive words in our language, denoting absolute conformity to
the rule of right in principle and practice. Justice refers more
especially to the carrying out of law, and has been considered by
moralists as of three kinds: (1) Commutative justice, which gives
every man his own property, including things pledged by promise. (2)
Distributive justice, which gives every man his exact deserts. (3)
General justice, which carries out all the ends of law, though not in
every case through the precise channels of commutative or
distributive justice; as we see often done by a parent or a ruler in
his dealings with those who are subject to his control.

before the first person plural, let has a hortative force. " Rise up,

to which they adhere with great tenacity. They are often improperly

the Schwendener hypothesis), is that they are not autonomous plants,

cells, and it is argued that the two are of different nature, the one
living at the expense of the other. See Hyph?, and Gonidia.

preterit lay; as, he told me to lie down, and I lay down. Some
persons blunder by using laid for the preterit of lie; as, he told me
to lie down, and I laid down. So persons often say incorrectly, the
ship laid at anchor; they laid by during the storm; the book was
laying on the shelf, etc. It is only necessary to remember, in all
such cases, that laid is the preterit of lay, and not of lie. To lie
along the shore (Naut.), to coast, keeping land in sight.

shine, Gr. ruc to shine. Lucid, Lunar, Luminous, Lynx.]

1. That agent, force, or action in nature by the operation of which

particles, or corpuscules, sent off in all directions from luminous
bodies, and traversing space, in right lines, with the known velocity
of about 186,300 miles per second; but it is now generally understood
to consist, not in any actual transmission of particles or substance,
but in the propagation of vibrations or undulations in a subtile,
elastic medium, or ether, assumed to pervade all space, and to be
thus set in vibratory motion by the action of luminous bodies, as the
atmosphere is by sonorous bodies. This view of the nature of light is
known as the undulatory or wave theory; the other, advocated by
Newton (but long since abandoned), as the corpuscular, emission, or
Newtonian theory. A more recent theory makes light to consist in
electrical oscillations, and is known as the electro-magnetic theory
of light.

Syn.
 -- Science; learning; erudition; belles-lettres. See Science.
 -- Literature, Learning, Erudition. Literature, in its widest sense,
embraces all compositions in writing or print which preserve the
results of observation, thought, or fancy; but those upon the
positive sciences (mathematics, etc.) are usually excluded. It is
often confined, however, to belles-lettres, or works of taste and
sentiment, as poetry, eloquence, history, etc., excluding abstract
discussions and mere erudition. A man of literature (in this
narrowest sense) is one who is versed in belles-lettres; a man of
learning excels in what is taught in the schools, and has a wide
extent of knowledge, especially, in respect to the past; a man of
erudition is one who is skilled in the more recondite branches of
learned inquiry.

Log"a*rithm, n. Etym: [Gr. logarithme.] (Math.)

Defn: One of a class of auxiliary numbers, devised by John Napier, of

calculations, by the use of addition and subtraction in place of
multiplication and division.

Note: The relation of logarithms to common numbers is that of numbers
in an arithmetical series to corresponding numbers in a geometrical
series, so that sums and differences of the former indicate
respectively products and quotients of the latter; thus
0 1 2 3 4 Indices or logarithms 1 10 100 1000 10,000 Numbers in
geometrical progression Hence, the logarithm of any given number is
the exponent of a power to which another given invariable number,
called the base, must be raised in order to produce that given
number. Thus, let 10 be the base, then 2 is the logarithm of 100,
because 102 = 100, and 3 is the logarithm of 1,000, because 103 =
1,000. Arithmetical complement of a logarithm, the difference between
a logarithm and the number ten.

subtraction. They were suggested by the celebrated German
mathematician Karl Friedrich Gauss (died in 1855), and are of great
service in many astronomical computations.
