or Spain or in the States which were once such colonies, esp. a

of Mexico.

Note: "The term creole negro is employed in the English West Indies
to distinguish the negroes born there from the Africans imported
during the time of the slave trade. The application of this term to
the colored people has led to an idea common in some parts of the
United States, though wholly unfounded, that it implies an admixture
greater or less of African blood." R. Hildreth.

Note: "The title [Creole] did not first belong to the descendants of
Spanish, but of French, settlers, But such a meaning implied a
certain excellence of origin, and so came early to include any native
of French or Spanish descent by either parent, whose nonalliance with
the slave race entitled him to social rank. Later, the term was
adopted by, not conceded to, the natives of mixed blood, and is still
so used among themselves. . . . Besides French and Spanish, there are
even, for convenience of speech, 'colored' Creoles; but there are no
Italian, or Sicilian, nor any English, Scotch, Irish, or 'Yankee'
Creoles, unless of parentage married into, and themselves thoroughly
proselyted in, Creole society." G. W. Cable.

Syn.
 -- Death, Decrase, Departure, Release. Death applies to the
termination of every form of existence, both animal and vegetable;
the other words only to the human race. Decease is the term used in
law for the removal of a human being out of life in the ordinary
course of nature. Demise was formerly confined to decease of princes,
but is now sometimes used of distinguished men in general; as, the
demise of Mr. Pitt. Departure and release are peculiarly terms of

decease. Departure implies a friendly taking leave of life. Release
implies a deliverance from a life of suffering or sorrow.

in the victim, and intention to deceive in the deluder. But it is
often used reflexively, indicating that a person's own weakness has
made him the sport of others or of fortune; as, he deluded himself
with a belief that luck would always favor him. To mislead is to

short. It implies that several courses of action have been presented
to the mind, and that the choice is now finally made. It supposes,
therefore, a union of promptitude and energy. Determination is the
natural consequence of decision. It is the settling of a thing with a
fixed purpose to adhere. Resolution is the necessary result in a mind
which is characterized by firmness. It is a spirit which scatters
(resolves) all doubt, and is ready to face danger or suffering in

Syn.
 -- Decline, Decay, Consumption. Decline marks the first stage in a
downward progress; decay indicates the second stage, and denotes a
tendency to ultimate destruction; consumption marks a steady decay
from an internal exhaustion of strength. The health may experience a
decline from various causes at any period of life; it is naturally
subject to decay with the advance of old age; consumption may take
place at almost any period of life, from disease which wears out the
constitution. In popular language decline is often used as synonymous
with consumption. By a gradual decline, states and communities lose
their strength and vigor; by progressive decay, they are stripped of
their honor, stability, and greatness; by a consumption of their
resources and vital energy, they are led rapidly on to a completion
of their existence.

3. That which is falsely or delusively believed or propagated; false

Syn.
 -- Delusion, Illusion. These words both imply some deception
practiced upon the mind. Delusion is deception from want of
knowledge; illusion is deception from morbid imagination. An illusion
is a false show, a mere cheat on the fancy or senses. It is, in other
words, some idea or image presented to the bodily or mental vision
which does not exist in reality. A delusion is a false judgment,
usually affecting the real concerns of life. Or, in other words, it
is an erroneous view of something which exists indeed, but has by no
means the qualities or attributes ascribed to it. Thus we speak of
the illusions of fancy, the illusions of hope, illusive prospects,
illusive appearances, etc. In like manner, we speak of the delusions
of stockjobbing, the delusions of honorable men, delusive appearances
in trade, of being deluded by a seeming excellence. "A fanatic,
either religious or political, is the subject of strong delusions;
while the term illusion is applied solely to the visions of an
uncontrolled imagination, the chimerical ideas of one blinded by
hope, passion, or credulity, or lastly, to spectral and other ocular
deceptions, to which the word delusion is never applied." Whately.

 -- Depravity, Depravation, Corruption. Depravilty is a vitiated
state of mind or feeling; as, the depravity of the human heart;
depravity of public morals. Depravation points to the act or process
of making depraved, and hence to the end thus reached; as, a gradual
depravation of principle; a depravation of manners, of the heart,
etc. Corruption is the only one of these words which applies to
physical substances, and in reference to these denotes the process by
which their component parts are dissolved. Hence, when figuratively
used, it denotes an utter vitiation of principle or feeling.
Depravity applies only to the mind and heart: we can speak of a
depraved taste, or a corrupt taste; in the first we introduce the
notion that there has been the influence of bad training to pervert;
in the second, that there is a want of true principle to pervert; in
the second, that there is a want of true principles to decide. The
other two words have a wider use: we can speak of the depravation or
the corruption of taste and public sentiment. Depravity is more or
less open; corruption is more or less disguised in its operations.
What is depraved requires to be reformed; what is corrupt requires to
be purified.

DIS-
Dis- (; 258)

Defn: .

1. A prefix from the Latin, whence F. des, or sometimes de-, dis-.
The Latin dis- appears as di- before b, d, g, l, m, n, r, v, becomes
dif- before f, and either dis- or di- before j. It is from the same
root as bis twice, and duo, E. two. See Two, and cf. Bi-, Di-, Dia-.
Dis- denotes separation, a parting from, as in distribute,
disconnect; hence it often has the force of a privative and negative,
as in disarm, disoblige, disagree. Also intensive, as in dissever.

Note: Walker's rule of pronouncing this prefix is, that the s ought
always to be pronounced like z, when the next syllable is accented
and begins with "a flat mute [b, d, v, g, z], a liquid [l, m, n, r],
or a vowel; as, disable, disease, disorder, disuse, disband, disdain,
disgrace, disvalue, disjoin, dislike, dislodge, dismay, dismember,
dismiss, dismount, disnatured, disrank, disrelish, disrobe." Dr.
Webster's example in disapproving of Walker's rule and pronouncing
dis- as diz in only one (disease) of the above words, is followed by
recent orthoepists. See Disable, Disgrace, and the other words,
beginning with dis-, in this Dictionary.

reluctance to make the necessary sacrifices, and a repugnance to the

feeling; as, a disgust at gross exhibitions of selfishness. Antipathy
is primarily an instinctive feeling of dislike of a thing, such as
most persons feel for a snake. When used figuratively, it denotes a
correspondent dislike for certain persons, modes of acting, etc. Men
have an aversion to what breaks in upon their habits; a reluctance
and repugnance to what crosses their will; a disgust at what offends
their sensibilities; and are often governed by antipathies for which
they can give no good reason.

did are in common use. I do not wish to see them; what do you think
Did C?sar cross the Tiber He did not. "Do you love me" Shak. (d) Do,
as an auxiliary, is supposed to have been first used before
imperatives. It expresses entreaty or earnest request; as, do help
me. In the imperative mood, but not in the indicative, it may be used
with the verb to be; as, do be quiet. Do, did, and done often stand
as a general substitute or representative verb, and thus save the
repetition of the principal verb. "To live and die is all we have to
do." Denham. In the case of do and did as auxiliaries, the sense may
be completed by the infinitive (without to) of the verb represented.

Syn.
 -- To Draw, Drag. Draw differs from drag in this, that drag implies

the more general or generic term, and drag the more specific. We say,
the horses draw a coach or wagon, but they drag it through mire; yet
draw is properly used in both cases.

principal being its long or name sound, as in eve, me, and the short,

to indicate that the preceding vowel has its long sound, where
otherwise it would be short, as in mane, as in cane, m, which without
the final e would be pronounced m, c, m. After c and g, the final e
indicates that these letters are to be pronounced as s and j;
respectively, as in lace, rage. See Guide to Pronunciation, �� 74-97.

ausis, Russ. ukho, Gr. audire to hear, Gr. av to favor , protect. Cf.
Auricle, Orillon.]

1. The organ of hearing; the external ear.

Note: In man and the higher vertebrates, the organ of hearing is very
complicated, and is divisible into three parts: the external ear,
which includes the pinna or auricle and meatus or external opening;
the middle ear, drum, or tympanum; and the internal ear, or
labyrinth. The middle ear is a cavity connected by the Eustachian
tube with the pharynx, separated from the opening of the external ear
by the tympanic membrane, and containing a chain of three small
bones, or ossicles, named malleus, incus, and stapes, which connect
this membrane with the internal ear. The essential part of the
internal ear where the fibers of the auditory nerve terminate, is the
membranous labyrinth, a complicated system of sacs and tubes filled
with a fluid (the endolymph), and lodged in a cavity, called the bony
labyrinth, in the periotic bone. The membranous labyrinth does not
completely fill the bony labyrinth, but is partially suspended in it
in a fluid (the perilymph). The bony labyrinth consists of a central
cavity, the vestibule, into which three semicircular canals and the
canal of the cochlea (spirally coiled in mammals) open. The
vestibular portion of the membranous labyrinth consists of two sacs,
the utriculus and sacculus, connected by a narrow tube, into the
former of which three membranous semicircular canals open, while the
latter is connected with a membranous tube in the cochlea containing
the organ of Corti. By the help of the external ear the sonorous
vibrations of the air are concentrated upon the tympanic membrane and
set it vibrating, the chain of bones in the middle ear transmits
these vibrations to the internal ear, where they cause certain
delicate structures in the organ of Corti, and other parts of the
membranous labyrinth, to stimulate the fibers of the auditory nerve
to transmit sonorous impulses to the brain.

2. The sense of hearing; the perception of sounds; the power of
discriminating between different tones; as, a nice ear for music; --
in the singular only.

3. That which resembles in shape or position the ear of an animal;
any prominence or projection on an object, -- usually one for support
or attachment; a lug; a handle; as, the ears of a tub, a skillet, or

EASTERN CHURCH
Eastern Church.

Defn: That portion of the Christian church which prevails in the
countries once comprised in the Eastern Roman Empire and the
countries converted to Christianity by missionaries from them. Its
full official title is The Orthodox Catholic Apostolic Eastern
Church. It became estranged from the Western, or Roman, Church over
the question of papal supremacy and the doctrine of the filioque, and
a separation, begun in the latter part of the 9th century, became
final in 1054. The Eastern Church consists of twelve (thirteen if the
Bulgarian Church be included) mutually independent churches
(including among these the Hellenic Church, or Church of Greece, and
the Russian Church), using the vernacular (or some ancient form of
it) in divine service and varying in many points of detail, but
standing in full communion with each other and united as equals in a
great federation. The highest five authorities are the patriarch of
Constantinople, or ecumenical patriarch (whose position is not one of
supremacy, but of precedence), the patriarch of Alexandria, the
patriarch of Jerusalem, the patriarch of Antioch, and the Holy Synod
of Russia. The Eastern Church accepts the first seven ecumenical
councils (and is hence styled only schismatic, not heretical, by the
Roman Catholic Church), has as its creed the Niceno-
Constantinopolitan (without the later addition of the filioque,
which, with the doctrine it represents, the church decisively
rejects), baptizes infants with trine immersion, makes confirmation
follow immediately upon baptism, administers the Communion in both
kinds (using leavened bread) and to infants as well as adults,
permits its secular clergy to marry before ordination and to keep
their wives afterward, but not to marry a second time, selects its
bishops from the monastic clergy only, recognizes the offices of
bishop, priest, and deacon as the three necessary degrees of orders,
venerates relics and icons, and has an elaborate ritual.

Syn.
 -- Effect, Consequence, Result. These words indicate things which

consequence is more remote, not being strictly caused, nor yet a mere
sequence, but following out of and following indirectly, or in the
train of events, something on which it truly depends. A result is
still more remote and variable, like the rebound of an elastic body
which falls in very different directions. We may foresee the effects
of a measure, may conjecture its consequences, but can rarely
discover its final results.

ELEMENT
El"e*ment, n. Etym: [F. element, L. elementum.]

1. One of the simplest or essential parts or principles of which
anything consists, or upon which the constitution or fundamental
powers of anything are based.

2. One of the ultimate, undecomposable constituents of any kind of
matter. Specifically: (Chem.) A substance which cannot be decomposed
into different kinds of matter by any means at present employed; as,
the elements of water are oxygen and hydrogen.

Note: The elements are naturally classified in several families or
groups, as the group of the alkaline elements, the halogen group, and
the like. They are roughly divided into two great classes, the
metals, as sodium, calcium, etc., which form basic compounds, and the
nonmetals or metalloids, as oxygen, sulphur, chlorine, which form
acid compounds; but the distinction is only relative, and some, as
arsenic, tin, aluminium, etc., form both acid and basic compounds.
The essential fact regarding every element is its relative atomic
weight or equivalent. When the elements are tabulated in the order of
their ascending atomic weights, the arrangement constitutes the
series of the Periodic law of Mendelejeff. See Periodic law, under
Periodic. This Periodic law enables us to predict the qualities of
unknown elements. The number of elements known is about seventy-five,
but the gaps in the Periodic law indicate the possibility of many
more. Many of the elements with which we are familiar, as hydrogen,
carbon, iron, gold, etc., have been recognized, by means of spectrum
analysis, in the sun and the fixed stars. From certain evidence (as
that afforded by the Periodic law, spectrum analysis, etc.) it
appears that the chemical elements probably may not be simple bodies,
but only very stable compounds of some simpler body or bodies. In
formulas, the elements are designated by abbreviations of their names
in Latin or New Latin.
