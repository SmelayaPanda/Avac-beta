MALARIA PARASITE
Malaria parasite.

Defn: Any of several minute protozoans of the genus Plasmodium (syn.
H?matozoon) which in their adult condition live in the tissues of
mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles (which see) and when transferred to
the blood of man, by the bite of the mosquito, produce malaria. The
young parasites, or sporozoites, enter the red blood corpuscles,
growing at their expense, undergoing sporulation, and finally
destroying the corpuscles, thus liberating in the blood plasma an
immense number of small spores called merozoites. An indefinite but
not ultimated number of such generations may follow, but if meanwhile
the host is bitten by a mosquito, the parasites develop into gametes
in the stomach of the insect. These conjugate, the zygote thus
produced divides, forming spores, and eventually sporozoites, which,
penetrating to the salivary glands of the mosquito, may be introduced
into a new host. The attacks of the disease coincide with the
dissolution of the corpuscles and liberation of the spores and
products of growth of the parasites into the blood plasma. Several
species of the parasite are distinguished, as P. vivax, producing
tertian malaria; P. malari?, quartan malaria; and P. (subgenus
Laverania) falciferum, the malarial fever of summer and autumn common
in the tropics.

Syn.
 -- Memory, Remembrance, Recollection, Reminiscence. Memory is the
generic term, denoting the power by which we reproduce past
impressions. Remembrance is an exercise of that power when things
occur spontaneously to our thoughts. In recollection we make a
distinct effort to collect again, or call back, what we know has been
formerly in the mind. Reminiscence is intermediate between
remembrance and recollection, being a conscious process of recalling
past occurrences, but without that full and varied reference to
particular things which characterizes recollection. "When an idea
again recurs without the operation of the like object on the external
sensory, it is remembrance; if it be sought after by the mind, and
with pain and endeavor found, and brought again into view, it is
recollection." Locke. To draw to memory, to put on record; to record.

MENDELIAN CHARACTER
Mendelian character. (Biol.)

Defn: A character which obeys Mendel's law in regard to its

MENDEL'S LAW
Men"del's law.

Defn: A principle governing the inheritance of many characters in
animals and plants, discovered by Gregor J. Mendel (Austrian
Augustinian abbot, 1822-84) in breeding experiments with peas. He
showed that the height, color, and other characters depend on the
presence of determinating factors behaving as units. In any given
germ cell each of these is either present or absent. The following
example (using letters as symbols of the determining factors and
hence also of the individuals possessing them) shows the operation of
the law: Tallness being due to a factor T, a tall plant, arising by
the union in fertilization of two germ cells both bearing this
factor, is TT; a dwarf, being without T, is tt. Crossing these,
crossbreeds, Tt, result (called generation F1). In the formation of
the germ cells of these crossbreeds a process of segregation occurs
such that germ cells, whether male or female, are produced of two
kinds, T and t, in equal numbers. The T cells bear the factor
"tallness," the t cells are devoid of it. The offspring, generation
F2, which arise from the chance union of these germ cells in pairs,
according to the law of probability, are therefore on an average in
the following proportions:

1 TT : 2 Tt : 1 tt;

and thus plants pure in tallness (TT) and dwarfness (tt), as well as
crossbreeds (Tt), are formed by the interbreeding of crossbreeds.
Frequently, as in this example, owning to what is called the
dominance of a factor, the operation of Mendel's law may be
complicated by the fact that when a dominant factor (as T) occurs
with its allelomorph (as t), called recessive, in the crossbreed Tt,
the individual Tt is itself indistinguishable from the pure form TT.
Generation F1, containing only the Tt form, consists entirely of
dominants (tall plants) and generation F2 consists of three dominants
(2 Tt, 1 TT) to one dwarf (tt), which, displaying the feature
suppressed in F1, is called recessive. Such qualitative and numerical
regularity has been proved to exist in regard to very diverse
qualities or characters which compose living things, both wild and
domesticated, such as colors of flowers, of hair or eyes, patterns,
structure, chemical composition, and power of resisting certain
diseases. The diversity of forms produced in crossbreeding by
horticulturists and fanciers generally results from a process of
analytical variation or recombination of the factors composing the
parental types. Purity of type consequently acquires a specific
meaning. An individual is pure in respect of a given character when
it results from the union of two sexual cells both bearing that
character, or both without it.

METAPHYSICS
Met`a*phys"ics, n. Etym: [Gr. metaphysique. See Physics. The term was
first used by the followers of Aristotle as a name for that part of
his writings which came after, or followed, the part which treated of
physics.]

1. The science of real as distinguished from phenomenal being;
ontology; also, the science of being, with reference to its abstract
and universal conditions, as distinguished from the science of
determined or concrete being; the science of the conceptions and
relations which are necessarily implied as true of every kind of
being; phylosophy in general; first principles, or the science of
first principles.

Note: Metaphysics is distinguished as general and special. General
metaphysics is the science of all being as being. Special metaphysics
is the science of one kind of being; as, the metaphysics of
chemistry, of morals, or of politics. According to Kant, a systematic
exposition of those notions and truths, the knowledge of which is
altogether independent of experience, would constitute the science of
metaphysics.
Commonly, in the schools, called metaphysics, as being part of the
philosophy of Aristotle, which hath that for title; but it is in
another sense: for there it signifieth as much as "books written or
placed after his natural philosophy." But the schools take them for
"books of supernatural philosophy;" for the word metaphysic will bear
both these senses. Hobbes.
Now the science conversant about all such inferences of unknown being
from its known manifestations, is called ontology, or metaphysics
proper. Sir W. Hamilton.
Metaphysics are [is] the science which determines what can and what
can not be known of being, and the laws of being, a priori.
Coleridge.

2. Hence: The scientific knowledge of mental phenomena; mental
philosophy; psychology.
Metaphysics, in whatever latitude the term be taken, is a science or
complement of sciences exclusively occupied with mind. Sir W.
Hamilton.
Whether, after all, A larger metaphysics might not help Our physics.

that their gratitude made them, notwithstanding his prohibition,
proclaim the wonders he had done. Dr. H. More.

Note: Notwithstanding was, by Johnson and Webster, viewed as a
participle absolute, an English equivalent of the Latin non obstante.
Its several meanings, either as preposition, adverb, or conjunction,
are capable of being explained in this view. Later grammarians, while
admitting that the word was originally a participle, and can be
treated as such, prefer to class it as a preposition or disjunctive
conjunction.

Syn.
 -- In spite of; despite.
 -- Notwithstanding, In spite of, Despite. These words and phrases
are often interchanged, but there is a difference between them,
chiefly in strength. Notwithstanding is the weaker term, and simply
points to some obstacle that may exist; as, I shall go,
notwithstanding the rain. In spite or despite of has reference
primarily to active opposition to be encountered from others; as,
"I'll be, in man's despite, a monarch; " "I'll keep mine own, despite
of all the world." Shak. Hence, these words, when applied to things,
suppose greater opposition than notwithstanding. We should say. "He
was thrust rudely out of doors in spite of his entreaties," rather
than "notwithstanding". On the other hand, it would be more civil to
say, "Notwithstanding all you have said, I must still differ with
you."

NOTWITHSTANDING
Not`with*stand"ing, adv. or conj. Etym: [Originally the participle of
withstand, with not prefixed.]

Defn: Nevertheless; however; although; as, I shall go,

O

1. O, the fifteenth letter of the English alphabet, derives its form,
value, and name from the Greek O, through the Latin. The letter came
into the Greek from the Phoenician, which possibly derived it
ultimately from the Egyptian. Etymologically, the letter o is most
closely related to a, e, and u; as in E. bone, AS. ban; E. stone, AS.
stan; E. broke, AS. brecan to break; E. bore, AS. beran to bear; E.
dove, AS. dufe; E. toft, tuft; tone, tune; number, F. nombre. The
letter o has several vowel sounds, the principal of which are its
long sound, as in bone, its short sound, as in nod, and the sounds
heard in the words orb, son, do (feod), and wolf (book). In
connection with the other vowels it forms several digraphs and
diphthongs. See Guide to Pronunciation,  107-129.

2. Among the ancients, O was a mark of triple time, from the notion
that the ternary, or number 3, is the most perfect of numbers, and
properly expressed by a circle, the most perfect figure. O was also
anciently used to represent 11: with a dash over it (O
O, n.; pl. O's or Oes (.

1. The letter O, or its sound. "Mouthing out his hollow oes and aes."

For ever, O Lord, thy word is settled in heaven. Ps. cxix. 89.
O how love I thy law ! it is my meditation all the day. Ps. cxix. 97.

Note: O is frequently followed by an ellipsis and that, an in
expressing a wish: "O [I wish] that Ishmael might live before thee !"
Gen. xvii. 18; or in expressions of surprise, indignation, or regret:
"O [it is sad] that such eyes should e'er meet other object !"
Sheridan Knowles.

Note: A distinction between the use of O and oh is insisted upon by
some, namely, that O should be used only in direct address to a
person or personified object, and should never be followed by the
exclamation point, while Oh (or oh) should be used in exclamations
where no direct appeal or address to an object is made, and may be
followed by the exclamation point or not, according to the nature or
construction of the sentence. Some insist that oh should be used only
as an interjection expressing strong feeling. The form O, however,
is, it seems, the one most commonly employed for both uses by modern
writers and correctors for the press. "O, I am slain !" Shak. "O what
a fair and ministering angel !" "O sweet angel !" Longfellow.
O for a kindling touch from that pure flame ! Wordsworth.
But she is in her grave, -- and oh The difference to me ! Wordsworth.
Oh for a lodge in some vast wilderness ! Cowper.
We should distinguish between the sign of the vocative and the
emotional interjection, writing O for the former, and oh for the
latter. Earle.
O dear, and O dear me! Etym: [corrupted fr. F. O Dieu! or It. O Dio!
O God! O Dio mio! O my God! Wyman], exclamations expressive of
various emotions, but usually promoted by surprise, consternation,
grief, pain, etc.

OBJECTIVE
Ob*jec"tive, a. Etym: [Cf.F. objectif.]

1. Of or pertaining to an object.

2. (Metaph.)

Defn: Of or pertaining to an object; contained in, or having the
nature or position of, an object; outward; external; extrinsic; -- an
epithet applied to whatever ir exterior to the mind, or which is
simply an object of thought or feeling, and opposed to subjective.
In the Middle Ages, subject meant substance, and has this sense in
Descartes and Spinoza: sometimes, also, in Reid. Subjective is used
by William of Occam to denote that which exists independent of mind;
objective, what is formed by the mind. This shows what is meant by
realitas objectiva in Descartes. Kant and Fichte have inverted the
meanings. Subject, with them, is the mind which knows; object, that
which is known; subjective, the varying conditions of the knowing
mind; objective, that which is in the constant nature of the thing
known. Trendelenburg.
Objective means that which belongs to, or proceeds from, the object
known, and not from the subject knowing, and thus denotes what is
real, in opposition to that which is ideal -- what exists in nature,
in contrast to what exists merely in the thought of the individual.
Sir. W. Hamilton.
Objective has come to mean that which has independent exostence or
authority, apart from our experience or thought. Thus, moral law is
said to have objective authority, that is, authority belonging to
itself, and not drawn from anything in our nature. Calderwood
(Fleming's Vocabulary).

3. (Gram.)

Defn: Pertaining to, or designating, the case which follows a
transitive verb or a preposition, being that case in which the direct
object of the verb is placed. See Accusative, n.

Note: The objective case is frequently used without a governing word,
esp. in designations of time or space, where a preposition, as at,
in, on, etc., may be supplied.
My troublous dream [on] this night make me sad. Shak.
To write of victories [in or for] next year. Hudibras.
Objective line (Perspective), a line drawn on the geometrical plane
which is represented or sought to be represented.
 -- Objective plane (Perspective), any plane in the horizontal plane
that is represented.
 -- Objective point, the point or result to which the operations of
an army are directed. By extension, the point or purpose to which
anything, as a journey or an argument, is directed.

Syn.
 -- Objective, Subjective. Objective is applied to things exterior to
the mind, and objects of its attention; subjective, to the operations
of the mind itself. Hence, an objective motive is some outward thing
awakening desire; a subjective motive is some internal feeling or
propensity. Objective views are those governed by outward things;
subjective views are produced or modified by internal feeling. Sir
Walter Scott's poetry is chiefly objective; that of Wordsworth is
eminently subjective.
In the philosophy of mind, subjective denotes what is to be referred
to the thinking subject, the ego; objective what belongs to the
object of thought, the non-ego. Sir. W. Hamilton

acquire, in any way.
Some pray for riches; riches they obtain. Dryden.
By guileful fair words peace may be obtained. Shak.
It may be that I may obtain children by her. Gen. xvi. 2.

Syn.
 -- To attain; gain; procure; acquire; win; earn. See Attain.
 -- To Obtain, Get, Gain, Earn, Acquire. The idea of getting is
common to all these terms. We may, indeed, with only a slight change
of sense, substitute get for either of them; as, to get or to gain a
prize; to get or to obtain an employment; to get or to earn a living;
to get or to acquire a language. To gain is to get by striving; and
as this is often a part of our good fortune, the word gain is
peculiarly applicable to whatever comes to us fortuitously. Thus, we
gain a victory, we gain a cause, we gain an advantage, etc. To earn
is to deserve by labor or service; as, to earn good wages; to earn a
triumph. Unfortunately, one does not always get or obtain what he has
earned. To obtain implies desire for possession, and some effort
directed to the attainment of that which is not immediately within
our reach. Whatever we thus seek and get, we obtain, whether by our
own exertions or those of others; whether by good or bad means;
whether permanently, or only for a time. Thus, a man obtains an
employment; he obtains an answer to a letter, etc. To acquire is more
limited and specific. We acquire what comes to us gradually in the
regular exercise of our abilities, while we obtain what comes in any
way, provided we desire it. Thus, we acquire knowledge, property,
honor, reputation, etc. What we acquire becomes, to a great extent,
permanently our own; as, to acquire a language; to acquire habits of
industry, etc.
