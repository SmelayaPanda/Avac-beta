Sw. & Dan. guld, Goth. gulp, Russ. & OSlav. zlato; prob. akin to E.
yellow. Yellow, and cf. Gild, v. t.]

1. (Chem.)

Defn: A metallic element, constituting the most precious metal used
as a common commercial medium of exchange. It has a characteristic
yellow color, is one of the heaviest substances known (specific
gravity 19.32), is soft, and very malleable and ductile. It is quite
unalterable by heat, moisture, and most corrosive agents, and
therefore well suited for its use in coin and jewelry. Symbol Au
(Aurum). Atomic weight 196.7.

Note: Native gold contains usually eight to ten per cent of silver,
but often much more. As the amount of silver increases, the color
becomes whiter and the specific gravity lower. Gold is very widely
disseminated, as in the sands of many rivers, but in very small
quantity. It usually occurs in quartz veins (gold quartz), in slate
and metamorphic rocks, or in sand and alluvial soil, resulting from
the disintegration of such rocks. It also occurs associated with
other metallic substances, as in auriferous pyrites, and is combined
with tellurium in the minerals petzite, calaverite, sylvanite, etc.
Pure gold is too soft for ordinary use, and is hardened by alloying
with silver and copper, the latter giving a characteristic reddish
tinge. [See Carat.] Gold also finds use in gold foil, in the pigment
purple of Cassius, and in the chloride, which is used as a toning
agent in photography.

2. Money; riches; wealth.
For me, the gold of France did not seduce. Shak.

H

Defn: the eighth letter of the English alphabet, is classed among the
consonants, and is formed with the mouth organs in the same position
as that of the succeeding vowel. It is used with certain consonants
to form digraphs representing sounds which are not found in the
alphabet, as sh, th, th, as in shall, thing, thine (for zh see 274);
also, to modify the sounds of some other letters, as when placed
after c and p, with the former of which it represents a compound
sound like that of tsh, as in charm (written also tch as in catch),
with the latter, the sound of f, as in phase, phantom. In some words,
mostly derived or introduced from foreign languages, h following c
and g indicates that those consonants have the hard sound before e,
i, and y, as in chemistry, chiromancy, chyle, Ghent, Ghibelline,
etc.; in some others, ch has the sound of sh, as in chicane. See
Guide to Pronunciation,  153, 179, 181-3, 237-8.

Note: The name (aitch) is from the French ache; its form is from the
Latin, and this from the Greek H, which was used as the sign of the
spiritus asper (rough breathing) before it came to represent the long
vowel, Gr. e. The Greek H is from Phoenician, the ultimate origin
probably being Egyptian. Etymologically H is most closely related to
c; as in E. horn, L. cornu, Gr. ke`ras; E. hele, v. t., conceal; E.
hide, L. cutis, Gr. ky`tos; E. hundred, L. centum, Gr. 'e-kat-on,

To do the handsome thing, to act liberally. [Colloq.]

Syn.
 -- Handsome, Pretty. Pretty applies to things comparatively small,
which please by their delicacy and grace; as, a pretty girl, a pretty
flower, a pretty cottage. Handsome rises higher, and is applied to
objects on a larger scale. We admire what is handsome, we are pleased
with what is pretty. The word is connected with hand, and has thus
acquired the idea of training, cultivation, symmetry, and proportion,
which enters so largely into our conception of handsome. Thus Drayton
makes mention of handsome players, meaning those, who are well
trained; and hence we speak of a man's having a handsome address,
which is the result of culture; of a handsome horse or dog, which
implies well proportioned limbs; of a handsome face, to which, among
other qualities, the idea of proportion and a graceful contour are
essential; of a handsome tree, and a handsome house or villa. So,
from this idea of proportion or suitableness, we have, with a
different application, the expressions, a handsome fortune, a
handsome offer.

helpen, G. helfen, OHG. helfan, Icel. hjalpa, Sw. hjelpa, Dan.

Syn.
 -- To aid; assist; succor; relieve; serve; support; sustain;
befriend.
 -- To Help, Aid, Assist. These words all agree in the idea of
affording relief or support to a person under difficulties. Help
turns attention especially to the source of relief. If I fall into a
pit, I call for help; and he who helps me out does it by an act of
his own. Aid turns attention to the other side, and supposes
cooperation on the part of him who is relieved; as, he aided me in
getting out of the pit; I got out by the aid of a ladder which he
brought. Assist has a primary reference to relief afforded by a
person who "stands by" in order to relieve. It denotes both help and
aid. Thus, we say of a person who is weak, I assisted him upstairs,
or, he mounted the stairs by my assistance. When help is used as a
noun, it points less distinctively and exclusively to the source of
relief, or, in other words, agrees more closely with aid. Thus we
say, I got out of a pit by the help of my friend.

1. (Zool.)

Defn: A hoofed quadruped of the genus Equus; especially, the domestic
horse (E. caballus), which was domesticated in Egypt and Asia at a
very early period. It has six broad molars, on each side of each jaw,
with six incisors, and two canine teeth, both above and below. The
mares usually have the canine teeth rudimentary or wanting. The horse
differs from the true asses, in having a long, flowing mane, and the
tail bushy to the base. Unlike the asses it has callosities, or
chestnuts, on all its legs. The horse excels in strength, speed,
docility, courage, and nobleness of character, and is used for
drawing, carrying, bearing a rider, and like purposes.

Note: Many varieties, differing in form, size, color, gait, speed,
etc., are known, but all are believed to have been derived from the
same original species. It is supposed to have been a native of the
plains of Central Asia, but the wild species from which it was
derived is not certainly known. The feral horses of America are
domestic horses that have run wild; and it is probably true that most
of those of Asia have a similar origin. Some of the true wild Asiatic
horses do, however, approach the domestic horse in several
characteristics. Several species of fossil (Equus) are known from the
later Tertiary formations of Europe and America. The fossil species
of other genera of the family Equid? are also often called horses, in

 -- However, At least, Nevertheless, Yet. These words, as here
compared, have an adversative sense in reference to something
referred to in the context. However is the most general, and leads to
a final conclusion or decision. Thus we say, the truth, however, has
not yet fully come out; i.e., such is the speaker's conclusion in
view of the whole case. So also we say, however, you may rely on my
assistance to that amount; i. e., at all events, whatever may happen,
this is my final decision. At least is adversative in another way. It
points out the utmost concession that can possibly be required, and
still marks the adversative conclusion; as, at least, this must be
done; whatever may be our love of peace, we must at least maintain
the rights of conscience. Nevertheless denotes that though the
concession be fully made, it has no bearing of the question; as,
nevertheless, we must go forward. Yet signifies that however extreme
the supposition or fact comceded may be, the consequence which might
naturally be expected does not and will not follow; as, though I
should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee; though he slay me,
yet will I trust in him. Cf. But.

I

1. I, the ninth letter of the English alphabet, takes its form from
the Phoenician, through the Latin and the Greek. The Phoenician
letter was probably of Egyptian origin. Its original value was nearly
the same as that of the Italian I, or long e as in mete.
Etymologically I is most closely related to e, y, j, g; as in dint,
dent, beverage, L. bibere; E. kin, AS. cynn; E. thin, AS. ynne; E.
dominion, donjon, dungeon. In English I has two principal vowel
sounds: the long sound, as in pine, ice; and the short sound, as in
pin. It has also three other sounds: (a) That of e in term, as in
thirst. (b) That of e in mete (in words of foreign origin), as in
machine, pique, regime. (c) That of consonant y (in many words in
which it precedes another vowel), as in bunion, million, filial,
Christian, etc. It enters into several digraphs, as in fail, field,
seize, feign. friend; and with o often forms a proper diphtong, as in
oil, join, coin.

See Guide to Pronunciation,  98-106.

Note: The dot which we place over the small or lower case i dates
only from the 14th century. The sounds of I and J were originally
represented by the same character, and even after the introduction of
the form J into English dictionaries, words containing these letters
were, till a comparatively recent time, classed together.

2. In our old authors, I was often used for ay (or aye), yes, which
is pronounced nearly like it.

3. As a numeral, I stands for 1, II for 2, etc.

IMAGINATION
Im*ag`i*na"tion, n. Etym: [OE. imaginacionum, F. imagination, fr. L.
imaginatio. See Imagine.]

1. The imagine-making power of the mind; the power to create or
reproduce ideally an object of sense previously perceived; the power
to call up mental imagines.
Our simple apprehension of corporeal objects, if present, is sense;
if absent, is imagination. Glanvill.
Imagination is of three kinds: joined with belief of that which is to
come; joined with memory of that which is past; and of things
present, or as if they were present. Bacon.

2. The representative power; the power to reconstruct or recombine
the materials furnished by direct apprehension; the complex faculty
usually termed the plastic or creative power; the fancy.
The imagination of common language -- the productive imagination of
philosophers -- is nothing but the representative process plus the
process to which I would give the name of the "comparative." Sir W.
Hamilton.
The power of the mind to decompose its conceptions, and to recombine
the elements of them at its pleasure, is called its faculty of
imagination. I. Taylor.
The business of conception is to present us with an exact transcript
of what we have felt or perceived. But we have moreover a power of
modifying our conceptions, by combining the parts of different ones
together, so as to form new wholes of our creation. I shall employ
the word imagination to express this power. Stewart.

3. The power to recombine the materials furnished by experience or
memory, for the accomplishment of an elevated purpose; the power of
conceiving and expressing the ideal.
The lunatic, the lover, and the poet Are of imagination all compact .
. . The poet's eye, in a fine frenzy rolling, Doth glance from heaven
to earth, from earth to heaven, And as imagination bodies forth The
forms of things unknown, the poet's pen Turns them to shapes, and
gives to airy nothing A local habitation and a name. Shak.

4. A mental image formed by the action of the imagination as a
faculty; a conception; a notion. Shak.

Syn.
 -- Conception; idea; conceit; fancy; device; origination; invention;
scheme; design; purpose; contrivance.
 -- Imagination, Fancy. These words have, to a great extent, been
interchanged by our best writers, and considered as strictly
synonymous. A distinction, however, is now made between them which
more fully exhibits their nature. Properly speaking, they are
different exercises of the same general power -- the plastic or
creative faculty. Imagination consists in taking parts of our
conceptions and combining them into new forms and images more select,
more striking, more delightful, more terrible, etc., than those of
ordinary nature. It is the higher exercise of the two. It creates by
laws more closely connected with the reason; it has strong emotion as
its actuating and formative cause; it aims at results of a definite
and weighty character. Milton's fiery lake, the debates of his
Pandemonium, the exquisite scenes of his Paradise, are all products
of the imagination. Fancy moves on a lighter wing; it is governed by
laws of association which are more remote, and sometimes arbitrary or
capricious. Hence the term fanciful, which exhibits fancy in its
wilder flights. It has for its actuating spirit feelings of a lively,
gay, and versatile character; it seeks to please by unexpected
combinations of thought, startling contrasts, flashes of brilliant
imagery, etc. Pope's Rape of the Lock is an exhibition of fancy which
has scarcely its equal in the literature of any country.
 -- "This, for instance, Wordworth did in respect of the words
`imagination' and `fancy.' Before he wrote, it was, I suppose,
obscurely felt by most that in `imagination' there was more of the
earnest, in `fancy' of the play of the spirit; that the first was a
loftier faculty and gift than the second; yet for all this words were
continually, and not without loss, confounded. He first, in the
preface to his Lyrical Ballads, rendered it henceforth impossible
that any one, who had read and mastered what he has written on the
two words, should remain unconscious any longer of the important
difference between them." Trench.
The same power, which we should call fancy if employed on a
production of a light nature, would be dignified with the title of
imagination if shown on a grander scale. C. J. Smith.

which it passes.
 -- Electro-static induction, the action by which a body possessing a
charge of statical electricity develops a charge of statical
electricity of the opposite character in a neighboring body.
 -- Induction coil, an apparatus producing induced currents of great
intensity. It consists of a coil or helix of stout insulated copper
wire, surrounded by another coil of very fine insulated wire, in

 -- Philosophical induction, the inference, or the act of inferring,
that what has been observed or established in respect to a part,
individual, or species, may, on the ground of analogy, be affirmed or
received of the whole to which it belongs. This last is the inductive
method of Bacon. It ascends from the parts to the whole, and forms,
from the general analogy of nature, or special presumptions in the
case, conclusions which have greater or less degrees of force, and
which may be strengthened or weakened by subsequent experience and
experiment. It relates to actual existences, as in physical science
or the concerns of life. Logical induction is founded on the
necessary laws of thought; philosophical induction, on the
interpretation of the indications or analogy of nature.

Syn.
 -- Deduction.
 -- Induction, Deduction. In induction we observe a sufficient number
of individual facts, and, on the ground of analogy, extend what is
true of them to others of the same class, thus arriving at general
principles or laws. This is the kind of reasoning in physical
science. In deduction we begin with a general truth, which is already
proven or provisionally assumed, and seek to connect it with some
particular case by means of a middle term, or class of objects, known
to be equally connected with both. Thus, we bring down the general
into the particular, affirming of the latter the distinctive
qualities of the former. This is the syllogistic method. By induction
Franklin established the identity of lightning and electricity; by
deduction he inferred that dwellings might be protected by lightning
rods.

argument. I. Watts.

brought in; and hence, a deduction or induction from premises, --
something which follows as certainly or probably true. A conclusion
is stronger than an inference; it shuts us up to the result, and
terminates inquiry. We infer what is particular or probable; we
conclude what is certain. In a chain of reasoning we have many
inferences, which lead to the ultimate conclusion. "An inference is a
proposition which is perceived to be true, because of its connection
with some known fact." "When something is simply affirmed to be true,
it is called a proposition; after it has been found to be true by
several reasons or arguments, it is called a conclusion." I. Taylor.

authority of Christianity; a Mohammedan; a heathen; a freethinker.

Note: Infidel is used by English writers to translate the equivalent
word used Mohammedans in speaking of Christians and other
disbelievers in Mohammedanism.

Syn.
 -- Infidel, Unbeliever, Freethinker, Deist, Atheist, Sceptic,
Agnostic. An infidel, in common usage, is one who denies Christianity
and the truth of the Scriptures. Some have endeavored to widen the
sense of infidel so as to embrace atheism and every form of unbelief;
but this use does not generally prevail. A freethinker is now only
another name for an infidel. An unbeliever is not necessarily a
disbeliever or infidel, because he may still be inquiring after
evidence to satisfy his mind; the word, however, is more commonly
used in the extreme sense. A deist believes in one God and a divine
providence, but rejects revelation. An atheist denies the being of
God. A sceptic is one whose faith in the credibility of evidence is
weakened or destroyed, so that religion, to the same extent, has no
practical hold on his mind. An agnostic remains in a state of
suspended judgment, neither affirming nor denying the existence of a
personal Deity.

which to is commonly placed, as, to speak; to go; to hear. (b) The
form of the imperfect participle, called the infinitive in -ing; as,
going is as easy as standing.

Note: With the auxiliary verbs may, can, must, might, could, would,

the verbs let, dare, do, bid, make, see, hear, need, etc.; as, let me
go; you dare not tell; make him work; hear him talk, etc.

(the sign of modern simple infinitive), but it had a dative form
(sometimes called the gerundial infinitive) which was preceded by to,
and was chiefly employed in expressing purpose. See Gerund, 2.
