Dicotyledons (called also Exogens).
 -- Seeds with two or more cotyledons. Stems with the pith, woody

annular ducts, and the seed contained in a true ovary; Gymnosperms,
having few or no ducts in the woody fiber, and the seeds naked. 2.
Monocotyledons (called also Endogens).
 -- Seeds with single cotyledon. Stems with slender bundles of woody
fiber not concentrically arranged, and with no true bark.} II.

other sexual and oophoric. Divided into Vascular Acrogens, or
Pteridophyta, having the sporophoric plant conspicuous and consisting
partly of vascular tissue, as in Ferns, Lycopods, and Equiseta, and
Cellular Acrogens, or Bryophyta, having the sexual plant most
conspicuous, but destitute of vascular tissue, as in Mosses and Scale
Mosses. 2. Thallogens.
 -- Plants without distinct stem and leaves, consisting of a simple
or branched mass of cellular tissue, or educed to a single cell.

chlorophyll or its equivalent, and which live upon air and water, and
Fungi, which contain no chlorophyll, and live on organic matter.
(Lichens are now believed to be fungi parasitic on included alg?.}

Note: Many botanists divide the Ph?nogamia primarily into Gymnosperms
and Angiosperms, and the latter into Dicotyledons and Monocotyledons.
Others consider Pteridophyta and Bryophyta to be separate classes.
Thallogens are variously divided by different writers, and the places
for diatoms, slime molds, and stoneworts are altogether uncertain.

ocis, swift, quick; perhaps akin to v to fly (see Volatile): cf. F.

1. Quickness of motion; swiftness; speed; celerity; rapidity; as, the
velocity of wind; the velocity of a planet or comet in its orbit or
course; the velocity of a cannon ball; the velocity of light.

Note: In such phrases, velocity is more generally used than celerity.
We apply celerity to animals; as, a horse or an ostrich runs with
celerity; but bodies moving in the air or in ethereal space move with
greater or less velocity, not celerity. This usage is arbitrary, and
perhaps not universal.

2. (Mech.)

Defn: Rate of motion; the relation of motion to time, measured by the
number of units of space passed over by a moving body or point in a
unit of time, usually the number of feet passed over in a second. See
the Note under Speed. Angular velocity. See under Angular.
 -- Initial velocity, the velocity of a moving body at starting;
especially, the velocity of a projectile as it leaves the mouth of a
firearm from which it is discharged.
 -- Relative velocity, the velocity with which a body approaches or
recedes from another body, whether both are moving or only one.
 -- Uniform velocity, velocity in which the same number of units of
space are described in each successive unit of time.
 -- Variable velocity, velocity in which the space described varies
from instant, either increasing or decreasing; -- in the former case
called accelerated velocity, in the latter, retarded velocity; the
acceleration or retardation itself being also either uniform or
variable.
 -- Virtual velocity. See under Virtual.

Note: In variable velocity, the velocity, strictly, at any given
instant, is the rate of motion at that instant, and is expressed by
the units of space, which, if the velocity at that instant were
continued uniform during a unit of time, would be described in the
unit of time; thus, the velocity of a falling body at a given instant
is the number of feet which, if the motion which the body has at that
instant were continued uniformly for one second, it would pass
through in the second. The scientific sense of velocity differs from
the popular sense in being applied to all rates of motion, however
slow, while the latter implies more or less rapidity or quickness of
motion.

Syn.
 -- Swiftness; celerity; rapidity; fleetness; speed.

Ver"te*bra, n.; pl. Vertebr?. Etym: [L. vertebra, fr. vertere to
turn, change. See Verse.]

1. (Anat.)

Defn: One of the serial segments of the spinal column.

Note: In many fishes the vertebr? are simple cartilaginous disks or
short cylinders, but in the higher vertebrates they are composed of
many parts, and the vertebr? in different portions of the same column
vary very greatly. A well-developed vertebra usually consists of a
more or less cylindrical and solid body, or centrum, which is
surmounted dorsally by an arch, leaving an opening which forms a part
of the canal containing the spinal cord. From this dorsal, or neural,
arch spring various processes, or apophyses, which have received
special names: a dorsal, or neural, spine, spinous process, or
neurapophysis, on the middle of the arch; two anterior and two
posterior articular processes, or zygapophyses; and one or two
transverse processes on each side. In those vertebr? which bear well-
developed ribs, a tubercle near the end of the rib articulates at a
tubercular facet on the transverse process (diapophysis), while the
end, or head, of the rib articulates at a more ventral capitular
facet which is sometimes developed into a second, or ventral,
transverse process (parapophysis). In vertebrates with well-developed
hind limbs, the spinal column is divided into five regions in each of
which the vertebr? are specially designated: those vertebr? in front
of, or anterior to, the first vertebra which bears ribs connected
with the sternum are cervical; all those which bear ribs and are back
of the cervicals are dorsal; the one or more directly supporting the
pelvis are sacral and form the sacrum; those between the sacral and
dorsal are lumbar; and all those back of the sacral are caudal, or
coccygeal. In man there are seven cervical vertebr?, twelve dorsal,
five lumbar, five sacral, and usually four, but sometimes five and
rarely three, coccygeal.

2. (Phon.)

Defn: Sound of the kind or quality heard in speech or song in the
consonants b, v, d, etc., and in the vowels; sonant, or intonated,
utterance; tone; -- distinguished from mere breath sound as heard in
f, s, sh, etc., and also whisper.

Note: Voice, in this sense, is produced by vibration of the so-called
vocal cords in the larynx (see Illust. of Larynx) which act upon the
air, not in the manner of the strings of a stringed instrument, but
as a pair of membranous tongues, or reeds, which, being continually
forced apart by the outgoing current of breath, and continually
brought together again by their own elasticity and muscular tension,
break the breath current into a series of puffs, or pulses,
sufficiently rapid to cause the sensation of tone. The power, or
loudness, of such a tone depends on the force of the separate pulses,
and this is determined by the pressure of the expired air, together
with the resistance on the part of the vocal cords which is
continually overcome. Its pitch depends on the number of aerial
pulses within a given time, that is, on the rapidity of their
succession. See Guide to Pronunciation,  5, 146, 155.

scientific, term for the same state of the will; viz., an "elective

choice, that act is called an emanent, or executive, or imperative,
volition. When an immanent, or settled state of, choice, is one which

sought for by the governing or "predominant volition." See Will.

What see'st thou in the ground Shak.
What is man, that thou art mindful of him Ps. viii. 4.
What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!
Matt. viii. 27.

Note: Originally, what, when, where, which, who, why, etc., were
interrogatives only, and it is often difficult to determine whether
they are used as interrogatives or relatives. What in this sense,
when it refers to things, may be used either substantively or
adjectively; when it refers to persons, it is used only adjectively
with a noun expressed, who being the pronoun used substantively.

2. As an exclamatory word: -- (a) Used absolutely or independently; -
- often with a question following. "What welcome be thou." Chaucer.
What, could ye not watch with me one hour Matt. xxvi. 40.

(b) Used adjectively, meaning how remarkable, or how great; as, what

Note: In such phrases as I tell you what, what anticipates the
following statement, being elliptical for what I think, what it is,
how it is, etc. "I tell thee what, corporal Bardolph, I could tear
her." Shak. Here what relates to the last clause, "I could tear her;"
this is what I tell you. What not is often used at the close of an
enumeration of several particulars or articles, it being an
abbreviated clause, the verb of which, being either the same as that
of the principal clause or a general word, as be, say, mention,
enumerate, etc., is omitted. "Men hunt, hawk, and what not." Becon.
"Some dead puppy, or log, orwhat not." C. Kingsley. "Battles,
tournaments, hunts, and what not." De Quincey. Hence, the words are
often used in a general sense with the force of a substantive,
equivalent to anything you please, a miscellany, a variety, etc. From
this arises the name whatnot, applied to an etagere, as being a piece
of furniture intended for receiving miscellaneous articles of use or
ornament. But what is used for but that, usually after a negative,
and excludes everything contrary to the assertion in the following
sentence. "Her needle is not so absolutely perfect in tent and cross
stitch but what my superintendence is advisable." Sir W. Scott.
"Never fear but what our kite shall fly as high." Ld. Lytton. What
ho! an exclamation of calling.

etc., often with the implication that it is of no consequence. "All
this is so; but what of this, my lord" Shak. "The night is spent,
why, what of that" Shak.
 -- What though, even granting that; allowing that; supposing it true
that. "What though the rose have prickles, yet't is plucked." Shak.

limbs in those places, sometimes finishing by two or three blows on
the chest or stomach, which usually put an end to the life of the
criminal, and were hence called coups-de-grace -- blows of mercy. The

willeo, willio, D. wil, G. wille, Icel. vili, Dan. villie, Sw. vilja,
Goth wilja. See Will, v.]

1. The power of choosing; the faculty or endowment of the soul by
which it is capable of choosing; the faculty or power of the mind by
which we decide to do or not to do; the power or faculty of
preferring or selecting one of two or more objects.
It is necessary to form a distinct notion of what is meant by the
word "volition" in order to understand the import of the word will,
for this last word expresses the power of mind of which "volition" is
the act. Stewart.
Will is an ambiguous word, being sometimes put for the faculty of
willing; sometimes for the act of that faculty, besides [having]
other meanings. But "volition" always signifies the act of willing,
and nothing else. Reid.
Appetite is the will's solicitor, and the will is appetite's
controller; what we covet according to the one, by the other we often
reject. Hooker.
The will is plainly that by which the mind chooses anything. J.
Edwards.

2. The choice which is made; a determination or preference which
results from the act or exercise of the power of choice; a volition.
The word "will," however, is not always used in this its proper
acceptation, but is frequently substituted for "volition", as when I
say that my hand mover in obedience to my will. Stewart.

3. The choice or determination of one who has authority; a decree; a
command; discretionary pleasure.
Thy will be done. Matt. vi. 10.
Our prayers should be according to the will of God. Law.

4. Strong wish or inclination; desire; purpose.

Note: "Inclination is another word with which will is frequently
confounded. Thus, when the apothecary says, in Romeo and Juliet, --
My poverty, but not my will, consents; . . . Put this in any liquid
thing you will, And drink it off. the word will is plainly used as,
synonymous with inclination; not in the strict logical sense, as the
immediate antecedent of action. It is with the same latitude that the
word is used in common conversation, when we speak of doing a thing
which duty prescribes, against one's own will; or when we speak of
doing a thing willingly or unwillingly." Stewart.

5. That which is strongly wished or desired.
What's your will, good friar Shak.
The mariner hath his will. Coleridge.

6. Arbitrary disposal; power to control, dispose, or determine.
Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies. Ps. xxvii. 12.

7

Defn: The legal declaration of a person's mind as to the manner in
which he would have his property or estate disposed of after his
death; the written instrument, legally executed, by which a man makes
disposition of his estate, to take effect after his death; testament;
devise. See the Note under Testament, 1.

Note: Wills are written or nuncupative, that is, oral. See
Nuncupative will, under Nuncupative. At will (Law), at pleasure. To
hold an estate at the will of another, is to enjoy the possession at
his pleasure, and be liable to be ousted at any time by the lessor or
proprietor. An estate at will is at the will of both parties.
 -- Good will. See under Good.
 -- Ill will, enmity; unfriendliness; malevolence.
 -- To have one's will, to obtain what is desired; to do what one
pleases.
 -- Will worship, worship according to the dictates of the will or
fancy; formal worship. [Obs.] -- Will worshiper, one who offers will
worship. [Obs.] Jer. Taylor.
 -- With a will, with willingness and zeal; with all one's heart or
strength; earnestly; heartily.

WILL
Will, v. t. & auxiliary. [imp. Would. Indic. present, I will (Obs. I
wol), thou wilt, he will (Obs. he wol); we, ye, they will.] Etym:
[OE. willen, imp. wolde; akin to OS. willan, OFries. willa, D.
willen, G. wollen, OHG. wollan, wellan, Icel. & Sw. vilja, Dan.
ville, Goth. wiljan, OSlav. voliti, L. velle to wish, volo I wish;
cf. Skr. vrs to choose, to prefer. Cf. Voluntary, Welcome, Well,
adv.]

1. To wish; to desire; to incline to have.
A wife as of herself no thing ne sholde [should] Wille in effect, but
as her husband wolde [would]. Chaucer.
Caleb said unto her, What will thou Judg. i. 14.
They would none of my counsel. Prov. i. 30.

2. As an auxiliary, will is used to denote futurity dependent on the
verb. Thus, in first person, "I will" denotes willingness, consent,
promise; and when "will" is emphasized, it denotes determination or
fixed purpose; as, I will go if you wish; I will go at all hazards.
In the second and third persons, the idea of distinct volition, wish,
or purpose is evanescent, and simple certainty is appropriately
expressed; as, "You will go," or "He will go," describes a future
event as a fact only. To emphasize will denotes (according to the
tone or context) certain futurity or fixed determination.

Note: Will, auxiliary, may be used elliptically for will go. "I'll to
her lodgings." Marlowe.

Note: As in shall (which see), the second and third persons may be
virtually converted into the first, either by question or indirect
statement, so as to receive the meaning which belongs to will in that
person; thus, "Will you go" (answer, "I will go") asks assent,
requests, etc.; while "Will he go" simply inquires concerning
futurity; thus, also,"He says or thinks he will go," "You say or
think you will go," both signify willingness or consent.

Note: Would, as the preterit of will, is chiefly employed in
conditional, subjunctive, or optative senses; as, he would go if he
could; he could go if he would; he said that he would go; I would
fain go, but can not; I would that I were young again; and other like
phrases. In the last use, the first personal pronoun is often
omitted; as, would that he were here; would to Heaven that it were
so; and, omitting the to in such an adjuration. "Would God I had died
for thee." Would is used for both present and future time, in
conditional propositions, and would have for past time; as, he would
go now if he were ready; if it should rain, he would not go; he would
have gone, had he been able. Would not, as also will not, signifies
refusal. "He was angry, and would not go in." Luke xv. 28. Would is
never a past participle.

Note: In Ireland, Scotland, and the United States, especially in the
southern and western portions of the United States, shall and will,
should and would, are often misused, as in the following examples: --
I am able to devote as much time and attention to other subjects as I
will [shall] be under the necessity of doing next winter. Chalmers.
A countryman, telling us what he had seen, remarked that if the

and judgment; discretion; sagacity; skill; dexterity.

of the spirit. Wyclif (1 Cor. ii. 13).
Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil
is understanding. Job xxviii. 28.

Syn.
 -- Prudence; knowledge. Wisdom, Prudence, Knowledge. Wisdom has been
defined to be "the use of the best means for attaining the best
ends." "We conceive," says Whewell, " prudence as the virtue by which
we select right means for given ends, while wisdom implies the
selection of right ends as well as of right means." Hence, wisdom
implies the union of high mental and moral excellence. Prudence (that
is, providence, or forecast) is of a more negative character; it
rather consists in avoiding danger than in taking decisive measures
for the accomplishment of an object. Sir Robert Walpole was in many
respects a prudent statesman, but he was far from being a wise one.
Burke has said that prudence, when carried too far, degenerates into
a "reptile virtue," which is the more dangerous for its plausible
appearance. Knowledge, a more comprehensive term, signifies the
simple apprehension of facts or relations. "In strictness of
language," says Paley, " there is a difference between knowledge and
wisdom; wisdom always supposing action, and action directed by it."
Knowledge and wisdom, far from being one, Have ofttimes no
connection. Knowledge dwells In heads replete with thoughts of other
men; Wisdom, in minds attentive to their own. Knowledge, a rude,
unprofitable mass, The mere materials with which wisdom builds, Till
smoothed, and squared, and fitted to its place, Does but encumber
whom it seems to enrich. Knowledge is proud that he has learned so
much; Wisdom is humble that he knows no more. Cowper.
Wisdom tooth, the last, or back, tooth of the full set on each half
of each jaw in man; -- familiarly so called, because appearing
comparatively late, after the person may be supposed to have arrived
at the age of wisdom. See the Note under Tooth, 1.

WIT
Wit, n. Etym: [AS. witt, wit; akin to OFries. wit, G. witz, OHG.

xi. 34).

from serving thee. Shak.

Syn.
 -- Ingenuity; humor; satire; sarcasm; irony; burlesque.
 -- Wit, Humor. Wit primarily meant mind; and now denotes the power
of seizing on some thought or occurrence, and, by a sudden turn,
presenting it under aspects wholly new and unexpected -- apparently
natural and admissible, if not perfectly just, and bearing on the
subject, or the parties concerned, with a laughable keenness and
force. "What I want," said a pompous orator, aiming at his
antagonist, "is common sense." "Exactly!" was the whispered reply.
The pleasure we find in wit arises from the ingenuity of the turn,
the sudden surprise it brings, and the patness of its application to
the case, in the new and ludicrous relations thus flashed upon the
view. Humor is a quality more congenial to the English mind than wit.
It consists primarily in taking up the peculiarities of a humorist
(or eccentric person) and drawing them out, as Addison did those of
Sir Roger de Coverley, so that we enjoy a hearty, good-natured laugh
at his unconscious manifestation of whims and oddities. From this
original sense the term has been widened to embrace other sources of
kindly mirth of the same general character. In a well-known
caricature of English reserve, an Oxford student is represented as
standing on the brink of a river, greatly agitated at the sight of a
drowning man before him, and crying out, "O that I had been
introduced to this gentleman, that I might save his life! The,
"Silent Woman" of Ben Jonson is one of the most humorous productions,
in the original sense of the term, which we have in our language.

Note: Walker condemns the pronunciation woond as a "capricious

language, namely, that the Old English long sound written ou, and
pronounced like French ou or modern English oo, has regularly
changed, when accented, into the diphthongal sound usually written
with the same letters ou in modern English, as in ground, hound,
round, sound. The use of ou in Old English to represent the sound of
modern English oo was borrowed from the French, and replaced the
older and Anglo-Saxon spelling with u. It makes no difference whether
the word was taken from the French or not, provided it is old enough
in English to have suffered this change to what is now the common
sound of ou; but words taken from the French at a later time, or
influenced by French, may have the French sound. Wound gall (Zool.),
an elongated swollen or tuberous gall on the branches of the

Defn: Act of one who wrestles; specif., the sport consisting of the
hand-to-hand combat between two unarmed contestants who seek to throw
each other. The various styles of wrestling differ in their
definition of a fall and in the governing rules. In Greco-Roman
wrestling, tripping and taking hold of the legs are forbidden, and a
fall is gained (that is, the bout is won), by the contestant who pins
both his opponent's shoulders to the ground. In catch-as-catch-can
wrestling, all holds are permitted except such as may be barred by
mutual consent, and a fall is defined as in Greco-Roman style.
Lancashire style wrestling is essentially the same as catch-as-catch-
can. In Cumberland and Westmorland wrestling the contestants stand
chest to chest, grasping each other around the body. The one first
losing his hold, or touching the ground with any part of his body
except his feet, loses the bout. If both fall to the ground at the
same time, it is a dogfall, and must be wrestled over. In the
Cornwall and Devon wrestling, the wrestlers complete in strong loose
linen jackets, catching hold of the jacket, or anywhere above the
waist. Two shoulders and one hip, or two hips and one shoulder, must
touch the ground to constitute a fall, and if a man is thrown
otherwise than on his back the contestants get upon their feet and
the bout recommences.
