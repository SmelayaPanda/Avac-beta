Defn: Unreasonable contempt of danger; extreme venturesomeness;
rashness; as, the temerity of a commander in war.

Syn.
 -- Rashness; precipitancy; heedlessness; venturesomeness.
 -- Temerity, Rashness. These words are closely allied in sense, but
have a slight difference in their use and application. Temerity is
Latin, and rashness is Anglo-Saxon. As in many such cases, the Latin
term is more select and dignified; the Anglo-Saxon more familiar and
energetic. We show temerity in hasty decisions, and the conduct to
which they lead. We show rashness in particular actions, as dictated
by sudden impulse. It is an exhibition of temerity to approach the
verge of a precipice; it is an act of rashness to jump into a river
without being able to swim. Temerity, then, is an unreasonable
contempt of danger; rashness is a rushing into danger from
thoughtlessness or excited feeling.
It is notorious temerity to pass sentence upon grounds uncapable of
evidence. Barrow.
Her rush hand in evil hour Forth reaching to the fruit, she plucked,
she eat. Milton.

6. (Logic)

Defn: The subject or the predicate of a proposition; one of the three
component parts of a syllogism, each one of which is used twice.
The subject and predicate of a proposition are, after Aristotle,
together called its terms or extremes. Sir W. Hamilton.

Note: The predicate of the conclusion is called the major term,
because it is the most general, and the subject of the conclusion is
called the minor term, because it is less general. These are called
the extermes; and the third term, introduced as a common measure
between them, is called the mean or middle term. Thus in the
following syllogism, --Every vegetable is combustible; Every tree is
a vegetable; Therefore every tree is combustible, -combustible, the
predicate of the conclusion, is the major term; tree is the minor
term; vegetable is the middle term.

7. A word or expression; specifically, one that has a precisely

Syn.
 -- Limit; bound; boundary; condition; stipulation; word; expression.
 -- Term, Word. These are more frequently interchanged than almost
any other vocables that occur of the language. There is, however, a
difference between them which is worthy of being kept in mind. Word
is generic; it denotes an utterance which represents or expresses our
thoughts and feelings. Term originally denoted one of the two
essential members of a proposition in logic, and hence signifies a
word of specific meaning, and applicable to a definite class of
objects. Thus, we may speak of a scientific or a technical term, and
of stating things in distinct terms. Thus we say, "the term minister
literally denotes servant;" "an exact definition of terms is
essential to clearness of thought;" "no term of reproach can
sufficiently express my indignation;" "every art has its peculiar and
distinctive terms," etc. So also we say, "purity of style depends on
the choice of words, and precision of style on a clear understanding
of the terms used." Term is chiefly applied to verbs, nouns, and
adjectives, these being capable of standing as terms in a logical
proposition; while prepositions and conjunctions, which can never be
so employed, are rarely spoken of as terms, but simply as words.

Syn.
 -- Criterion; standard; experience; proof; experiment; trial.
 -- Test, Trial. Trial is the wider term; test is a searching and
decisive trial. It is derived from the Latin testa (earthen pot),
which term was early applied to the fining pot, or crucible, in which
metals are melted for trial and refinement. Hence the peculiar force
of the word, as indicating a trial or criterion of the most decisive
kind.
I leave him to your gracious acceptance, whose trial shall better
publish his commediation. Shak.
Thy virtue, prince, has stood the test of fortune, Like purest gold,
that tortured in the furnace, Comes out more bright, and brings forth

Syn.
 -- Proof; evidence; attestation; witness; affirmation; confirmation;

used more frequently (though not exclusively) of facts and things
which occur in the ordinary concerns of life. Evidence is a word of
more dignity, and is more generally applied to that which is moral or
intellectual; as, the evidences of Christianity, etc. Testimony is
what is deposed to by a witness on oath or affirmation. When used

reference to some living agent as its author, as when we speak of the
testimony of conscience, or of doing a thing in testimony of our
affection, etc. Testimony refers rather to the thing declared,
evidence to its value or effect. "To conform our language more to
common use, we ought to divide arguments into demonstrations, proofs,
and probabilities; ba proofs, meaning such arguments from experience
as leave no room for doubt or opposition." Hume. "The evidence of
sense is the first and highest kind of evidence of which human nature
is capable." Bp. Wilkins. "The proof of everything must be by the
testimony of such as the parties produce." Spenser.

sing. of the article (originally a demonstrative pronoun). The nom.

th\'91t is akin to D. dat, G. das, OHG. daz, Sw. & Dan. det, Icel.
?at (masc. sa, fem. so), Goth. ?ata (masc. sa, fem. so), Gr. tat (for
tad, masc. sas, fem. sa); cf. L. istud that. *184. Cf. The, Their,
They, Them, This, Than, Since.]

1. As a demonstrative pronoun (pl. Those), that usually points out,
or refers to, a person or thing previously mentioned, or supposed to
be understood. That, as a demonstrative, may precede the noun to
which it refers; as, that which he has said is true; those in the
basket are good apples.

princes. Gibbon.

with the wicked. Gen. xviii. 25.

Note: That is often used in opposition to this, or by way of
distinction, and in such cases this, like the Latin hic and French
ceci, generally refers to that which is nearer, and that, like Latin
ille and French cela, to that which is more remote. When they refer
to foreign words or phrases, this generally refers to the latter, and
that to the former.
Two principles in human nature reign; Self-love, to urge, and Reason,
to restrain; Nor this a good, nor that a bad we call. Pope.
If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this or that. James iv. 16.

that other not. Chaucer.

to point out, and make definite, a person or thing spoken of, or
alluded to, before, and may be either singular or plural.
He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame. Prov. ix. 7.
A judgment that is equal and impartial must incline to the greater
probabilities. Bp. Wilkins.

Note: If the relative clause simply conveys an additional idea, and
is not properly explanatory or restrictive, who or which (rarely
that) is employed; as, the king that (or who) rules well is generally
popular; Victoria, who (not that) rules well, enjoys the confidence
of her subjects. Ambiguity may in some cases be avoided in the use of
that (which is restrictive) instead of who or which, likely to be
understood in a coordinating sense. Bain. That was formerly used for
that which, as what is now; but such use is now archaic.
We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen. John iii.
11.

which it commences.

him, etc., and the two together had the force of a relative pronoun;
thus, that he = who; that his = whose; that him = whom.

him wirche [work]. Chaucer.
Formerly, that was used, where we now commonly use which, as a

antecedent.

cut off. Zech. xi. 9.

demonstrative pronoun. It is used, specifically: --

verb, or as the subject or predicate nominative of a verb.
She tells them 't is a causeless fantasy, And childish error, that
they are afraid. Shak.

(c) To introduce a purpose; -- usually followed by may, or might, and
frequently preceded by so, in order, to the end, etc.

conjunction on which it depends.

2. The alternate rising and falling of the waters of the ocean, and
of bays, rivers, etc., connected therewith. The tide ebbs and flows
twice in each lunar day, or the space of a little more than twenty-
four hours. It is occasioned by the attraction of the sun and moon
(the influence of the latter being three times that of the former),
acting unequally on the waters in different parts of the earth, thus
disturbing their equilibrium. A high tide upon one side of the earth
is accompanied by a high tide upon the opposite side. Hence, when the
sun and moon are in conjunction or opposition, as at new moon and
full moon, their action is such as to produce a greater than the
usual tide, called the spring tide, as represented in the cut. When
the moon is in the first or third quarter, the sun's attraction in
part counteracts the effect of the moon's attraction, thus producing
under the moon a smaller tide than usual, called the neap tide.

Note: The flow or rising of the water is called flood tide, and the
reflux, ebb tide.

3. A stream; current; flood; as, a tide of blood. "Let in the tide of
knaves once more; my cook and I'll provide." Shak.

 -- Tide day, the interval between the occurrences of two consecutive
maxima of the resultant wave at the same place. Its length varies as
the components of sun and moon waves approach to, or recede from, one
another. A retardation from this cause is called the lagging of the
tide, while the acceleration of the recurrence of high water is
termed the priming of the tide. See Lag of the tide, under 2d Lag.
 -- Tide dial, a dial to exhibit the state of the tides at any time.
 -- Tide gate. (a) An opening through which water may flow freely

To- (, see To, prep.) Etym: [AS. to- asunder; akin to G. zer-, and
perhaps to L. dis-, or Gr.

Defn: An obsolete intensive prefix used in the formation of compound
verbs; as in to-beat, to-break, to-hew, to-rend, to-tear. See these
words in the Vocabulary. See the Note on All to, or All-to, under
All, adv.

TO
To (emphatic or alone, obscure or unemphatic), prep. Etym: [AS. to;
akin to OS. & OFries. to, D. toe, G. zu, OHG. zuo, zua, zo, Russ. do,
Ir. & Gael. do, OL. -do, -du, as in endo, indu, in, Gr. Too, Tatoo a
beat of drums.]

1. The preposition to primarily indicates approach and arrival,
motion made in the direction of a place or thing and attaining it,
access; and also, motion or tendency without arrival; movement
toward; -- opposed to Ant: from. "To Canterbury they wend." Chaucer.
Stay with us, go not to Wittenberg. Shak.
So to the sylvan lodge They came, that like Pomona's arbor smiled.
Milton.
I'll to him again, . . . He'll tell me all his purpose. She stretched
her arms to heaven. Dryden.

2. Hence, it indicates motion, course, or tendency toward a time, a
state or condition, an aim, or anything capable of being regarded as
a limit to a tendency, movement, or action; as, he is going to a
trade; he is rising to wealth and honor.

Note: Formerly, by omission of the verb denoting motion, to sometimes
followed a form of be, with the sense of at, or in. "When the sun was
[gone or declined] to rest." Chaucer.

3. In a very general way, and with innumerable varieties of
application, to connects transitive verbs with their remoter or
indirect object, and adjectives, nouns, and neuter or passive verbs
with a following noun which limits their action. Its sphere verges
upon that of for, but it contains less the idea of design or
appropriation; as, these remarks were addressed to a large audience;
let us keep this seat to ourselves; a substance sweet to the taste;
an event painful to the mind; duty to God and to our parents; a
dislike to spirituous liquor.
Marks and points out each man of us to slaughter. B. Jonson.
Whilst they, distilled Almost to jelly with the act of fear, Stand
dumb and speak not to him. Shak.
Add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge; and to knowledge
temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;
and to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness
charity. 2 Pet. i. 5,6,7.
I have a king's oath to the contrary. Shak.
Numbers were crowded to death. Clarendon.
Fate and the dooming gods are deaf to tears. Dryden.
Go, buckle to the law. Dryden.

4. As sign of the infinitive, to had originally the use of last
defined, governing the infinitive as a verbal noun, and connecting it
as indirect object with a preceding verb or adjective; thus, ready to
go, i.e., ready unto going; good to eat, i.e., good for eating; I do
my utmost to lead my life pleasantly. But it has come to be the
almost constant prefix to the infinitive, even in situations where it
has no prepositional meaning, as where the infinitive is direct
object or subject; thus, I love to learn, i.e., I love learning; to
die for one's country is noble, i.e., the dying for one's country.
Where the infinitive denotes the design or purpose, good usage
formerly allowed the prefixing of for to the to; as, what went ye out
for see (Matt. xi. 8).
Then longen folk to go on pilgrimages, And palmers for to seeken
strange stranders. Chaucer.

Note: Such usage is now obsolete or illiterate. In colloquial usage,
to often stands for, and supplies, an infinitive already mentioned;
thus, he commands me to go with him, but I do not wish to.

5. In many phrases, and in connection with many other words, to has a
pregnant meaning, or is used elliptically. Thus, it denotes or
implies:
(a) Extent; limit; degree of comprehension; inclusion as far as; as,
they met us to the number of three hundred.
We ready are to try our fortunes To the last man. Shak.
Few of the Esquimaux can count to ten. Quant. Rev.

(b) Effect; end; consequence; as, the prince was flattered to his
ruin; he engaged in a war to his cost; violent factions exist to the
prejudice of the state.
(c) Apposition; connection; antithesis; opposition; as, they engaged
hand to hand.
Now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face. 1 Cor.
xiii. 12.

(d) Accord; adaptation; as, an occupation to his taste; she has a
husband to her mind.
He to God's image, she to his was made. Dryden.

(e) Comparison; as, three is to nine as nine is to twenty-seven; it
is ten to one that you will offend him.
All that they did was piety to this. B. Jonson.

(f) Addition; union; accumulation.
Wisdom he has, and to his wisdom, courage. Denham.

(g) Accompaniment; as, she sang to his guitar; they danced to the
music of a piano.
Anon they move In perfect phalanx to the Dorian mood Of flutes and
soft recorders. Milton.

(h) Character; condition of being; purpose subserved or office
filled. [In this sense archaic] "I have a king here to my flatterer."
Shak.
Made his masters and others . . . to consider him to a little wonder.
Walton.

Note: To in to-day, to-night, and to-morrow has the sense or force of
for or on; for, or on, (this) day, for, or on, (this) night, for, or
on, (the) morrow. To-day, to-night, to-morrow may be considered as
compounds, and usually as adverbs; but they are sometimes used as
nouns; as, to-day is ours.
To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow; Creeps in this petty pace
from day to day. Shak.
To and again, to and fro. [R.] -- To and fro, forward and back. In
this phrase, to is adverbial.
There was great showing both to and fro. Chaucer.
-- To-and-fro, a pacing backward and forward; as, to commence a to-
and-fro. Tennyson.
 -- To the face, in front of; in behind; hence, in the presence of.
 -- To wit, to know; namely. See Wit, v. i.

Note: To, without an object expressed, is used adverbially; as, put
to the door, i. e., put the door to its frame, close it; and in the
nautical expressions, to heave to, to come to, meaning to a certain
position. To, like on, is sometimes used as a command, forward, set
to. "To, Achilles! to, Ajax! to!" Shak.

Note: The use of the word tone, both for a sound and for the interval
between two sounds or tones, is confusing, but is common -- almost
universal.

Note: Nearly every musical sound is composite, consisting of several
simultaneous tones having different rates of vibration according to
fixed laws, which depend upon the nature of the vibrating body and
the mode of excitation. The components (of a composite sound) are
called partial tones; that one having the lowest rate of vibration is
the fundamental tone, and the other partial tones are called
harmonics, or overtones. The vibration ratios of the partial tones
composing any sound are expressed by all, or by a part, of the
numbers in the series 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.; and the quality of any
sound (the tone color) is due in part to the presence or absence of
overtones as represented in this series, and in part to the greater
or less intensity of those present as compared with the fundamental
tone and with one another. Resultant tones, combination tones,
summation tones, difference tones, Tartini's tones (terms only in
part synonymous) are produced by the simultaneous sounding of two or
more primary (simple or composite) tones.

is either foreign or domestic. Foreign trade consists in the

exchange, or buying and selling, of goods within a country. Trade is
also by the wholesale, that is, by the package or in large

Note: The general direction of the trade winds is from N. E. to S. W.
on the north side of the equator, and from S. E. to N. W. on the
south side of the equator. They are produced by the joint effect of
the rotation of the earth and the movement of the air from the polar
toward the equatorial regions, to supply the vacancy caused by
heating, rarefaction, and consequent ascent of the air in the latter
regions. The trade winds are principally limited to two belts in the
tropical regions, one on each side of the equator, and separated by a
belt which is characterized by calms or variable weather.

Defn: In the Kantian system, of or pertaining to that which can be

is acquired by experience.

Syn.
 -- Transcendental, Empirical. These terms, with the corresponding
nouns, transcendentalism and empiricism, are of comparatively recent
origin. Empirical refers to knowledge which is gained by the
experience of actual phenomena, without reference to the principles
or laws to which they are to be referred, or by which they are to be
explained. Transcendental has reference to those beliefs or
principles which are not derived from experience, and yet are
absolutely necessary to make experience possible or useful. Such, in
the better sense of the term, is the transcendental philosophy, or
transcendentalism. Each of these words is also used in a bad sense,
empiricism applying to that one-sided view of knowledge which
neglects or loses sight of the truths or principles referred to
above, and trusts to experience alone; transcendentalism, to the
opposite extreme, which, in its deprecation of experience, loses
sight of the relations which facts and phenomena sustain to
principles, and hence to a kind of philosophy, or a use of language,
which is vague, obscure, fantastic, or extravagant.

TRANSCENDENTAL
Tran`scen*den"tal, n.

Defn: A transcendentalist. [Obs.]

transcendentalismus.]

1. (Kantian Philos.)

Defn: The transcending, or going beyond, empiricism, and ascertaining
a priori the fundamental principles of human knowledge.

Note: As Schelling and Hegel claim to have discovered the absolute
identity of the objective and subjective in human knowledge, or of
things and human conceptions of them, the Kantian distinction between
transcendent and transcendental ideas can have no place in their
philosophy; and hence, with them, transcendentalism claims to have a
true knowledge of all things, material and immaterial, human and
divine, so far as the mind is capable of knowing them. And in this
sense the word transcendentalism is now most used. It is also
sometimes used for that which is vague and illusive in philosophy.

2. Ambitious and imaginative vagueness in thought, imagery, or
diction.

type bodies (Type Founding), a system adopted by the type founders of
the United States by which the various sizes of type have been so
modified and changed that each size bears an exact proportional
relation to every other size. The system is a modification of a
French system, and is based on the pica body. This pica body is
divided into twelfths, which are termed "points," and every type body
consist of a given number of these points. Many of the type founders
indicate the new sizes of type by the number of points, and the old
names are gradually being done away with. By the point system type
founders cast type of a uniform size and height, whereas formerly
fonts of pica or other type made by different founders would often
vary slightly so that they could not be used together. There are no
type in actual use corresponding to the smaller theoretical sizes of
the point system. In some cases, as in that of ruby, the term used
designates a different size from that heretofore so called.

See Anti-.]

Defn: An inseparable verbal prefix or particle. It is prefixed: (a)
To verbs to express the contrary, and not the simple negative, of the
action of the verb to which it is prefixed; as in uncoil, undo,
unfold. (b) To nouns to form verbs expressing privation of the thing,
quality, or state expressed by the noun, or separation from it; as in
unchild, unsex. Sometimes particles and participial adjectives formed
with this prefix coincide in form with compounds of the negative
prefix un- (see 2d Un-); as in undone (from undo), meaning
unfastened, ruined; and undone (from 2d un- and done) meaning not
done, not finished. Un- is sometimes used with an intensive force
merely; as in unloose.

Note: Compounds of this prefix are given in full in their proper
order in the Vocabulary.

UN-
Un-. Etym: [OE. & AS. un-; akin to OFries. un-, D. on-, OS., OHG., &
G. un-, Icel. o-, u-, Sw. o-, Dan. u-, W. an-, L. in-, Gr. an-, a-.
*193. Cf. A- not In- not, No, adv.]

Defn: An inseparable prefix, or particle, signifying not; in-; non-.
In- is prefixed mostly to words of Latin origin, or else to words
formed by Latin suffixes; un- is of much wider application, and is
attached at will to almost any adjective, or participle used
adjectively, or adverb, from which it may be desired to form a
corresponding negative adjective or adverb, and is also, but less
freely, prefixed to nouns. Un- sometimes has merely an intensive
force; as in unmerciless, unremorseless. I.

Defn: Un- is prefixed to adjectives, or to words used adjectively.
Specifically: --
(a) To adjectives, to denote the absence of the quality designated by
the adjective; as, ------ and the like.

(b) To past particles, or to adjectives formed after the analogy of
past particles, to indicate the absence of the condition or state
expressed by them; as, -Unabolishable Unabsolvable Unabsurd
Unabundant Unaccordant Unadoptable Unadventurous Unaffable
Unaffectionate Unafraid Unalliable Unallowablew Unalterable
Unambiguous Unambitious Unamendable Un-American Unamusive Unangular

Unapplausive Unappreciable Unapprehensible Unapprehensive
Unapproachable Unartificial Unartistic Unassailable Unattainable

Unbribable Unbrotherly Unburdensome Unbusinesslike Unbusy Uncandid
Uncanonical Uncaptious Uncareful Uncelestial Unceremonious
Unchallengeable Unchangeable Unchary Unchastisable Uncheerful

---- and the like.

(c) To present particles which come from intransitive verbs, or are
themselves employed as adjectives, to mark the absence of the
activity, disposition, or condition implied by the participle; as, --
--- and the like.

Note: The above classes of words are unlimited in extent, and such
compounds may be formed by any writer or speaker at will from almost
all the adjectives or participles in the language, excepting those
which have a recognized and usual negative correspondent with the
prefix -in. No attempt will be made, therefore, to define them all in
this Dictionary; many will be omitted from its Vocabulary which are
negations of the simple word, and are readily explained by prefixing
a not to the latter. Derivatives of these words in -ly and -ness will
also, for the most part, be omitted for the same or similar reasons.
There will be inserted as separate articles with definitions, the
following: --1. Those which have acquired an opposed or contrary,
instead of a merely negative, meaning; as, unfriendly, ungraceful,
unpalatable, unquiet, and the like; or else an intensive sense more
than a prefixed not would express; as, unending, unparalleled,
undisciplined, undoubted, unsafe, and the like. 2. Those which have
the value of independent words, inasmuch as the simple words are
either not used at all, or are rarely, or at least much less
frequently, used; as, unavoidable, unconscionable, undeniable,
unspeakable, unprecedented, unruly, and the like; or inasmuch as they
are used in a different sense from the usual meaning of the
primitive, or especially in one of the significations of the latter;
as, unaccountable, unalloyed, unbelieving, unpretending, unreserved,
and the like; or inasmuch as they are so frequently and familiarly
used that they are hardly felt to be of negative origin; as,
uncertain, uneven, and the like. 3. Those which are anomalous,
provincial, or, for some other reason, not desirable to be used, and
are so indicated; as, unpure for impure, unsatisfaction for
dissatisfaction, unexpressible for inexpressible, and the like. II.

Defn: Un- is prefixed to nouns to express the absence of, or the
contrary of, that which the noun signifies; as, unbelief, unfaith,
unhealth, unrest, untruth, and the like.

Note: Compounds of this last class are given in full in their proper
order in the Vocabulary.

Defn: Moving in the manner of undulations, or waves; resembling the
motion of waves, which successively rise or swell rise or swell and
fall; pertaining to a propagated alternating motion, similar to that
of waves. Undulatory theory, or Wave theory (of light) (Opt.), that
theory which regards its various phenomena as due to undulations in
an ethereal medium, propagated from the radiant with immense, but
measurable, velocities, and producing different impressions on the
retina according to their amplitude and frequency, the sensation of
brightness depending on the former, that of color on the latter. The
undulations are supposed to take place, not in the direction of
propagation, as in the air waves constituting sound, but
transversely, and the various phenomena of refraction, polarization,
interference, etc., are attributable to the different affections of
these undulations in different circumstances of propagation. It is
computed that the frequency of the undulations corresponding to the
several colors of the spectrum ranges from 458 millions of millions
per second for the extreme red ray, to 727 millions of millions for
the extreme violet, and their lengths for the same colors, from the
thirty-eight thousandth to the sixty thousandth part of an inch. The
theory of ethereal undulations is applicable not only to the
phenomena of light, but also to those of heat.

colorless stone set in the breastplate of the high priest as a symbol
of light, answering to the mystic scarab in the pectoral plate of the
ancient Egyptian priests, and that the Thummim was an image
corresponding to that worn by the priestly judges of Egypt as a
symbol of truth and purity of motive. By gazing steadfastly on these,
he may have been thrown into a mysterious, half ecstatic state, akin
to hypnotism, in which he lost all personal consciousness, and
received a spiritual illumination and insight.

good usage and great liberty. Shak.

3. Long-continued practice; customary mode of procedure; custom;
habitual use; method. Chaucer.

Macaulay.

4. Customary use or employment, as of a word or phrase in a
particular sense or signification.

5. Experience. [Obs.]
In eld [old age] is both wisdom and usage. Chaucer.

Syn.
 -- Custom; use; habit.
 -- Usage, Custom. These words, as here compared, agree in expressing
the idea of habitual practice; but a custom is not necessarily a
usage. A custom may belong to many, or to a single individual. A
usage properly belongs to the great body of a people. Hence, we speak
of usage, not of custom, as the law of language. Again, a custom is
merely that which has been often repeated, so as to have become, in a
good degree, established. A usage must be both often repeated and of
long standing. Hence, we speak of a "hew custom," but not of a "new
usage." Thus, also, the "customs of society" is not so strong an
expression as the "usages of society." "Custom, a greater power than
nature, seldom fails to make them worship." Locke. "Of things once
received and confirmed by use, long usage is a law sufficient."
Hooker. In law, the words usage and custom are often used
interchangeably, but the word custom also has a technical and
restricted sense. See Custom, n., 3.

7. The premium paid for the possession and employment of borrowed
money; interest; usury. [Obs.]

need, business, employment, work. Cf. Operate.] (Law)

Defn: The benefit or profit of lands and tenements. Use imports a
trust and confidence reposed in a man for the holding of lands. He to
whose use or benefit the trust is intended shall enjoy the profits.

USE
Use, v. t. [imp. & p. p. Used; p. pr. & vb. n. Using.] Etym: [OE.
usen, F. user to use, use up, wear out, LL. usare to use, from L.
uti, p. p. usus, to use, OL. oeti, oesus; of uncertain origin. Cf.
Utility.]

1. To make use of; to convert to one's service; to avail one's self
of; to employ; to put a purpose; as, to use a plow; to use a chair;

Syn.
 -- Employ.
 -- Use, Employ. We use a thing, or make use of it, when we derive
from it some enjoyment or service. We employ it when we turn that
service into a particular channel. We use words to express our
general meaning; we employ certain technical terms in reference to a
given subject. To make use of, implies passivity in the thing; as, to
make use of a pen; and hence there is often a material difference
between the two words when applied to persons. To speak of "making
use of another" generally implies a degrading idea, as if we had used
him as a tool; while employ has no such sense. A confidential friend
is employed to negotiate; an inferior agent is made use of on an
intrigue.
I would, my son, that thou wouldst use the power Which thy discretion
gives thee, to control And manage all. Cowper.
To study nature will thy time employ: Knowledge and innocence are
perfect joy. Dryden.

USE
Use, v. i.

1. To be wont or accustomed; to be in the habit or practice; as, he
used to ride daily; -- now disused in the present tense, perhaps
because of the similarity in sound, between "use to," and "used to."
They use to place him that shall be their captain on a stone.
Spenser.
Fears use to be represented in an imaginary. Bacon.
Thus we use to say, it is the room that smokes, when indeed it is the

Milton.

Syn.
 -- Fruitless; ineffectual.
 -- Useless, Fruitless, Ineffectual. We speak of an attempt, effort,
etc., as being useless when there are in it inherent difficulties
which forbid the hope of success, as fruitless when it fails, not
from any such difficulties, but from some unexpected hindrance
arising to frustrate it; as, the design was rendered fruitless by the
death of its projector. Ineffectual nearly resembles fruitless, but
implies a failure of a less hopeless character; as, after several
ineffectual efforts, I at last succeeded.
Useless are all words Till you have writ "performance" with your
swords. The other is for waiving. Beau. & Fl.
Waiving all searches into antiquity, in relation to this controversy,
as being either needless or fruitless. Waterland.

parties should agree to, like any other property, has gained ground
everywhere. Am. Cyc.

V

1. V, the twenty-second letter of the English alphabet, is a vocal
consonant. V and U are only varieties of the same character, U being
the cursive form, while V is better adapted for engraving, as in
stone. The two letters were formerly used indiscriminately, and till
a comparatively recent date words containing them were often classed
together in dictionaries and other books of reference (see U). The
letter V is from the Latin alphabet, where it was used both as a
consonant (about like English w) and as a vowel. The Latin derives it
from it from a form (V) of the Greek vowel UPSILON (see Y), this
Greek letter being either from the same Semitic letter as the digamma
F (see F), or else added by the Greeks to the alphabet which they
took from the Semitic. Etymologically v is most nearly related to u,
w, f, b, p; as in vine, wine; avoirdupois, habit, have; safe, save;
trover, troubadour, trope. See U, F, etc. See Guide to Pronunciation,
 265; also  155, 169, 178-179, etc.

1. (Physics)

Defn: Any substance in the gaseous, or aeriform, state, the condition
of which is ordinarily that of a liquid or solid.

Note: The term vapor is sometimes used in a more extended sense, as
identical with gas; and the difference between the two is not so much
one of kind as of degree, the latter being applied to all permanently
elastic fluids except atmospheric air, the former to those elastic
fluids which lose that condition at ordinary temperatures. The
atmosphere contains more or less vapor of water, a portion of which,
on a reduction of temperature, becomes condensed into liquid water in
the form of rain or dew. The vapor of water produced by boiling,
especially in its economic relations, is called steam.
Vapor is any substance in the gaseous condition at the maximum of
density consistent with that condition. This is the strict and proper
meaning of the word vapor. Nichol.

2. In a loose and popular sense, any visible diffused substance
floating in the atmosphere and impairing its transparency, as smoke,

differing from the rest in some one or more of the characteristics
typical of the species, and capable either of perpetuating itself for

Note: Varieties usually differ from species in that any two, however
unlike, will generally propagate indefinitely (unless they are in
their nature unfertile, as some varieties of rose and other
cultivated plants); in being a result of climate, food, or other
extrinsic conditions or influences, but generally by a sudden, rather
than a gradual, development; and in tending in many cases to lose
their distinctive peculiarities when the individuals are left to a
state of nature, and especially if restored to the conditions that
are natural to typical individuals of the species. Many varieties of
domesticated animals and of cultivated plants have been directly
produced by man.
(d) In inorganic nature, one of those forms in which a species may
occur, which differ in minor characteristics of structure, color,
purity of composition, etc.

Note: These may be viewed as variations from the typical species in
its most perfect and purest form, or, as is more commonly the case,
all the forms, including the latter, may rank as Varieties. Thus, the
sapphire is a blue variety, and the ruby a red variety, of corundum;
again, calcite has many Varieties differing in form and structure, as
Iceland spar, dogtooth spar, satin spar, and also others
characterized by the presence of small quantities of magnesia, iron,
manganese, etc. Still again, there are Varieties of granite differing
in structure, as graphic granite, porphyritic granite, and other
Varieties differing in composition, as albitic granite, hornblendic,
or syenitic, granite, etc. Geographical variety (Biol.), a variety of
any species which is coincident with a geographical region, and is
usually dependent upon, or caused by, peculiarities of climate.
 -- Variety hybrid (Biol.), a cross between two individuals of
different varieties of the same species; a mongrel.

Syn.
 -- Diversity; difference; kind.
 -- Variety, Diversity. A man has a variety of employments when he
does many things which are not a mere repetition of the same act; he
has a diversity of employments when the several acts performed are
unlike each other, that is, diverse. In most cases, where there is
variety there will be more or less of diversity, but not always. One
who sells railroad tickets performs a great variety of acts in a day,
while there is but little diversity in his employment.
