Equity had been gradually shaping itself into a refined science which
no human faculties could master without long and intense application.
Macaulay.

Note: Equitable jurisprudence in England and in the United States
grew up from the inadequacy of common-law forms to secure justice in
all cases; and this led to distinct courts by which equity was
applied in the way of injunctions, bills of discovery, bills for
specified performance, and other processes by which the merits of a
case could be reached more summarily or more effectively than by
common-law suits. By the recent English Judicature Act (1873),
however, the English judges are bound to give effect, in common-law
suits, to all equitable rights and remedies; and when the rules of
equity and of common law, in any particular case, conflict, the rules
of equity are to prevail. In many jurisdictions in the United States,
equity and common law are thus blended; in others distinct equity
tribunals are still maintained. See Chancery. Equity of redemption
(Law), the advantage, allowed to a mortgageor, of a certain or
reasonable time to redeem lands mortgaged, after they have been
forfeited at law by the nonpayment of the sum of money due on the
mortgage at the appointed time. Blackstone.

Browne.

2. (Chem.)

Defn: That comparative quantity by weight of an element which
possesses the same chemical value as other elements, as determined by
actual experiment and reference to the same standard. Specifically:
(a) The comparative proportions by which one element replaces another
in any particular compound; thus, as zinc replaces hydrogen in
hydrochloric acid, their equivalents are 32.5 and 1. (b) The
combining proportion by weight of a substance, or the number
expressing this proportion, in any particular compound; as, the
equivalents of hydrogen and oxygen in water are respectively 1 and 8,
and in hydric dioxide 1 and 16.

Note: This term was adopted by Wollaston to avoid using the
conjectural expression atomic weight, with which, however, for a time
it was practically synonymous. The attempt to limit the term to the
meaning of a universally comparative combining weight failed, because
of the possibility of several compounds of the substances by reason
of the variation in combining power which most elements exhibit. The
equivalent was really identical with, or a multiple of submultiple
of, the atomic weight.

3. (Chem.)

Defn: A combining unit, whether an atom, a radical, or a molecule;
as, in acid salt two or more equivalents of acid unite with one or
more equivalents of base. Mechanical equivalent of heat (Physics),
the number of units of work which the unit of heat can perform; the
mechanical energy which must be expended to raise the temperature of
a unit weight of water from 0? C. to 1? C., or from 32? F. to 33? F.
The term was introduced by Dr. Mayer of Heilbronn. Its value was
found by Joule to be 1390 foot pounds upon the Centigrade, or 772
foot pounds upon the Fahrenheit, thermometric scale, whence it is
often called Joule's equivalent, and represented by the symbol J.
This is equal to 424 kilogram meters (Centigrade scale). A more
recent determination by Professor Rowland gives the value 426.9
kilogram meters, for the latitude of Baltimore.

Milton.

3. Uncertain, as an indication or sign; doubtful. "How equivocal a
test." Burke. Equivocal chord (Mus.), a chord which can be resolved
into several distinct keys; one whose intervals, being all minor
thirds, do not clearly indicate its fundamental tone or root; the
chord of the diminished triad, and the diminished seventh.

Syn.
 -- Ambiguous; doubtful; uncertain; indeterminate.
 -- Equivocal, Ambiguous. We call an expression ambiguous when it has
one general meaning, and yet contains certain words which may be
taken in two different senses; or certain clauses which can be so
connected with other clauses as to divide the mind between different
views of part of the meaning intended. We call an expression
equivocal when, taken as a whole, it conveys a given thought with
perfect clearness and propriety, and also another thought with equal
propriety and clearness. Such were the responses often given by the
Delphic oracle; as that to Crambiguous is a mere blunder of language;
what is equivocal is usually intended to deceive, though it may occur
at times from mere inadvertence. Equivocation is applied only to
cases where there is a design to deceive.

distinction is not essential. Tomlins. Kent.

Es"ti*mate, v. t. [imp. & p. p. Estimated; p. pr. & vb. n.

t.]

1. To judge and form an opinion of the value of, from imperfect data,
-- either the extrinsic (money), or intrinsic (moral), value; to fix

of goods or land; to estimate the worth or talents of a person.

roughly; to rate; as, to estimate the cost of a trip, the number of
feet in a piece of land.

Syn.
 -- To appreciate; value; appraise; prize; rate; esteem; count;
calculate; number.
 -- To Estimate, Esteem. Both these words imply an exercise of the
judgment. Estimate has reference especially to the external relations
of things, such as amount, magnitude, importance, etc. It usually
involves computation or calculation; as, to estimate the loss or gain
of an enterprise. Esteem has reference to the intrinsic or moral
worth of a person or thing. Thus, we esteem a man for his kindness,
or his uniform integrity. In this sense it implies a mingled
sentiment of respect and attachment. We esteem it an honor to live in
a free country. See Appreciate.

J. C. Shairp.

Syn.
 -- Estimate, Estimation, Esteem. The noun estimate, like its verb,
supposes chiefly an exercise of judgment in determining the amount,
importance, or magnitude of things, with their other exterior
relations; as, an estimate of expenses incurred; a true estimate of
life, etc. Esteem is a moral sentiment made up of respect and
attachment, -- the valuation of a person as possessing useful
qualities or real worth. Thus we speak of the esteem of the wise and
good as a thing greatly to be desired. Estimation seems to waver
between the two. In our version of the Scriptures it is used simply
for estimate; as, "If he be poorer than thy estimation." Lev. xxvii.
8. In other cases, it verges toward esteem; as, "I know him to be of
worth and worthy estimation." Shak. It will probably settle down at
last on this latter sense. "Esteem is the value we place upon some
degree of worth. It is higher than simple approbation, which is a
decision of judgment. It is the commencement of affection." Gogan.
No; dear as freedom is, and in my heart's Just estimation prized
above all price. Cowper.

Syn.
 -- Incident; occurrence; adventure; issue; result; termination;
consequence; conclusion.
 -- Event, Occurrence, Incident, Circumstance. An event denotes that
which arises from a preceding state of things. Hence we speak or
watching the event; of tracing the progress of events. An occurrence
has no reference to any antecedents, but simply marks that which
meets us in our progress through life, as if by chance, or in the
course of divine providence. The things which thus meet us, if
important, are usually connected with antecedents; and hence event is
the leading term. In the "Declaration of Independence" it is said,
"When, in the cource of human events, it becomes necessary." etc.
Here, occurrences would be out of place. An incident is that which
falls into a state of things to which is does not primarily belong;
as, the incidents of a journey. The term is usually applied to things
of secondary importance. A circumstance is one of the things
surrounding us in our path of life. These may differ greatly in
importance; but they are always outsiders, which operate upon us from
without, exerting greater or less influence according to their
intrinsic importance. A person giving an account of a campaign might
dwell on the leading events which it produced; might mention some of
its striking occurrences; might allude to some remarkable incidents
which attended it; and might give the details of the favorable or
adverse circumstances which marked its progress.

EXAMPLARY
Ex"am*pla*ry, a. Etym: [From Example, cf. Exemplary.]

EXAMPLE
Ex*am"ple, n. Etym: [A later form for ensample, fr. L. exemplum,
orig., what is taken out of a larger quantity, as a sample, from
eximere to take out. See Exempt, and cf. Ensample, Sample.]

1. One or a portion taken to show the character or quality of the
whole; a sample; a specimen.

2. That which is to be followed or imitated as a model; a pattern or
copy.
For I have given you an example, that ye should do as John xiii. 15.
I gave, thou sayest, the example; I led the way. Milton.

Syn.
 -- Precedent; case; instance.
 -- Example, Instance. The discrimination to be made between these
two words relates to cases in which we give "instances" or "examples"
of things done. An instance denotes the single case then "standing"
before us; if there be others like it, the word does not express this
fact. On the contrary, an example is one of an entire class of like
things, and should be a true representative or sample of that class.
Hence, an example proves a rule or regular course of things; an
instance simply points out what may be true only in the case
presented. A man's life may be filled up with examples of the self-
command and kindness which marked his character, and may present only
a solitary instance of haste or severity. Hence, the word "example"
should never be used to describe what stands singly and alone. We do,
however, sometimes apply the word instance to what is really an
example, because we are not thinking of the latter under this aspect,
but solely as a case which "stands before us." See Precedent.

oie, Goth. aug; cf. OSlav. oko, Lish. akis, L. okulus, Gr. , eye, ,
the two eyes, Skr. akshi. Diasy, Ocular, Optic, Eyelet, Ogle.]

1. The organ of sight or vision. In man, and the vertebrates
generally, it is properly the movable ball or globe in the orbit, but
the term often includes the adjacent parts. In most invertebrates the
years are immovable ocelli, or compound eyes made up of numerous
ocelli. See Ocellus. Description of illustration: a b Conjunctiva; c
Cornea; d Sclerotic; e Choroid; f Cillary Muscle; g Cillary Process;
h Iris; i Suspensory Ligament; k Prosterior Aqueous Chamber between h
and i; l Anterior Aqueous Chamber; m Crystalline Lens; n Vitreous
Humor; o Retina; p Yellow spot; q Center of blind spot; r Artery of
Retina in center of the Optic Nerve.

Note: The essential parts of the eye are inclosed in a tough outer
coat, the sclerotic, to which the muscles moving it are attached, and
which in front changes into the transparent cornea. A little way back
of cornea, the crystalline lens is suspended, dividing the eye into
two unequal cavities, a smaller one in front filled with a watery
fluid, the aqueous humor, and larger one behind filled with a clear
jelly, the vitreous humor. The sclerotic is lined with a highly
pigmented membrane, the choroid, and this is turn is lined in the
back half of the eyeball with the nearly transparent retina, in which
the fibers of the optic nerve ramify. The choroid in front is
continuous with the iris, which has a contractile opening in the
center, the pupil, admitting light to the lens which brings the rays
to a focus and forms an image upon the retina, where the light,
falling upon delicate structures called rods and cones, causes them
to stimulate the fibres of the optic nerve to transmit visual
impressions to the brain.

2. The faculty of seeing; power or range of vision; hence, judgment
or taste in the use of the eye, and in judging of objects; as, to
have the eye of sailor; an eye for the beautiful or picturesque.

FAT
Fat, n.

1. (Physiol. Chem.)

Defn: An oily liquid or greasy substance making up the main bulk of
the adipose tissue of animals, and widely distributed in the seeds of
plants. See Adipose tissue, under Adipose.

Note: Animal fats are composed mainly of three distinct fats,
tristearin, tripalmitin, and triolein, mixed in varying proportions.
As olein is liquid at ordinary temperatures, while the other two fats
are solid, it follows that the consistency or hardness of fats
depends upon the relative proportion of the three individual fats.
During the life of an animal, the fat is mainly in a liquid state in
the fat cells, owing to the solubility of the two solid fats in the
more liquid olein at the body temperature. Chemically, fats are
composed of fatty acid, as stearic, palmitic, oleic, etc., united
with glyceryl. In butter fat, olein and palmitin predominate, mixed
with another fat characteristic of butter, butyrin. In the vegetable
kingdom many other fats or glycerides are to be found, as myristin
from nutmegs, a glyceride of lauric acid in the fat of the bay tree,
etc.

2. The best or richest productions; the best part; as, to live on the

acids.

punishment may be added, according to the degree of guilt.

3. A heinous crime; especially, a crime punishable by death or
imprisonment.

Note: Forfeiture for crime having been generally abolished in the
United States, the term felony, in American law, has lost this point
of distinction; and its meaning, where not fixed by statute, is
somewhat vague and undefined; generally, however, it is used to
denote an offense of a high grade, punishable either capitally or by
a term of imprisonment. In Massachusetts, by statute, any crime
punishable by death or imprisonment in the state prison, and no
other, is a felony; so in New York. the tendency now is to obliterate
the distinction between felonies and misdemeanors; and this has been
done partially in England, and completely in some of the States of
the Union. The distinction is purely arbitrary, and its entire
abolition is only a question of time.

Note: There is no lawyer who would undertake to tell what a felony
is, otherwise than by enumerating the various kinds of offenses which
are so called. originally, the word felony had a meaning: it denoted
all offenses the penalty of which included forfeiture of goods; but
subsequent acts of Parliament have declared various offenses to be
felonies, without enjoining that penalty, and have taken away the
penalty from others, which continue, nevertheless, to be called
felonies, insomuch that the acts so called have now no property
whatever in common, save that of being unlawful and purnishable. J.
S. Mill.

1. That which causes fermentation, as yeast, barm, or fermenting
beer.

Note: Ferments are of two kinds: (a) Formed or organized ferments.
(b) Unorganized or structureless ferments. The latter are also called
soluble or chemical ferments, and enzymes. Ferments of the first
class are as a rule simple microscopic vegetable organisms, and the
fermentations which they engender are due to their growth and
development; as, the acetic ferment, the butyric ferment, etc. See
Fermentation. Ferments of the second class, on the other hand, are
chemical substances, as a rule soluble in glycerin and precipitated
by alcohol. In action they are catalytic and, mainly, hydrolytic.
Good examples are pepsin of the dastric juice, ptyalin of the salvia,
and disease of malt. globular proteins, capable of catalyzing a wide
variety of chemical reactions, not merely hydrolytic. The full set of
enzymes causing production of ethyl alcohol from sugar has been

organic substance into new compounds by the action of a ferment,
either formed or unorganized. It differs in kind according to the
nature of the ferment which causes it.

2. A state of agitation or excitement, as of the intellect or the
feelings.
It puts the soul to fermentation and activity. Jer. Taylor.
A univesal fermentation of human thought and faith. C. Kingsley.
Acetous, or Acetic, fermentation, a form of oxidation in which
alcohol is converted into vinegar or acetic acid by the agency of a
specific fungus or ferment (Mycoderma aceti). The process involves
two distinct reactions, in which the oxygen of the air is essential.
An intermediate product, aldehyde, is formed in the first process. 1.
C2H6O + O = H2O + C2H4O

Note: Alcohol. Water. Aldehyde. 2. C2H4O + O = C2H4O2

Note: Aldehyde. Acetic acid.
 -- Alcoholic fermentation, the fermentation which saccharine bodies
undergo when brought in contact with the yeast plant or Torula. The
sugar is converted, either directly or indirectly, into alcohol and
carbonic acid, the rate of action being dependent on the rapidity
with which the Torul? develop.
 -- Ammoniacal fermentation, the conversion of the urea of the urine
into ammonium carbonate, through the growth of the special urea
ferment. CON2H4 + 2H2O = (NH4)2CO3

Note: Urea. Water. Ammonium carbonate.

Note: Whenever urine is exposed to the air in open vessels for
several days it undergoes this alkaline fermentation.
 -- Butyric fermentation, the decomposition of various forms of
organic matter, through the agency of a peculiar worm-shaped vibrio,
with formation of more or less butyric acid. It is one of the many
forms of fermentation that collectively constitute putrefaction. See
Lactic fermentation.
 -- Fermentation by an unorganized ferment or enzyme. Fermentations
of this class are purely chemical reactions, in which the ferment
acts as a simple catalytic agent. Of this nature are the
decomposition or inversion of cane sugar into levulose and dextrose
by boiling with dilute acids, the conversion of starch into dextrin
and sugar by similar treatment, the conversion of starch into like
products by the action of diastase of malt or ptyalin of saliva, the
conversion of albuminous food into peptones and other like products
by the action of pepsin-hydrochloric acid of the gastric juice or by
the ferment of the pancreatic juice.
 -- Fermentation theory of disease (Biol. & Med.), the theory that
most if not all, infectious or zymotic disease are caused by the
introduction into the organism of the living germs of ferments, or
ferments already developed (organized ferments), by which processes
of fermentation are set up injurious to health. See Germ theory.
 -- Glycerin fermentation, the fermentation which occurs on mixing a
dilute solution of glycerin with a peculiar species of schizomycetes
and some carbonate of lime, and other matter favorable to the growth
of the plant, the glycerin being changed into butyric acid, caproic
acid, butyl, and ethyl alcohol. With another form of bacterium
(Bacillus subtilis) ethyl alcohol and butyric acid are mainly formed.
 -- Lactic fermentation, the transformation of milk sugar or other
saccharine body into lactic acid, as in the souring of milk, through
the agency of a special bacterium (Bacterium lactis of Lister). In
this change the milk sugar, before assuming the form of lactic acid,
presumably passes through the stage of glucose. C12H22O11.H2O =
4C3H6O3

Note: Hydrated milk sugar. Lactic acid.

Note: In the lactic fermentation of dextrose or glucose, the lactic
acid which is formed is very prone to undergo butyric fermentation
after the manner indicated in the following equation: 2C3H6O3 (lactic
acid) = C4H8O2 (butyric acid) + 2CO2 (carbonic acid) + 2H2 (hydrogen
gas).
 -- Putrefactive fermentation. See Putrefaction.

FERMENTATION THEORY
Fer`men*ta"tion the"o*ry. (Med.)

1. (Opt.)

Defn: A point in which the rays of light meet, after being reflected
or refrcted, and at which the image is formed; as, the focus of a
lens or mirror.

2. (Geom.)

Defn: A point so related to a conic section and certain straight line
called the directrix that the ratio of the distace between any point
of the curve and the focus to the distance of the same point from the
directrix is constant.

Note: Thus, in the ellipse FGHKLM, A is the focus and CD the
directrix, when the ratios FA:FE, GA:GD, MA:MC, etc., are all equal.
So in the hyperbola, A is the focus and CD the directrix when the
ratio HA:HK is constant for all points of the curve; and in the
parabola, A is the focus and CD the directrix when the ratio BA:BC is
constant. In the ellipse this ratio is less than unity, in the
parabola equal to unity, and in the hyperbola greater than unity. The
ellipse and hyperbola have each two foci, and two corresponding
directrixes, and the parabola has one focus and one directrix. In the
ellipse the sum of the two lines from any point of the curve to the
two foci is constant; that is: AG+GB=AH+HB; and in the hyperbola the
difference of the corresponding lines is constant. The diameter which
passes through the foci of the ellipse is the major axis. The
diameter which being produced passes through the foci of the
hyperbola is the transverse axis. The middle point of the major or
the transverse axis is the center of the curve. Certain other curves,
as the lemniscate and the Cartesian ovals, have points called foci,
possessing properties similar to those of the foci of conic sections.
In an ellipse, rays of light coming from one focus, and reflected
from the curve, proceed in lines directed toward the other; in an
hyperbola, in lines directed from the other; in a parabola, rays from
the focus, after reflection at the curve, proceed in lines parallel
to the axis. Thus rays from A in the ellipse are reflected to B; rays
from A in the hyperbola are reflected toward L and M away from B.

3. A central point; a point of concentration. Aplanatic focus. (Opt.)
See under Aplanatic.
 -- Conjugate focus (Opt.), the focus for rays which have a sensible
divergence, as from a near object; -- so called because the positions

effect.
 -- Principal, or Solar, focus (Opt.), the focus for parallel rays.

Food, n. Etym: [OE. fode, AS. foda; akin to Icel. f?\'eba, f?\'ebi,
Sw. foda, Dan. & LG. fode, OHG. fatunga, Gr. patei^sthai to eat, and
perh. to Skr. pa to protect, L. pascere to feed, pasture, pabulum
food, E. pasture. *75. Cf. Feed, Fodder food, Foster to cherish.]

1. What is fed upon; that which goes to support life by being
received within, and assimilated by, the organism of an animal or a
plant; nutriment; aliment; especially, what is eaten by animals for
nourishment.

Note: In a physiological sense, true aliment is to be distinguished
as that portion of the food which is capable of being digested and
absorbed into the blood, thus furnishing nourishment, in distinction
from the indigestible matter which passes out through the alimentary
canal as f?ces.

Note: Foods are divided into two main groups: nitrogenous, or
proteid, foods, i.e., those which contain nitrogen, and
nonnitrogenous, i.e., those which do not contain nitrogen. The latter
group embraces the fats and carbohydrates, which collectively are
sometimes termed heat producers or respiratory foods, since by
oxidation in the body they especially subserve the production of
heat. The proteids, on the other hand, are known as plastic foods or
tissue formers, since no tissue can be formed without them. These
latter terms, however, are misleading, since proteid foods may also
give rise to heat both directly and indirectly, and the fats and
carbohydrates are useful in other ways than in producing heat.

2. Anything that instructs the intellect, excites the feelings, or
molds habits of character; that which nourishes.
This may prove food to my displeasure. Shak.
In this moment there is life and food For future years. Wordsworth.

of the spaces in the interior of a protozoan in which food is
contained, during digestion.

strength of will and force of will; but even here the former may lean
toward the internal tenacity of purpose, and the latter toward the
outward expression of it in action. But, though the two words do in a
few cases touch thus closely on each other, there is, on the whole, a
marked distinction in our use of force and strength. "Force is the
name given, in mechanical science, to whatever produces, or can
produce, motion." Nichol.

the other. Thus, the circumference of a circle is a function of the
diameter. If x be a symbol to which different numerical values can be
assigned, such expressions as x2, 3x, Log. x, and Sin. x, are all
functions of x. Algebraic function, a quantity whose connection with
the variable is expressed by an equation that involves only the
algebraic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division, raising to a given power, and extracting a given root; --
opposed to transcendental function.
 -- Arbitrary function. See under Arbitrary.
 -- Calculus of functions. See under Calculus.
 -- Carnot's function (Thermo-dynamics), a relation between the
amount of heat given off by a source of heat, and the work which can

expansion.
 -- Circular functions. See Inverse trigonometrical functions
(below).
 -- Continuous function, a quantity that has no interruption in the
continuity of its real values, as the variable changes between any
specified limits.
 -- Discontinuous function. See under Discontinuous.
 -- Elliptic functions, a large and important class of functions, so
called because one of the forms expresses the relation of the arc of
an ellipse to the straight lines connected therewith.
 -- Explicit function, a quantity directly expressed in terms of the
independently varying quantity; thus, in the equations y = 6x2, y =
10 -x3, the quantity y is an explicit function of x.
 -- Implicit function, a quantity whose relation to the variable is
expressed indirectly by an equation; thus, y in the equation x2 + y2
= 100 is an implicit function of x.
 -- Inverse trigonometrical functions, or Circular function, the
lengths of arcs relative to the sines, tangents, etc. Thus, AB is the
arc whose sine is BD, and (if the length of BD is x) is written sin -
1x, and so of the other lines. See Trigonometrical function (below).
Other transcendental functions are the exponential functions, the
elliptic functions, the gamma functions, the theta functions, etc.
 -- One-valued function, a quantity that has one, and only one, value
for each value of the variable.
 -- Transcendental functions, a quantity whose connection with the
variable cannot be expressed by algebraic operations; thus, y in the
equation y = 10x is a transcendental function of x. See Algebraic
function (above).
 -- Trigonometrical function, a quantity whose relation to the
variable is the same as that of a certain straight line drawn in a
circle whose radius is unity, to the length of a corresponding are of
the circle. Let AB be an arc in a circle, whose radius OA is unity
let AC be a quadrant, and let OC, DB, and AF be drawnpependicular to
OA, and EB and CG parallel to OA, and let OB be produced to G and F.
E Then BD is the sine of the arc AB; OD or EB is the cosine, AF is
the tangent, CG is the cotangent, OF is the secant OG is the
cosecant, AD is the versed sine, and CE is the coversed sine of the
are AB. If the length of AB be represented by x (OA being unity) then
the lengths of Functions. these lines (OA being unity) are the
trigonometrical functions of x, and are written sin x, cos x, tan x
(or tang x), cot x, sec x, cosec x, versin x, coversin x. These
quantities are also considered as functions of the angle BOA.

 -- Genius, Talent. Genius implies high and peculiar gifts of nature,
impelling the mind to certain favorite kinds of mental effort, and
producing new combinations of ideas, imagery, etc. Talent supposes
general strength of intellect, with a peculiar aptitude for being
molded and directed to specific employments and valuable ends and
purposes. Genius is connected more or less with the exercise of
imagination, and reaches its ends by a kind of intuitive power.
Talent depends more on high mental training, and a perfect command of
all the faculties, memory, judgment, sagacity, etc. Hence we speak of
a genius for poetry, painting. etc., and a talent for business or
diplomacy. Among English orators, Lord Chatham was distinguished for
his genius; William Pitt for his preeminent talents, and especially

GEOMETRIC; GEOMETRICAL
Ge`o*met"ric, Ge`o*met"ric*al, a. Etym: [L. geometricus; Gr.
geometrique.]

Defn: Pertaining to, or according to the rules or principles of,
geometry; determined by geometry; as, a geometrical solution of a
problem.

Note: Geometric is often used, as opposed to algebraic, to include
processes or solutions in which the propositions or principles of
geometry are made use of rather than those of algebra.

Note: Geometrical is often used in a limited or strictly technical
sense, as opposed to mechanical; thus, a construction or solution is
geometrical which can be made by ruler and compasses, i. e., by means
of right lines and circles. Every construction or solution which
requires any other curve, or such motion of a line or circle as would
generate any other curve, is not geometrical, but mechanical. By
another distinction, a geometrical solution is one obtained by the
rules of geometry, or processes of analysis, and hence is exact;
while a mechanical solution is one obtained by trial, by actual
measurements, with instruments, etc., and is only approximate and
empirical. Geometrical curve. Same as Algebraic curve; -- so called
because their different points may be constructed by the operations
of elementary geometry.
