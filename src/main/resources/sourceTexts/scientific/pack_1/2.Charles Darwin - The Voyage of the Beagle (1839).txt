Humboldt's, who often alludes to "the thin vapour which, without changing the transparency of the air, renders its tints more
harmonious, and softens its effects." This is an appearance
which I have never observed in the temperate zones. The at-

view extended over an immense level plain as far as the Mount,
at Monte Video, and to the eastward, over the mammilla! ed

were several small heaps of stones, which evidently had lain there
for many years.
My companion assured me that they were the
work of the Indians in the old time. The heaps were similar,
but on a much smaller scale, to those so commonly found on the
mountains of Wales. The desire to signalize any event, on the

Beagle arrived here on the 24th of August, and a week afterwards sailed for the Plata. With Captain Fitz Roy's consent I
was left behind, to travel by land to Buenos Ay res. I will here

add some observations, which were made during this visit and
on a previous occasion, when the Beagle was employed in surveying the harbour.
The plain, at the distance of a few miles from the coast,
belongs to the great Pampean formation, which consists in part
of a reddish clay, and in part of a highly calcareous marly rock.

Nearer the coast there are some plains formed from the wreck
of the upper plain, and from mud, gravel, and sand thrown up
by the sea during the slow elevation of the land, of which elevation we have evidence in upraised beds of recent shells, and in
At
rounded pebbles of pumice scattered over the country.
Punta Alta we have a section of one of these later-formed little
plains, which is highly interesting from the number and extraordinary character of the remains of gigantic land-animals embedded in it. These have been fully described by Professor
Owen, in the Zoology of the voyage of the Beagle, and are deposited in the
College of Surgeons. I will here give only a brief
outline of their nature.

At the distance of a little more than one hour's
march from their place of encampment on the previous night,
his party actually killed at one spot eight hippopotamuses, and
saw many more. In this same river there were likewise crocodiles.
Of course it was a case quite extraordinary, to see so
many great animals crowded together, but it evidently proves
that they must exist in great numbers.
Dr. Smith describes the
country passed through that day, as "being thinly covered with
grass, and bushes about four feet high, and still more thinly

viction of the necessity of a vegetation possessing a character of
tropical luxuriance, to support such large animals, and the impossibility of reconciling this with the proximity of perpetual

were invented to account for their entombment. I am far from

supposing that the climate has not changed since the period
when those animals lived, which now lie buried in the ice. At

think I ever saw any thing more ugly, excepting, perhaps,

face and thus we obtain a scale of hideousness.
Amongst the Batrachian reptiles, I found only one little toad
(Phryniscus nigricans), which was most singular from its colour.
If we imagine, first, that it had been steeped in the blackest ink,
and then, when dry, allowed to crawl over a board, freshly
painted with the brightest vermilion, so as to colour the soles of
its feet and parts of its stomach, a good idea of its appearance
will be gained.

f M. A. d'Orbigny (vol. i. p. 474) says that the cardoon and artichoke are
both found wild. Dr. Hooker (Botanical Magazine, vol. lv. p. 2862), has
described a variety of the Cynara from this part of South America under
the name of inermis.
He states that botanists are now generally agreed that
the cardoon and the artichoke are varieties of one plant.
I may add, that an
intelligent farmer assured me that he had observed in a deserted garden
some artichokes changing into the common cardoon. Dr. Hooker believes
that Head's vivid description of the thistle of the Pampas applies to the cardoon but this is a mistake. Captain Head referred to the plant, which I
have mentioned a few lines lower down, under the title of giant thistle.
Whether it is a true thistle, I do not know but it is quite different from the
cardoon and more like a thistle properly so called.

during one half of the year are covered with giant thistles, to
the exclusion of other plants.
The Gauchos affirm that it lives
on roots; which, from the great strength of its gnawing teeth,

and the kind of places frequented by it, seems probable. In the
evening the bizcachas come out in numbers, and quietly sit at
the mouths of their burrows on their haunches.

In the morning we arrived at St. Fe. I was surprised to
how great a change of climate a difference of only three
degrees of latitude between this place and Buenos Ayres had
caused.
This was evident from the dress and complexion of the
men from the increased size of the ombu-trees the number of
new cacti and other plants and especially from the birds. In
the course of an hour I remarked half-a-dozen birds, which I had
never seen at Buenos Ayres. Considering that there is no natural
boundary between the two places, and that the character of the
country is nearly similar, the difference was much greater than I
should have expected.

I was delayed here five days, and employed myself in examining the geology of the surrounding country, which was very
interesting. We here see at the bottom of the cliffs, beds containing sharks' teeth and sea-shells of extinct species, passing above
into an indurated marl, and from that into the red clayey earth
of the Pampas, with its calcareous concretions and the bones of
terrestrial quadrupeds.
This vertical section clearly tells us of a
large bay of pure salt-water, gradually encroached on, and at last
converted into the bed of a muddy estuary, into which floating
carcasses were swept.
At Punta Gorda, in Banda Oriental, I

found an alternation of the Pampaean estuary deposit, with a
limestone containing some of the same extinct sea-shells and

alone have passed the barrier, and may be considered as wanderers from the south, such as the puma, opossum, kinkajou, and peccari.
South America is characterized by possessing many peculiar

gnawers, a family of monkeys, the llama, peccari, tapir, opossums,
and, especially, several genera of Edentata, the order which includes the sloths, ant-eaters, and armadillos.
North America,
on the other hand, is characterized (putting on one side a few

wandering species) by numerous peculiar gnawers, and by four
genera (the ox, sheep, goat, and antelope) of hollow-horned
ruminants, of which great division South America is not known
to possess a single species.

Formerly, but within the period

when most of the now existing shells were living, North
America possessed, besides hollow-horned ruminants, the elephant, mastodon, horse, and three genera of Edentata, namely,
the Megatherium, Megalonyx, and Mylodon. Within nearly this
same periods (as proved by the shells at Bahia Blanca) South
possessed, as we have just seen, a mastodon, horse,
hollow-horned ruminant, and the same three genera (as well as
several others) of the Edentata.
Hence it is evident that North

America

and South America, in having within a late geological period
these several genera in common, were much more closely related
in the character of their terrestrial inhabitants than they

now are.

When America, and especially North America, possessed its
elephants, mastodons, horse, and hollow-horned ruminants, it was
much more closely related in its zoological characters to the
temperate parts of Europe and Asia than it now is. As the
remains of these genera are found on both sides of Behring's

of North America as the former point of
communication between the Old and so-called New World. And
as so many species, both living and extinct, of these same genera
inhabit and have inhabited the Old World, it seems most probable
that the North American elephants, mastodons, horse, and hollow horned ruminants migrated, on land since submerged near Behring's Straits, from Siberia into North America, and thence, on
land since submerged in the West Indies, into South America,
where for a time they mingled with the forms characteristic of
that southern continent, and have since become extinct.

very apt to be blown out to sea. The most remarkable instance

If during a
warm day we look either at the shadow of any object cast on a

bank, or over a level plain at a distant landmark, the effect of an
ascending current of heated air is almost always evident : such

upward currents, it has been remarked, are also shown by the
ascent of soap-bubbles, which will not rise in an in-doors room.
Hence I think there is not much difficulty in understanding the
ascent of the fine lines projected from a spider's spinners, and
afterwards of the spider itself; the divergence of the lines has

been attempted to be explained, I believe by Mr. Murray, by
their similar electrical condition.

SANTA CRUZ, PATAGONIA, AND THE FALKLAND ISLANDS.

This river is situated about sixty miles south of
Port St. Julian. During the last voyage Captain Stokes probut then, from the want of provisions,
Excepting what was discovered at that
time, scarcely anything was known about this large river.
Captain Fitz Roy now determined to follow its course as far as time
would allow. On the 18th three whale-boats started, carrying
three weeks' provisions
and the party consisted of twenty-five
souls

These animals, as well as the cattle, were introduced by the

It is a curious fact, that the horses have never left the eastern
end of the island, although there is no natural boundary to prevent them from roaming, and that part of the island is not more
tempting than the rest. The Gauchos whom I asked, though
asserting this to be the case, were unable to account for it, except from the strong attachment which horses have to any locawhich they are accustomed. Considering that the island

The old man addressed a long harangue to Jemmy, which it seems was to invite
him to stay with them. But Jemmy understood very little of
their language, and was, moreover, thoroughly ashamed of his
countrymen. When York Minster afterwards came on shore,

retarded in the more elevated, and therefore colder situations, must be

icebergs being charged with fragments of rock, explains the origin

and position of the gigantic boulders of eastern Tierra del Fuego,
on the high plain of Santa Cruz, and on the island of Chiloe.
In Tierra del Fuego, the greater number of boulders lie on the
of old sea-channels, now converted into dry valleys by the

Although it is
a fallacy, as I have endeavoured to show in a former chapter, to
suppose that the larger quadrupeds require a luxuriant vegetation for their support, nevertheless it is important to find in
the South Shetland Islands, a frozen under-soil within 360 miles

of the forest-clad islands near Cape Horn, where, as far as the
bulk of vegetation is concerned, any number of
great quadrupeds
might be supported. The perfect preservation of the carcasses

fact, that Molina, though describing in detail all the

from Valparaiso

to the

the island of Chiloe, and the broken land called the Chonos Ar-

21st we anchored in the bay of S. Carlos, the capital of Chiloe.

This island

is

about ninety miles long, with a breadth of rather

than thirty. The land is hilly, but not mountainous, and is
covered by one great forest, except where a few green patches have
been cleared round the thatched cottages. From a distance the

During most earthquakes, and especially during those on

Some authors have

attempted to explain this, by supposing that the water retains its
level, whilst the land oscillates upwards ; but surely the water
close to the land, even on a rather steep coast, would partake of
the motion of the bottom : moreover, as urged by Mr. Lyell,
similar movements of the sea have occurred at islands far distant

from the chief line of disturbance, as was the case with Juan

I frequently observed, both in Tierra del Fuego and within

quicker disintegration of the solid rock under the snow, was deceptive.
Whatever the cause may be, the quantity of crumbling
stone on the Cordillera is very great.
Occasionally in the spring,
great masses of this detritus slide down the mountains, and cover
the snow-drifts in the valleys, thus
forming natural ice-houses.

either of lava and scoriae, or of finely-stratified, sandstone-like
tuff.
Most of the latter are beautifully symmetrical they owe
their origin to eruptions of volcanic mud without any lava
it is a remarkable circumstance that
every one of the twentyeight tuff-craters which were examined, had their southern sides
either much lower than the other sides, or quite broken down
and removed. As all these craters apparently have been formed
when standing in the sea, and as the waves from the trade wind
and the swell from the open Pacific here unite their forces on the
southern coasts of all the islands, this singular uniformity in
the broken state of the craters, composed of the soft and

explained.

Considering that these islands are placed directly under the
equator, the climate is far from being excessively hot ; this seems
chiefly caused by the singularly low temperature of the surrounding water, brought here by the great southern Polar current.

Hence, whilst the lower parts of the islands are very sterile, the
upper parts, at a height of a thousand feet and upwards, possess a
damp climate and a tolerably luxuriant vegetation. This is
especially the case on the windward sides of the islands, which
first receive and condense the moisture from the
atmosphere.
In the morning (17th) we landed on Chatham Island, which,
like the others, rises with a tame and rounded outline, broken
here and there by scattered hillocks, the remains of former
craters.

One day we accompanied a party of the Spaniards in their
whale-boat to a salina, or lake from which salt is procured.
After landing, we had a very rough walk over a
rugged field of
recent lava, which has almost surrounded a tuff-crater, at the
bottom of which the salt- lake lies. The water is
only three or
four inches deep, and rests on a layer of
beautifully crystallized,
white salt. The lake is quite circular, and is fringed with a border
of bright green succulent plants ; the almost precipitous walls of
the crater are clothed with wood, so that the scene was

The natural history of these islands is eminently curious, and
well deserves attention.
Most of the organic productions are
aboriginal creations, found nowhere else ; there is even a difference between the inhabitants of the different islands ; yet all

show a marked relationship with those of America, though separated from that continent by an open space of ocean, between
500 and 600 miles in width. The archipelago is a little world
within itself, or rather a satellite attached to America, whence
it has derived a few
stray colonists, and has received the general
character of

birds in this archipelago, one species had been taken and modified for different ends. In a like manner it might be fancied that a
bird originally a buzzard, had been induced here to undertake the
office of the carrion-feeding Polybori of the American continent.
Of waders and water-birds I was able to get only eleven kinds,
and of these only three (including a rail confined to the damp summits of the islands) are new species. Considering the
wandering
habits of the gulls, I was surprised to find that the species inhabiting these islands is peculiar, but allied to one from the

southern parts of South America.
The far greater peculiarity of
the land-birds, namely, twenty-five out of twenty-six being new
species or at least new races, compared with the waders and

web-footed birds, is in accordance with the greater range which
these latter orders have in all parts of the world.

it is doubtful whether or not it is distinct from its
analogue.
The two owls, the two tyrant fly-catchers (Pyrocephalus) and the

which they are most nearly related ; on the other hand, the gull
rather larger. The two owls, the swallow, all three species of

With the exception of a wren with a fine yellow breast, and of a
tyrant fly-catcher with a scarlet tuft and breast, none of the birds
are brilliantly coloured, as might have been expected in an equatorial district.

the peculiar Galapageian species also smaller, as
well as very generally more dusky coloured. All the plants have a
wretched, weedy appearance, and I did not see one beautiful flower.

The

insects, again,

are small sized and dull coloured, and, as

Mr. Waterhouse informs me, there is nothing in their general
appearance which would have led him to imagine that they had
come from under the equator. The birds, plants, and insects
have a desert character, and are not more brilliantly coloured
than those from southern Patagonia ; we may, therefore, conclude that the usual gaudy colouring of the intertropical productions, is not related either to the heat or light of those zones,

but to some other cause, perhaps to the conditions of existence
being generally favourable to life.

The tortoises which live on those islands where
there is no water, or in the lower and arid parts of the others,
feed chiefly on the succulent cactus.
Those which frequent the
higher and damp regions, eat the leaves of various trees, a kind
of berry (called guayavita) which is acid and austere, and like;

Near the springs it was a curious spectacle to
behold many of these huge creatures, one set eagerly travelling

having drunk their fill. When the tortoise arrives at the

the different islands, and that he could with certainty tell from
which island any one was brought. I did not for some time

and I had already parmingled together the collections from two of the islands.
I never dreamed that islands, about fifty or sixty miles apart, and
most of them in sight of each other, formed of precisely the same
rocks, placed under a quite similar climate, rising to a nearly
equal height, would have been differently tenanted but we shall
soon see that this is the case.
It is the fate of most voyagers, no
sooner to discover what is most interesting in any locality, than
they are hurried from it ; but I ought, perhaps, to be thankful
that I obtained sufficient materials to establish this most remarkable fact in the distribution of organic beings.

namely, Hood Island, as having their shells in front thick and
turned up like a Spanish saddle, whilst the tortoises from James
Island are rounder, blacker, and have a better taste when cooked.
M. Bibron, moreover, informs me that he has seen what he considers two distinct species of tortoise from the Galapagos, but he
does not know from which islands.
The specimens that I brought
from three islands were young ones ; and probably owing to this
cause, neither Mr. Gray nor myself could find in them any specific
differences.
I have remarked that the marine Amblyrhynchus
was larger at Albemarle Island than elsewhere and M. Bibron
informs me that he has seen two distinct aquatic species of this
genus so that the different islands probably have their representative species or races of the Amblyrhynchus, as well as of the
tortoise.
My attention was first thoroughly aroused, by comparing together the numerous specimens, shot by myself and several
other parties on board, of the mocking-thrushes, when, to my
astonishment, I discovered that all those from Charles Island

In the time of Pernety (1763), all the birds there appear to

wand he killed ten in half an hour. At that period the birds
must have been about as tame, as they now are at the Galapagos.

I may add that, according to Du Bois, all the birds at Bourbon in 1571-72, with the exception of the flamingoes and geese,
were so extremely tame, that they could be caught by the hand,

and not dependent on any general degree of caution arising from

secondly, that it is not acquired by individual birds in a short time, even when much persecuted
but
that in the course of successive generations it becomes hereditary.
With domesticated animals we are accustomed to see new mental
habits or instincts acquired and rendered hereditary
but with
animals in a state of nature, it must always be most difficult to
discover instances of acquired hereditary knowledge.
In regard
to the wildness of birds towards man, there is no way of accounting for it, except as an inherited habit comparatively few young
birds, in any one year, have been injured by man in England,
yet almost all, even nestlings, are afraid of him
many individuals, on the other hand, both at the Galapagos and at the Falklands, have been pursued and injured by man, but yet have not
learned a salutary dread of him. We may infer from these facts,
what havoc the introduction of any new beast of prey must cause
in a country, before the instincts of the indigenous inhabitants
have become adapted to the stranger's craft or power.

The land capable of cultivation, is scarcely in any part more

which encircles the entire line of coast. Within the reef there is an
expanse of smooth water, like that of a lake, where the canoes of
the natives can ply with safety and where ships anchor.

Tahitians, by climbing amongst these ledges, searching for fruit,
had discovered a track by which the whole precipice could be
scaled.
The first ascent from the valley was very dangerous ;
for it was necessary to pass a steeply-inclined face of naked rock,
by the aid of ropes which we brought with us. How any person
discovered that this formidable spot was the only point where
the side of the mountain was practicable, I cannot imagine.
We then cautiously walked along one of the ledges till we came
to one of the three streams.
This ledge formed a flat spot,
above which a beautiful cascade, some hundred feet in height,
poured down its waters, and beneath, another high cascade fell
into the main stream in the valley below.

I had been introduced to the Rev.

W. Williams, who, upon my expressing a wish, invited me to

to take me in his boat by a creek, where I should see a

likewise procured for me a guide.

there are three

Messrs. Williams, Davies, and

are the huts of the native labourers.
On an adjoining slope,
fine crops of
barley and wheat were standing in full ear ; and in
another part, fields of potatoes and clover. But I cannot

from one trifling anecdote, I should think they must be honest.

About a mile and a half from this place

Following
down a little valley and its tiny rill of water, an immense gulf

If we imagine a winding harbour, with
its deep water surrounded

and a forest to spring up on its sandy bottom, we should then
have the appearance and structure here exhibited. This kind of
view was to me quite novel, and extremely magnificent.
In the evening we reached the Blackheath. The sandstone
plateau has here attained the height of 3400 feet; and is covered,
as before, with the same
scrubby woods. From the road, there
were occasional glimpses into a profound valley, of the same character as the one described

Other similar cases might have been added.

The first impression, on seeing the correspondence of the horizontal strata on each side of these valleys and great amphitheatrical depressions, is that they have been hollowed out, like other
by the action of water but when one reflects on the enormous amount of stone, which on this view must have been removed through mere gorges or chasms, one is led to ask whether
these spaces may not have subsided.

Some of the inhabitants remarked to

the headlands receding on both hands, without being struck with
their resemblance to a bold sea-coast. This is certainly the case

stone coast-cliffs, varying from one mile in width to a quarter
of a mile, present a likeness, though on a miniature scale, to
the great valleys of the interior.
But then immediately occurs
the startling difficulty, why has the sea worn out these great,

though circumscribed depressions on a wide platform, and left
mere gorges at the openings, through which the whole vast amount
of triturated matter must have been carried away ? The only
light I can throw upon this enigma, is by remarking that banks
of the most irregular forms appear to be now forming in some
seas, as in parts of the West Indies and in the Red Sea, and that
their sides are exceedingly steep.
Such banks, I have been led

of spreading out sediment in a uniform sheet, heaps it round

happened to pay the settlement a visit while we were there.
These men, as well as those of the tribe belonging to King
George's Sound, being tempted by the offer of some tubs of rice
and sugar, were persuaded to hold a " corrobery," or great
dancing-party. As soon as it grew dark, small fires were lighted,
and the men commenced their toilet, which consisted in painting
themselves white in spots and lines.
As soon as all was ready,
large fires were kept blazing, round which the women and children were collected as spectators

George's men formed two distinct parties, and generally danced
in answer to each other. The dancing consisted in their running
either sideways or in Indian file into an open space, and stamping the ground with great force as they marched together. Their

their clubs and spears together, and by various other gesticula;

From the fact of the reef-building corals not living at great
depths, it is absolutely certain that throughout these vast areas,

wherever there

is

now an

atoll,

a foundation must have ori-

ginally existed within a depth of from 20 to 30 fathoms from the
surface.
It is improbable in the highest degree that broad,
lofty, isolated, steep-sided banks of sediment, arranged in groups
and lines hundreds of leagues in length, could have been depo-

the central and profoundest parts of the Pacific and
Indian Oceans, at an immense distance from any continent, and
where the water is perfectly limpid. It is equally improbable
that the elevatory forces should have uplifted throughout the
sited in

above vast areas, innumerable great rocky banks within 20 to 30
fathoms, or 120 to 180 feet, of the surface of the sea, and not
one single point above that level ; for where on the whole face
of the globe can we find a single chain of mountains, even a few
hundred miles in length, with their many summits rising within
a few feet of a given level, and not one pinnacle above it ? If
then the foundations, whence the atoll-building corals sprang,
were not formed of sediment, and if they were not lifted up to
the required level, they must of necessity have subsided into it;

as much as a mile from the land but in such cases the soundings

down could injure the corals on the reef. Now, every reef of

the fringing-class is breached by a narrow gateway in front of
the smallest rivulet, even if dry during the greater part of the
year, for the mud, sand, or gravel, occasionally washed down,
kills the corals on which it is deposited.
Consequently, when
an island thus fringed subsides, though most of the narrow gateways will probably become closed by the outward and upward
growth of the corals, yet any that are not closed (and some must
always be kept open by the sediment and impure water flowing

out of the lagoon-channel) will still continue to front exactly
the upper parts of those valleys, at the mouths of which the

whilst it has been slowly rising atolls and barrier-reefs, on the

According to my views, St.

Mr. Cuming, however, informs me

all the birds have been introduced within late years.

hence the variety
on the summit of the island differs from that on the coast. Of
native birds there are none ; but the guinea-fowl,

Some cats, which were originally turned
out to destroy the rats and mice, have increased, so as to become
a great plague.

From

the absence of all carbonaceous matter, Professor Ehrenberg believes that these organic bodies have passed through the
volcanic fire, and have been erupted in the state in which we
now see them. The appearance of the layers induced me to
believe that they had been deposited under water,

The flat swampy land on which Pernambuco stands is surrounded, at the distance of a few miles, by a semicircle of low
