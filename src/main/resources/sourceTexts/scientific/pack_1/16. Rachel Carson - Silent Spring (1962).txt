RACHEL
CARSON
Author of THE SEA AROUND US

SILENT SPRING, winner of 8 awards*, is the history making bestseller that
stunned the world with its terrifying revelation about our contaminated planet. No sciencefiction nightmare can equal the power of this authentic and chilling portrait of the un-seen
destroyers which have already begun to change the shape of life as we know it.
“Silent Spring is a devastating attack on human carelessness, greed and
irresponsibility. It should be read by every American who does not want it to be the epitaph of
a world not very far beyond us in time.”
--- Saturday Review

IN A LETTER written in January 1958, Olga Owens Huckins told me of her own bitter
experience of a small world made lifeless, and so brought my attention sharply back to a
problem with which I had long been concerned. I then realized I must write this book.
During the years since then I have received help and encouragement from so many people that
it is not possible to name them all here. Those who have freely shared with me the fruits of
many years’ experience and study represent a wide variety of government agencies in this and
other countries, many universities and research institutions, and many professions. To all of
them I express my deepest thanks for time and thought so generously given.
In addition my special gratitude goes to those who took time to read portions of the manuscript
and to offer comment and criticism based on their own expert knowledge. Although the final
responsibility for the accuracy and validity of the text is mine, I could not have completed the
book without the generous help of these specialists: L. G. Bartholomew, M.D., of the Mayo
Clinic, John J. Biesele of the University of Texas, A. W. A. Brown of the University of Western
Ontario, Morton S. Biskind, M.D., of Westport, Connecticut, C. J. Briejer of the Plant Protection
Service in Holland, Clarence Cottam of the Rob and Bessie Welder Wildlife Foundation, George
Crile, Jr., M.D., of the Cleveland Clinic, Frank Egler of Norfolk, Connecticut, Malcolm M.
Hargraves, M.D., of the Mayo Clinic, W. C. Hueper, M.D., of the National Cancer Institute, C. J.
Kerswill of the Fisheries Research Board of Canada, Olaus Murie of the Wilderness Society, A. D.
Pickett of the Canada Department of Agriculture, Thomas G. Scott of the Illinois Natural History
Survey, Clarence Tarzwell of the Taft Sanitary Engineering Center, and George J. Wallace of
Michigan State University. Every writer of a book based on many diverse facts owes much to
the skill and helpfulness of librarians. I owe such a debt to many, but especially to Ida K.
Johnston of the Department of the Interior Library and to Thelma Robinson of the Library of the
National Institutes of Health.
As my editor, Paul Brooks has given steadfast encouragement over the years and has
cheerfully accommodated his plans to postponements and delays. For this, and for his skilled
editorial judgment, I am everlastingly grateful. I have had capable and devoted assistance in the
enormous task of library research from Dorothy Algire, Jeanne Davis, and Bette Haney Duff.
And I could not possibly have completed the task, under circumstances sometimes difficult,
except for the faithful help of my housekeeper, Ida Sprow.
Finally, I must acknowledge our vast indebtedness to a host of people, many of them
unknown to me personally, who have nevertheless made the writing of this book seem
worthwhile. These are the people who first spoke out against the reckless and irresponsible
poisoning of the world that man shares with all other creatures, and who are even now fighting
the thousands of small battles that in the end will bring victory for sanity and common sense in
our accommodation to the world that surrounds us.

Foreword
IN 1958, when Rachel Carson undertook to write the book that became Silent Spring,
she was fifty years old. She had spent most of her professional life as a marine biologist and
writer with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. But now she was a world-famous author, thanks
to the fabulous success of The Sea Around Us, published seven years before. Royalties from this
book and its successor, The Edge of the Sea, had enabled her to devote full time to her own
writing. To most authors this would seem like an ideal situation: an established reputation,
freedom to choose one’s own subject, publishers more than ready to contract for anything one
wrote. It might have been assumed that her next book would be in a field that offered the same
opportunities, the same joy in research, as did its predecessors. Indeed she had such projects in
mind. But it was not to be. While working for the government, she and her scientific colleagues
had become alarmed by the widespread use of DDT and other long-lasting poisons in so-called
agricultural control programs. Immediately after the war, when these dangers had already been
recognized, she had tried in vain to interest some magazine in an article on the subject. A
decade later, when the spraying of pesticides and herbicides (some of them many times as toxic
as DDT) was causing wholesale destruction of wildlife and its habitat, and clearly endangering
human life, she decided she had to speak out. Again she tried to interest the magazines in an
article. Though by now she was a well-known writer, the magazine publishers, fearing to lose
advertising, turned her down. For example, a manufacturer of canned baby food claimed that
such an article would cause “unwarranted fear” to mothers who used his product. (The one
exception was The New Yorker, which would later serialize parts of Silent Spring in advance of
book publication.) So the only answer was to write a book—book publishers being free of
advertising pressure. Miss Carson tried to find someone else to write it, but at last she decided
that if it were to be done, she would have to do it herself. Many of her strongest admirers
questioned whether she could write a salable book on such a dreary subject. She shared their
doubts, but she went ahead because she had to. “There would be no peace for me,” she wrote
to a friend, “if I kept silent.”
Silent Spring was over four years in the making. It required a very different kind of
research from her previous books. She could no longer recount the delights of the laboratories
at Woods Hole or of the marine rock pools at low tide. Joy in the subject itself had to be
replaced by a sense of almost religious dedication. And extraordinary courage: during the final
years she was plagued with what she termed “a whole catalogue of illnesses.”
Also she knew very well that she would be attacked by the chemical industry. It was not simply
that she was opposing indiscriminate use of poisons but—more fundamentally—that she had
made clear the basic irresponsibility of an industrialized, technological society toward the
natural world. When the attack did come, it was probably as bitter and unscrupulous as
anything of the sort since the publication of Charles Darwin’s Origin of Species a century before.
Hundreds of thousands of dollars were spent by the chemical industry in an attempt to
discredit the book and to malign the author—she was described as an ignorant and hysterical
woman who wanted to turn the earth over to the insects. These attacks fortunately backfired
by creating more publicity than the publisher possibly could have afforded. A major chemical

company tried to stop publication on the grounds that Miss Carson had made a misstatement
about one of their products. She hadn’t, and publication proceeded on schedule.
She herself was singularly unmoved by all this furor.
Meanwhile, as a direct result of the message in Silent Spring, President Kennedy set up a
special panel of his Science Advisory Committee to study the problem of pesticides. The panel’s
report, when it appeared some months later, was a complete vindication of her thesis. Rachel
Carson was very modest about her accomplishment. As she wrote to a close friend when the
manuscript was nearing completion: “The beauty of the living world I was trying to save has
always been uppermost in my mind—that, and anger at the senseless, brutish things that were
being done.... Now l can believe I have at least helped a little.” In fact, her book helped to make
ecology, which was an unfamiliar word in those days, one of the great popular causes of our
time. It led to environmental legislation at every level of government.
Twenty-five years after its original publication, Silent Spring has more than a historical
interest. Such a book bridges the gulf between what C. P. Snow called “the two cultures.”
Rachel Carson was a realistic, well-trained scientist who possessed the insight and sensitivity of
a poet. She had an emotional response to nature for which she did not apologize. The more she
learned, the greater grew what she termed “the sense of wonder.” So she succeeded in making
a book about death a celebration of life. Rereading her book today, one is aware that its
implications are far broader than the immediate crisis with which it dealt. By awaking us to a
specific danger—the poisoning of the earth with chemicals—she has helped us to recognize
many other ways (some little known in her time) in which mankind is degrading the quality of
life on our planet.
And Silent Spring will continue to remind us that in our over-organized and overmechanized age, individual initiative and courage still count: change can be brought about, not
through incitement to war or violent revolution, but rather by altering the direction of our
thinking about the world we live in.

1. A Fable for Tomorrow
THERE WAS ONCE a town in the heart of America where all life seemed to live in
harmony with its surroundings. The town lay in the midst of a checkerboard of prosperous
farms, with fields of grain and hillsides of orchards where, in spring, white clouds of bloom
drifted above the green fields. In autumn, oak and maple and birch set up a blaze of color that
flamed and flickered across a backdrop of pines. Then foxes barked in the hills and deer silently
crossed the fields, half hidden in the mists of the fall mornings.
Along the roads, laurel, viburnum and alder, great ferns and wildflowers delighted the traveler’s
eye through much of the year. Even in winter the roadsides were places of beauty, where
countless birds came to feed on the berries and on the seed heads of the dried weeds rising
above the snow. The countryside was, in fact, famous for the abundance and variety of its bird
life, and when the flood of migrants was pouring through in spring and fall people traveled from
great distances to observe them. Others came to fish the streams, which flowed clear and cold
out of the hills and contained shady pools where trout lay. So it had been from the days many
years ago when the first settlers raised their houses, sank their wells, and built their barns.
Then a strange blight crept over the area and everything began to change. Some evil spell had
settled on the community: mysterious maladies swept the flocks of chickens; the cattle and
sheep sickened and died. Everywhere was a shadow of death. The farmers spoke of much
illness among their families. In the town the doctors had become more and more puzzled by
new kinds of sickness appearing among their patients. There had been several sudden and
unexplained deaths, not only among adults but even among children, who would be stricken
suddenly while at play and die within a few hours.
There was a strange stillness. The birds, for example—where had they gone? Many people
spoke of them, puzzled and disturbed. The feeding stations in the backyards were deserted. The
few birds seen anywhere were moribund; they trembled violently and could not fly. It was a
spring without voices. On the mornings that had once throbbed with the dawn chorus of robins,
catbirds, doves, jays, wrens, and scores of other bird voices there was now no sound; only
silence lay over the fields and woods and marsh.
On the farms the hens brooded, but no chicks hatched. The farmers complained that they were
unable to raise any pigs—the litters were small and the young survived only a few days. The
apple trees were coming into bloom but no bees droned among the blossoms, so there was no
pollination and there would be no fruit. The roadsides, once so attractive, were now lined with
browned and withered vegetation as though swept by fire. These, too, were silent, deserted by
all living things. Even the streams were now lifeless. Anglers no longer visited them, for all the
fish had died.
In the gutters under the eaves and between the shingles of the roofs, a white granular powder
still showed a few patches; some weeks before it had fallen like snow upon the roofs and the
lawns, the fields and streams. No witchcraft, no enemy action had silenced the rebirth of new
life in this stricken world. The people had done it themselves.
. . .This town does not actually exist, but it might easily have a thousand counterparts in
America or elsewhere in the world. I know of no community that has experienced all the

misfortunes I describe. Yet every one of these disasters has actually happened somewhere, and
many real communities have already suffered a substantial number of them. A grim specter
has crept upon us almost unnoticed, and this imagined tragedy may easily become a stark
reality we all shall know. What has already silenced the voices of spring in countless towns in
America? This book is an attempt to explain.

2. The Obligation to Endure
THE HISTORY OF LIFE on earth has been a history of interaction between living things
and their surroundings. To a large extent, the physical form and the habits of the earth’s
vegetation and its animal life have been molded by the environment. Considering the whole
span of earthly time, the opposite effect, in which life actually modifies its surroundings, has
been relatively slight. Only within the moment of time represented by the present century has
one species—man—acquired significant power to alter the nature of his world.
During the past quarter century this power has not only increased to one of disturbing
magnitude but it has changed in character. The most alarming of all man’s assaults upon the
environment is the contamination of air, earth, rivers, and sea with dangerous and even lethal
materials. This pollution is for the most part irrecoverable; the chain of evil it initiates not
only in the world that must support life but in living tissues is for the most part irreversible. In
this now universal contamination of the environment, chemicals are the sinister and littlerecognized partners of radiation in changing the very nature of the world—the very nature of
its life. Strontium 90, released through nuclear explosions into the air, comes to earth in rain or
drifts down as fallout, lodges in soil, enters into the grass or corn or wheat grown there, and in
time takes up its abode in the bones of a human being, there to remain until his death.
Similarly, chemicals sprayed on croplands or forests or gardens lie long in soil, entering into
living organisms, passing from one to another in a chain of poisoning and death. Or they pass
mysteriously by underground streams until they emerge and, through the alchemy of air and
sunlight, combine into new forms that kill vegetation, sicken cattle, and work unknown harm on
those who drink from once pure wells. As Albert Schweitzer has said, ‘Man can hardly even
recognize the devils of his own creation.’ It took hundreds of millions of years to produce the
life that now inhabits the earth—eons of time in which that developing and evolving and
diversifying life reached a state of adjustment and balance with its surroundings. The
environment, rigorously shaping and directing the life it supported, contained elements that
were hostile as well as supporting. Certain rocks gave out dangerous radiation; even within the
light of the sun, from which all life draws its energy, there were short-wave radiations with
power to injure. Given time—time not in years but in millennia—life adjusts, and a balance has
been reached. For time is the essential ingredient; but in the modern world there is no time.
The rapidity of change and the speed with which new situations are created follow the
impetuous and heedless pace of man rather than the deliberate pace of nature. Radiation is no
longer merely the background radiation of rocks, the bombardment of cosmic rays, the
ultraviolet of the sun that have existed before there was any life on earth; radiation is now the
unnatural creation of man’s tampering with the atom. The chemicals to which life is asked to
make its adjustment are no longer merely the calcium and silica and copper and all the rest of
the minerals washed out of the rocks and carried in rivers to the sea; they are the synthetic
creations of man’s inventive mind, brewed in his laboratories, and having no counterparts in
nature.
To adjust to these chemicals would require time on the scale that is nature’s; it would require
not merely the years of a man’s life but the life of generations. And even this, were it by some
miracle possible, would be futile, for the new chemicals come from our laboratories in an

endless stream; almost five hundred annually find their way into actual use in the United States
alone. The figure is staggering and its implications are not easily grasped—500 new chemicals
to which the bodies of men and animals are required somehow to adapt each year, chemicals
totally outside the limits of biologic experience.
Among them are many that are used in man’s war against nature. Since the mid-1940s over 200
basic chemicals have been created for use in killing insects, weeds, rodents, and other
organisms described in the modern vernacular as ‘pests’; and they are sold under several
thousand different brand names. These sprays, dusts, and aerosols are now applied almost
universally to farms, gardens, forests, and homes— nonselective chemicals that have the power
to kill every insect, the ‘good’ and the ‘bad’, to still the song of birds and the leaping of fish in
the streams, to coat the leaves with a deadly film, and to linger on in soil—all this though the
intended target may be only a few weeds or insects. Can anyone believe it is possible to lay
down such a barrage of poisons on the surface of the earth without making it unfit for all life?
They should not be called ‘insecticides’, but ‘biocides’. The whole process of spraying seems
caught up in an endless spiral. Since DDT was released for civilian use, a process of escalation
has been going on in which ever more toxic materials must be found. This has happened
because insects, in a triumphant vindication of Darwin’s principle of the survival of the fittest,
have evolved super races immune to the particular insecticide used, hence a deadlier one has
always to be developed—and then a deadlier one than that. It has happened also because, for
reasons to be described later, destructive insects often undergo a ‘flareback’, or resurgence,
after spraying, in numbers greater than before. Thus the chemical war is never won, and all life
is caught in its violent crossfire.
Along with the possibility of the extinction of mankind by nuclear war, the central problem of
our age has therefore become the contamination of man’s total environment with such
substances of incredible potential for harm—substances that accumulate in the tissues of
plants and animals and even penetrate the germ cells to shatter or alter the very material
of heredity upon which the shape of the future depends.
Some would-be architects of our future look toward a time when it will be possible to alter the
human germ plasm by design. But we may easily be doing so now by inadvertence, for many
chemicals, like radiation, bring about gene mutations. It is ironic to think that man might
determine his own future by something so seemingly trivial as the choice of an insect spray.
All this has been risked—for what? Future historians may well be amazed by our distorted
sense of proportion. How could intelligent beings seek to control a few unwanted species by a
method that contaminated the entire environment and brought the threat of disease and death
even to their own kind? Yet this is precisely what we have done. We have done it, moreover,
for reasons that collapse the moment we examine them. We are told that the enormous and
expanding use of pesticides is necessary to maintain farm production. Yet is our real problem
not one of overproduction? Our farms, despite measures to remove acreages from production
and to pay farmers not to produce, have yielded such a staggering excess of crops that the
American taxpayer in 1962 is paying out more than one billion dollars a year as the total
carrying cost of the surplus-food storage program. And is the situation helped when one branch
of the Agriculture Department tries to reduce production while another states, as it did in 1958,
‘It is believed generally that reduction of crop acreages under provisions of the Soil Bank will
stimulate interest in use of chemicals to obtain maximum production on the land retained in

crops.’ All this is not to say there is no insect problem and no need of control. I am saying,
rather, that control must be geared to realities, not to mythical situations, and that the
methods employed must be such that they do not destroy us along with the insects.
. . . The problem whose attempted solution has brought such a train of disaster in its wake is an
accompaniment of our modern way of life. Long before the age of man, insects inhabited the
earth—a group of extraordinarily varied and adaptable beings. Over the course of time since
man’s advent, a small percentage of the more than half a million species of insects have come
into conflict with human welfare in two principal ways: as competitors for the food supply and
as carriers of human disease. Disease-carrying insects become important where human beings
are crowded together, especially under conditions where sanitation is poor, as in time of
natural disaster or war or in situations of extreme poverty and deprivation. Then control of
some sort becomes necessary. It is a sobering fact, however, as we shall presently see, that the
method of massive chemical control has had only limited success, and also threatens to worsen
the very conditions it is intended to curb.
Under primitive agricultural conditions the farmer had few insect problems. These arose with
the intensification of agriculture—the devotion of immense acreages to a single crop. Such a
system set the stage for explosive increases in specific insect populations. Single-crop farming
does not take advantage of the principles by which nature works; it is agriculture as an engineer
might conceive it to be. Nature has introduced great variety into the landscape, but man has
displayed a passion for simplifying it. Thus he undoes the built-in checks and balances by which
nature holds the species within bounds. One important natural check is a limit on the amount
of suitable habitat for each species. Obviously then, an insect that lives on wheat can build up
its population to much higher levels on a farm devoted to wheat than on one in which wheat is
intermingled with other crops to which the insect is not adapted. The same thing happens in
other situations. A generation or more ago, the towns of large areas of the United States lined
their streets with the noble elm tree. Now the beauty they hopefully created is threatened with
complete destruction as disease sweeps through the elms, carried by a beetle that would have
only limited chance to build up large populations and to spread from tree to tree if the elms
were only occasional trees in a richly diversified planting.
Another factor in the modern insect problem is one that must be viewed against a background
of geologic and human history: the spreading of thousands of different kinds of organisms from
their native homes to invade new territories. This worldwide migration has been studied and
graphically described by the British ecologist Charles Elton in his recent book The Ecology of
Invasions. During the Cretaceous Period, some hundred million years ago, flooding seas cut
many land bridges between continents and living things found themselves confined in what
Elton calls ‘colossal separate nature reserves’. There, isolated from others of their kind, they
developed many new species. When some of the land masses were joined again, about 15
million years ago, these species began to move out into new territories—a movement that is
not only still in progress but is now receiving considerable assistance from man.
The importation of plants is the primary agent in the modern spread of species, for animals
have almost invariably gone along with the plants, quarantine being a comparatively recent and
not completely effective innovation. The United States Office of Plant Introduction alone has
introduced almost 200,000 species and varieties of plants from all over the world. Nearly half of
the 180 or so major insect enemies of plants in the United States are accidental imports from

abroad, and most of them have come as hitchhikers on plants. In new territory, out of reach of
the restraining hand of the natural enemies that kept down its numbers in its native land, an
invading plant or animal is able to become enormously abundant. Thus it is no accident that our
most troublesome insects are introduced species. These invasions, both the naturally occurring
and those dependent on human assistance, are likely to continue indefinitely. Quarantine and
massive chemical campaigns are only extremely expensive ways of buying time. We are faced,
according to Dr. Elton, ‘with a life-and-death need not just to find new technological means of
suppressing this plant or that animal’; instead we need the basic knowledge of animal
populations and their relations to their surroundings that will ‘promote an even balance and
damp down the explosive power of outbreaks and new invasions.’
Much of the necessary knowledge is now available but we do not use it. We train ecologists in
our universities and even employ them in our governmental agencies but we seldom take their
advice. We allow the chemical death rain to fall as though there were no alternative, whereas
in fact there are many, and our ingenuity could soon discover many more if given opportunity.
Have we fallen into a mesmerized state that makes us accept as inevitable that which is inferior
or detrimental, as though having lost the will or the vision to demand that which is good? Such
thinking, in the words of the ecologist Paul Shepard, ‘idealizes life with only its head out of
water, inches above the limits of toleration of the corruption of its own environment...Why
should we tolerate a diet of weak poisons, a home in insipid surroundings, a circle of
acquaintances who are not quite our enemies, the noise of motors with just enough relief to
prevent insanity? Who would want to live in a world which is just not quite fatal?’
Yet such a world is pressed upon us. The crusade to create a chemically sterile, insect-free
world seems to have engendered a fanatic zeal on the part of many specialists and most of the
so-called control agencies. On every hand there is evidence that those engaged in spraying
operations exercise a ruthless power. ‘The regulatory entomologists...function as prosecutor,
judge and jury, tax assessor and collector and sheriff to enforce their own orders,’ said
Connecticut entomologist Neely Turner. The most flagrant abuses go unchecked in both state
and federal agencies. It is not my contention that chemical insecticides must never be used. I do
contend that we have put poisonous and biologically potent chemicals indiscriminately into the
hands of persons largely or wholly ignorant of their potentials for harm. We have subjected
enormous numbers of people to contact with these poisons, without their consent and often
without their knowledge. If the Bill of Rights contains no guarantee that a citizen shall be secure
against lethal poisons distributed either by private individuals or by public officials, it is surely
only because our forefathers, despite their considerable wisdom and foresight, could conceive
of no such problem.
I contend, furthermore, that we have allowed these chemicals to be used with little or no
advance investigation of their effect on soil, water, wildlife, and man himself. Future
generations are unlikely to condone our lack of prudent concern for the integrity of the natural
world that supports all life. There is still very limited awareness of the nature of the threat. This
is an era of specialists, each of whom sees his own problem and is unaware of or intolerant of
the larger frame into which it fits. It is also an era dominated by industry, in which the right to
make a dollar at whatever cost is seldom challenged. When the public protests, confronted with
some obvious evidence of damaging results of pesticide applications, it is fed little tranquilizing
pills of half truth. We urgently need an end to these false assurances, to the sugar coating of

unpalatable facts. It is the public that is being asked to assume the risks that the insect
controllers calculate. The public must decide whether it wishes to continue on the present
road, and it can do so only when in full possession of the facts. In the words of Jean Rostand,
‘The obligation to endure gives us the right to know.’

3. Elixirs of Death
FOR THE FIRST TIME in the history of the world, every human being is now subjected to
contact with dangerous chemicals, from the moment of conception until death. In the less than
two decades of their use, the synthetic pesticides have been so thoroughly distributed
throughout the animate and inanimate world that they occur virtually everywhere. They have
been recovered from most of the major river systems and even from streams of groundwater
flowing unseen through the earth. Residues of these chemicals linger in soil to which they may
have been applied a dozen years before. They have entered and lodged in the bodies of fish,
birds, reptiles, and domestic and wild animals so universally that scientists carrying on animal
experiments find it almost impossible to locate subjects free from such contamination. They
have been found in fish in remote mountain lakes, in earthworms burrowing in soil, in the eggs
of birds—and in man himself. For these chemicals are now stored in the bodies of the vast
majority of human beings, regardless of age. They occur in the mother’s milk, and probably in
the tissues of the unborn child. All this has come about because of the sudden rise and
prodigious growth of an industry for the production of manmade or synthetic chemicals with
insecticidal properties. This industry is a child of the Second World War. In the course of
developing agents of chemical warfare, some of the chemicals created in the laboratory were
found to be lethal to insects. The discovery did not come by chance: insects were widely used
to test chemicals as agents of death for man. The result has been a seemingly endless stream of
synthetic insecticides. In being man-made—by ingenious laboratory manipulation of the
molecules, substituting atoms, altering their arrangement—they differ sharply from the simpler
insecticides of prewar days. These were derived from naturally occurring minerals and plant
products—compounds of arsenic, copper, , manganese, zinc, and other minerals, pyrethrum
from the dried flowers of chrysanthemums, nicotine sulphate from some of the relatives of
tobacco, and rotenone from leguminous plants of the East Indies.
What sets the new synthetic insecticides apart is their enormous biological potency. They have
immense power not merely to poison but to enter into the most vital processes of the body and
change them in sinister and often deadly ways. Thus, as we shall see, they destroy the very
enzymes whose function is to protect the body from harm, they block the oxidation processes
from which the body receives its energy, they prevent the normal functioning of various organs,
and they may initiate in certain cells the slow and irreversible change that leads to malignancy.
Yet new and more deadly chemicals are added to the list each year and new uses are devised so
that contact with these materials has become practically worldwide. The production of
synthetic pesticides in the United States soared from 124,259,000 pounds in 1947 to
637,666,000 pounds in 1960—more than a fivefold increase. The wholesale value of these
products was well over a quarter of a billion dollars. But in the plans and hopes of the industry
this enormous production is only a beginning.
A Who’s Who of pesticides is therefore of concern to us all. If we are going to live so intimately
with these chemicals—eating and drinking them, taking them into the very marrow of our
bones—we had better know something about their nature and their power. Although the
Second World War marked a turning away from inorganic chemicals as pesticides into the
wonder world of the carbon molecule, a few of the old materials persist. Chief among these is

arsenic, which is still the basic ingredient in a variety of weed and insect killers. Arsenic is a
highly toxic mineral occurring widely in association with the ores of various metals, and in very
small amounts in volcanoes, in the sea, and in spring water. Its relations to man are varied and
historic. Since many of its compounds are tasteless, it has been a favorite agent of homicide
from long before the time of the Borgias to the present. Arsenic is present in English chimney
soot and along with certain aromatic hydrocarbons is considered responsible for the
carcinogenic (or cancer-causing) action of the soot, which was recognized nearly two centuries
ago by an English physician. Epidemics of chronic arsenical poisoning involving whole
populations over long periods are on record. Arsenic-contaminated environments have also
caused sickness and death among horses, cows, goats, pigs, deer, fishes, and bees; despite this
record arsenical sprays and dusts are widely used. In the arsenic-sprayed cotton country of
southern United States beekeeping as an industry has nearly died out. Farmers using arsenic
dusts over long periods have been afflicted with chronic arsenic poisoning, livestock have been
poisoned by crop sprays or weed killers containing arsenic. Drifting arsenic dusts from
blueberry lands have spread over neighboring farms, contaminating streams, fatally poisoning
bees and cows, and causing human illness. ‘It is scarcely possible...to handle arsenicals with
more utter disregard of the general health than that which has been practiced in our country in
recent years,’ said Dr. W. C. Hueper, of the National Cancer Institute, an authority on
environmental cancer. ‘Anyone who has watched the dusters and sprayers of arsenical
insecticides at work must have been impressed by the almost supreme carelessness with which
the poisonous substances are dispensed.’ . . .
Modern insecticides are still more deadly. The vast majority fall into one of two large groups of
chemicals. One, represented by DDT, is known as the ‘chlorinated hydrocarbons. The other
group consists of the organic phosphorus insecticides, and is represented by the reasonably
familiar malathion and parathion. All have one thing in common. As mentioned above, they are
built on a basis of carbon atoms, which are also the indispensable building blocks of the living
world, and thus classed as ‘organic’. To understand them, we must see of what they are made,
and how, although linked with the basic chemistry of all life, they lend themselves to the
modifications which make them agents of death.
The basic element, carbon, is one whose atoms have an almost infinite capacity for uniting with
each other in chains and rings and various other configurations, and for becoming linked with
atoms of other substances. Indeed, the incredible diversity of living creatures from bacteria to
the great blue whale is largely due to this capacity of carbon. The complex protein molecule has
the carbon atom as its basis, as have molecules of fat, carbohydrates, enzymes, and vitamins.
So, too, have enormous numbers of nonliving things, for carbon is not necessarily a symbol of
life. Some organic compounds are simply combinations of carbon and hydrogen. The simplest
of these is methane, or marsh gas, formed in nature by the bacterial decomposition of organic
matter under water. Mixed with air in proper proportions, methane becomes the dreaded ‘fire
damp’ of coal mines. Its structure is beautifully simple, consisting of one carbon atom to which

four hydrogen atoms have become attached:

Chemists have discovered that it is possible to detach one or all of the hydrogen atoms and
substitute other elements. For example, by substituting one atom of chlorine for one of
hydrogen we produce methyl chloride:

Take away three hydrogen atoms and substitute chlorine and we have the anesthetic
chloroform:

Substitute chlorine atoms for all of the hydrogen atoms and the result is carbon tetrachloride,
the familiar cleaning fluid:

In the simplest possible terms, these changes rung upon the basic molecule of methane
illustrate what a chlorinated hydrocarbon is. But this illustration gives little hint of the true
complexity of the chemical world of the hydrocarbons, or of the manipulations by which the
organic chemist creates his infinitely varied materials. For instead of the simple methane
molecule with its single carbon atom, he may work with hydrocarbon molecules consisting of
many carbon atoms, arranged in rings or chains, with side chains or branches, holding to
themselves with chemical bonds not merely simple atoms of hydrogen or chlorine but also a
wide variety of chemical groups. By seemingly slight changes the whole character of the
substance is changed; for example, not only what is attached but the place of attachment to

the carbon atom is highly important. Such ingenious manipulations have produced a battery of
poisons of truly extraordinary power. . . .
DDT (short for dichloro-diphenyl-trichloro-ethane) was first synthesized by a German chemist in
1874, but its properties as an insecticide were not discovered until 1939. Almost immediately
DDT was hailed as a means of stamping out insect-borne disease and winning the farmers’ war
against crop destroyers overnight. The discoverer, Paul Müller of Switzerland, won the Nobel
Prize. DDT is now so universally used that in most minds the product takes on the harmless
aspect of the familiar. Perhaps the myth of the harmlessness of DDT rests on the fact that one
of its first uses was the wartime dusting of many thousands of soldiers, refugees, and prisoners,
to combat lice. It is widely believed that since so many people came into extremely intimate
contact with DDT and suffered no immediate ill effects the chemical must certainly be innocent
of harm. This understandable misconception arises from the fact that—unlike other chlorinated
hydrocarbons—DDT in powder form is not readily absorbed through the skin. Dissolved in oil, as
it usually is, DDT is definitely toxic. If swallowed, it is absorbed slowly through the digestive
tract; it may also be absorbed through the lungs. Once it has entered the body it is stored
largely in organs rich in fatty substances (because DDT itself is fat-soluble) such as the adrenals,
testes, or thyroid. Relatively large amounts are deposited in the liver, kidneys, and the fat of the
large, protective mesenteries that enfold the intestines.
This storage of DDT begins with the smallest conceivable intake of the chemical (which is
present as residues on most foodstuffs) and continues until quite high levels are reached. The
fatty storage depots act as biological magnifiers, so that an intake of as little as of 1 part per
million in the diet results in storage of about 10 to 15 parts per million, an increase of one
hundredfold or more. These terms of reference, so commonplace to the chemist or the
pharmacologist, are unfamiliar to most of us. One part in a million sounds like a very small
amount—and so it is. But such substances are so potent that a minute quantity can bring about
vast changes in the body. In animal experiments, 3 parts per million has been found to inhibit
an essential enzyme in heart muscle; only 5 parts per million has brought about necrosis or
disintegration of liver cells; only 2.5 parts per million of the closely related chemicals dieldrin
and chlordane did the same. This is really not surprising. In the normal chemistry of the human
body there is just such a disparity between cause and effect. For example, a quantity of iodine
as small as two ten-thousandths of a gram spells the difference between health and disease.
Because these small amounts of pesticides are cumulatively stored and only slowly excreted,
the threat of chronic poisoning and degenerative changes of the liver and other organs is very
real.
Scientists do not agree upon how much DDT can be stored in the human body. Dr. Arnold
Lehman, who is the chief pharmacologist of the Food and Drug Administration, says there is
neither a floor below which DDT is not absorbed nor a ceiling beyond which absorption and
storage ceases. On the other hand, Dr. Wayland Hayes of the United States Public Health
Service contends that in every individual a point of equilibrium is reached, and that DDT in
excess of this amount is excreted. For practical purposes it is not particularly important which
of these men is right. Storage in human beings has been well investigated, and we know that
the average person is storing potentially harmful amounts. According to various studies,
individuals with no known exposure (except the inevitable dietary one) store an average of 5.3
parts per million to 7.4 parts per million; agricultural workers 17.1 parts per million; and

workers in insecticide plants as high as 648 parts per million! So the range of proven storage is
quite wide and, what is even more to the point, the minimum figures are above the level at
which damage to the liver and other organs or tissues may begin. One of the most sinister
features of DDT and related chemicals is the way they are passed on from one organism to
another through all the links of the food chains. For example, fields of alfalfa are dusted with
DDT; meal is later prepared from the alfalfa and fed to hens; the hens lay eggs which contain
DDT. Or the hay, containing residues of 7 to 8 parts per million, may be fed to cows. The DDT
will turn up in the milk in the amount of about 3 parts per million, but in butter made from this
milk the concentration may run to 65 parts per million. Through such a process of transfer,
what started out as a very small amount of DDT may end as a heavy concentration. Farmers
nowadays find it difficult to obtain uncontaminated fodder for their milk cows, though the Food
and Drug Administration forbids the presence of insecticide residues in milk shipped in
interstate commerce.
The poison may also be passed on from mother to offspring. Insecticide residues have been
recovered from human milk in samples tested by Food and Drug Administration scientists. This
means that the breast-fed human infant is receiving small but regular additions to the load of
toxic chemicals building up in his body. It is by no means his first exposure, however: there is
good reason to believe this begins while he is still in the womb. In experimental animals the
chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticides freely cross the barrier of the placenta, the traditional
protective shield between the embryo and harmful substances in the mother’s body. While the
quantities so received by human infants would normally be small, they are not unimportant
because children are more susceptible to poisoning than adults. This situation also means that
today the average individual almost certainly starts life with the first deposit of the growing
load of chemicals his body will be required to carry thenceforth.
All these facts—storage at even low levels, subsequent accumulation, and occurrence of liver
damage at levels that may easily occur in normal diets, caused Food and Drug Administration
scientists to declare as early as 1950 that it is ‘extremely likely the potential hazard of DDT has
been underestimated.’ There has been no such parallel situation in medical history. No one yet
knows what the ultimate consequences may be. . . .
Chlordane, another chlorinated hydrocarbon, has all these unpleasant attributes of DDT plus a
few that are peculiarly its own. Its residues are long persistent in soil, on foodstuffs, or on
surfaces to which it may be applied. Chlordane makes use of all available portals to enter the
body. It may be absorbed through the skin, may be breathed in as a spray or dust, and of course
is absorbed from the digestive tract if residues are swallowed. Like all other chlorinated
hydrocarbons, its deposits build up in the body in cumulative fashion. A diet containing such a
small amount of chlordane as 2.5 parts per million may eventually lead to storage of 75 parts
per million in the fat of experimental animals. So experienced a pharmacologist as Dr. Lehman
has described chlordane in 1950 as ‘one of the most toxic of insecticides—anyone handling it
could be poisoned.’ Judging by the carefree liberality with which dusts for lawn treatments by
suburbanites are laced with chlordane, this warning has not been taken to heart. The fact that
the suburbanite is not instantly stricken has little meaning, for the toxins may sleep long in his
body, to become manifest months or years later in an obscure disorder almost impossible to
trace to its origins. On the other hand, death may strike quickly. One victim who accidentally
spilled a 25 per cent industrial solution on the skin developed symptoms of poisoning within 40

minutes and died before medical help could be obtained. No reliance can be placed on
receiving advance warning which might allow treatment to be had in time.
Heptachlor, one of the constituents of chlordane, is marketed as a separate formulation. It has
a particularly high capacity for storage in fat. If the diet contains as little as of 1 part per million
there will be measurable amounts of heptachlor in the body. It also has the curious ability to
undergo change into a chemically distinct substance known as heptachlor epoxide. It does this
in soil and in the tissues of both plants and animals. Tests on birds indicate that the epoxide
that results from this change is more toxic than the original chemical, which in turn is four times
as toxic as chlordane. As long ago as the mid-1930s a special group of hydrocarbons, the
chlorinated naphthalenes, was found to cause hepatitis, and also a rare and almost invariably
fatal liver disease in persons subjected to occupational exposure. They have led to illness and
death of workers in electrical industries; and more recently, in agriculture, they have been
considered a cause of a mysterious and usually fatal disease of cattle. In view of these
antecedents, it is not surprising that three of the insecticides that are related to this group are
among the most violently poisonous of all the hydrocarbons. These are dieldrin, aldrin, and
endrin. Dieldrin, named for a German chemist, Diels, is about 5 times as toxic as DDT when
swallowed but 40 times as toxic when absorbed through the skin in solution. It is notorious for
striking quickly and with terrible effect at the nervous system, sending the victims into
convulsions. Persons thus poisoned recover so slowly as to indicate chronic effects. As with
other chlorinated hydrocarbons, these long-term effects include severe damage to the liver.
The long duration of its residues and the effective insecticidal action make dieldrin one of the
most used insecticides today, despite the appalling destruction of wildlife that has followed its
use. As tested on quail and pheasants, it has proved to be about 40 to 50 times as toxic as DDT.
There are vast gaps in our knowledge of how dieldrin is stored or distributed in the body, or
excreted, for the chemists’ ingenuity in devising insecticides has long ago outrun biological
knowledge of the way these poisons affect the living organism. However, there is every
indication of long storage in the human body, where deposits may lie dormant like a slumbering
volcano, only to flare up in periods of physiological stress when the body draws upon its fat
reserves. Much of what we do know has been learned through hard experience in the
antimalarial campaigns carried out by the World Health Organization. As soon as dieldrin was
substituted for DDT in malaria-control work (because the malaria mosquitoes had become
resistant to DDT), cases of poisoning among the spraymen began to occur. The seizures were
severe—from half to all (varying in the different programs) of the men affected went into
convulsions and several died. Some had convulsions as long as four months after the last
exposure.
Aldrin is a somewhat mysterious substance, for although it exists as a separate entity it bears
the relation of alter ego to dieldrin. When carrots are taken from a bed treated with aldrin they
are found to contain residues of dieldrin. This change occurs in living tissues and also in soil.
Such alchemistic transformations have led to many erroneous reports, for if a chemist, knowing
aldrin has been applied, tests for it he will be deceived into thinking all residues have been
dissipated. The residues are there, but they are dieldrin and this requires a different test. Like
dieldrin, aldrin is extremely toxic. It produces degenerative changes in the liver and kidneys. A
quantity the size of an aspirin tablet is enough to kill more than 400 quail. Many cases of human
poisonings are on record, most of them in connection with industrial handling. Aldrin, like most

of this group of insecticides, projects a menacing shadow into the future, the shadow of
sterility. Pheasants fed quantities too small to kill them nevertheless laid few eggs, and the
chicks that hatched soon died. The effect is not confined to birds. Rats exposed to aldrin had
fewer pregnancies and their young were sickly and short-lived. Puppies born of treated mothers
died within three days. By one means or another, the new generations suffer for the poisoning
of their parents. No one knows whether the same effect will be seen in human beings, yet this
chemical has been sprayed from airplanes over suburban areas and farmlands.
Endrin is the most toxic of all the chlorinated hydrocarbons. Although chemically rather closely
related to dieldrin, a little twist in its molecular structure makes it 5 times as poisonous. It
makes the progenitor of all this group of insecticides, DDT, seem by comparison almost
harmless. It is 15 times as poisonous as DDT to mammals, 30 times as poisonous to fish, and
about 300 times as poisonous to some birds. In the decade of its use, endrin has killed
enormous numbers of fish, has fatally poisoned cattle that have wandered into sprayed
orchards, has poisoned wells, and has drawn a sharp warning from at least one state health
department that its careless use is endangering human lives. In one of the most tragic cases of
endrin poisoning there was no apparent carelessness; efforts had been made to take
precautions apparently considered adequate. A year-old child had been taken by his American
parents to live in Venezuela. There were cockroaches in the house to which they moved, and
after a few days a spray containing endrin was used. The baby and the small family dog were
taken out of the house before the spraying was done about nine o’clock one morning. After the
spraying the floors were washed. The baby and dog were returned to the house in
midafternoon. An hour or so later the dog vomited, went into convulsions, and died. At 10 p.m.
on the evening of the same day the baby also vomited, went into convulsions, and lost
consciousness. After that fateful contact with endrin this normal, healthy child became little
more than a vegetable—unable to see or hear, subject to frequent muscular spasms,
apparently completely cut off from contact with his surroundings. Several months of treatment
in a New York hospital failed to change his condition or bring hope of change. ‘It is extremely
doubtful,’ reported the attending physicians, ‘that any useful degree of recovery will occur.’ . . .
The second major group of insecticides, the alkyl or organic phosphates, are among the most
poisonous chemicals in the world. The chief and most obvious hazard attending their use is that
of acute poisoning of people applying the sprays or accidentally coming in contact with drifting
spray, with vegetation coated by it, or with a discarded container. In Florida, two children found
an empty bag and used it to repair a swing. Shortly thereafter both of them died and three of
their playmates became ill. The bag had once contained an insecticide called parathion, one of
the organic phosphates; tests established death by parathion poisoning. On another occasion
two small boys in Wisconsin, cousins, died on the same night. One had been playing in his yard
when spray drifted in from an adjoining field where his father was spraying potatoes with
parathion; the other had run playfully into the barn after his father and had put his hand on the
nozzle of the spray equipment.
The origin of these insecticides has a certain ironic significance. Although some of the chemicals
themselves—organic esters of phosphoric acid—had been known for many years, their
insecticidal properties remained to be discovered by a German chemist, Gerhard Schrader, in
the late 1930s. Almost immediately the German government recognized the value of these
same chemicals as new and devastating weapons in man’s war against his own kind, and the

work on them was declared secret. Some became the deadly nerve gases. Others, of closely
allied structure, became insecticides. The organic phosphorus insecticides act on the living
organism in a peculiar way. They have the ability to destroy enzymes—enzymes that perform
necessary functions in the body. Their target is the nervous system, whether the victim is an
insect or a warm-blooded animal. Under normal conditions, an impulse passes from nerve to
nerve with the aid of a ‘chemical transmitter’ called acetylcholine, a substance that performs an
essential function and then disappears. Indeed, its existence is so ephemeral that medical
researchers are unable, without special procedures, to sample it before the body has destroyed
it. This transient nature of the transmitting chemical is necessary to the normal functioning of
the body. If the acetylcholine is not destroyed as soon as a nerve impulse has passed, impulses
continue to flash across the bridge from nerve to nerve, as the chemical exerts its effects in an
ever more intensified manner. The movements of the whole body become uncoordinated:
tremors, muscular spasms, convulsions, and death quickly result. This contingency has been
provided for by the body. A protective enzyme called cholinesterase is at hand to destroy the
transmitting chemical once it is no longer needed. By this means a precise balance is struck and
the body never builds up a dangerous amount of acetylcholine. But on contact with the organic
phosphorus insecticides, the protective enzyme is destroyed, and as the quantity of the enzyme
is reduced that of the transmitting chemical builds up. In this effect, the organic phosphorus
compounds resemble the alkaloid poison muscarine, found in a poisonous mushroom, the fly
amanita.
Repeated exposures may lower the cholinesterase level until an individual reaches the brink of
acute poisoning, a brink over which he may be pushed by a very small additional exposure. For
this reason it is considered important to make periodic examinations of the blood of spray
operators and others regularly exposed. Parathion is one of the most widely used of the organic
phosphates. It is also one of the most powerful and dangerous. Honeybees become ‘wildly
agitated and bellicose’ on contact with it, perform frantic cleaning movements, and are near
death within half an hour. A chemist, thinking to learn by the most direct possible means the
dose acutely toxic to human beings, swallowed a minute amount, equivalent to about .00424
ounce. Paralysis followed so instantaneously that he could not reach the antidotes he had
prepared at hand, and so he died. Parathion is now said to be a favorite instrument of suicide in
Finland. In recent years the State of California has reported an average of more than 200 cases
of accidental parathion poisoning annually. In many parts of the world the fatality rate from
parathion is startling: 100 fatal cases in India and 67 in Syria in 1958, and an average of 336
deaths per year in Japan. Yet some 7,000,000 pounds of parathion are now applied to fields and
orchards of the United States—by hand sprayers, motorized blowers and dusters, and by
airplane. The amount used on California farms alone could, according to one medical authority,
‘provide a lethal dose for 5 to 10 times the whole world’s population.’
One of the few circumstances that save us from extinction by this means is the fact that
parathion and other chemicals of this group are decomposed rather rapidly. Their residues on
the crops to which they are applied are therefore relatively short-lived compared with the
chlorinated hydrocarbons. However, they last long enough to create hazards and produce
consequences that range from the merely serious to the fatal. In Riverside, California, eleven
out of thirty men picking oranges became violently ill and all but one had to be hospitalized.
Their symptoms were typical of parathion poisoning.

The grove had been sprayed with parathion some two and a half weeks earlier; the residues
that reduced them to retching, half-blind, semiconscious misery were sixteen to nineteen days
old. And this is not by any means a record for persistence. Similar mishaps have occurred in
groves sprayed a month earlier, and residues have been found in the peel of oranges six
months after treatment with standard dosages. The danger to all workers applying the organic
phosphorus insecticides in fields, orchards, and vineyards, is so extreme that some states using
these chemicals have established laboratories where physicians may obtain aid in diagnosis and
treatment. Even the physicians themselves may be in some danger, unless they wear rubber
gloves in handling the victims of poisoning. So may a laundress washing the clothing of such
victims, which may have absorbed enough parathion to affect her.
Malathion, another of the organic phosphates, is almost as familiar to the public as DDT, being
widely used by gardeners, in household insecticides, in mosquito spraying, and in such blanket
attacks on insects as the spraying of nearly a million acres of Florida communities for the
Mediterranean fruit fly. It is considered the least toxic of this group of chemicals and many
people assume they may use it freely and without fear of harm. Commercial advertising
encourages this comfortable attitude. The alleged ‘safety’ of malathion rests on rather
precarious ground, although—as often happens—this was not discovered until the chemical
had been in use for several years. Malathion is ‘safe’ only because the mammalian liver, an
organ with extraordinary protective powers, renders it relatively harmless. The detoxification is
accomplished by one of the enzymes of the liver. If, however, something destroys this enzyme
or interferes with its action, the person exposed to malathion receives the full force of the
poison.
Unfortunately for all of us, opportunities for this sort of thing to happen are legion. A few years
ago a team of Food and Drug Administration scientists discovered that when malathion and
certain other organic phosphates are administered simultaneously a massive poisoning
results—up to 50 times as severe as would be predicted on the basis of adding together the
toxicities of the two. In other words, of the lethal dose of each compound may be fatal when
the two are combined. This discovery led to the testing of other combinations. It is now known
that many pairs of organic phosphate insecticides are highly dangerous, the toxicity being
stepped up or ‘potentiated’ through the combined action. Potentiation seems to take place
when one compound destroys the liver enzyme responsible for detoxifying the other. The two
need not be given simultaneously. The hazard exists not only for the man who may spray this
week with one insecticide and next week with another; it exists also for the consumer of
sprayed products. The common salad bowl may easily present a combination of organic
phosphate insecticides. Residues well within the legally permissible limits may interact. The full
scope of the dangerous interaction of chemicals is as yet little known, but disturbing findings
now come regularly from scientific laboratories. Among these is the discovery that the toxicity
of an organic phosphate can be increased by a second agent that is not necessarily an
insecticide. For example, one of the plasticizing agents may act even more strongly than
another insecticide to make malathion more dangerous. Again, this is because it inhibits the
liver enzyme that normally would ‘draw the teeth’ of the poisonous insecticide.
What of other chemicals in the normal human environment? What, in particular, of drugs? A
bare beginning has been made on this subject, but already it is known that some organic
phosphates (parathion and malathion) increase the toxicity of some drugs used as muscle

relaxants, and that several others (again including malathion) markedly increase the sleeping
time of barbiturates. . . .
In Greek mythology the sorceress Medea, enraged at being supplanted by a rival for the
affections of her husband Jason, presented the new bride with a robe possessing magic
properties. The wearer of the robe immediately suffered a violent death. This death-byindirection now finds its counterpart in what are known as ‘systemic insecticides’. These are
chemicals with extraordinary properties which are used to convert plants or animals into a sort
of Medea’s robe by making them actually poisonous. This is done with the purpose of killing
insects that may come in contact with them, especially by sucking their juices or blood.
The world of systemic insecticides is a weird world, surpassing the imaginings of the brothers
Grimm—perhaps most closely akin to the cartoon world of Charles Addams. It is a world where
the enchanted forest of the fairy tales has become the poisonous forest in which an insect that
chews a leaf or sucks the sap of a plant is doomed. It is a world where a flea bites a dog, and
dies because the dog’s blood has been made poisonous, where an insect may die from vapors
emanating from a plant it has never touched, where a bee may carry poisonous nectar back to
its hive and presently produce poisonous honey.
The entomologists’ dream of the built-in insecticide was born when workers in the field of
applied entomology realized they could take a hint from nature: they found that wheat growing
in soil containing sodium selenate was immune to attack by aphids or spider mites. Selenium, a
naturally occurring element found sparingly in rocks and soils of many parts of the world, thus
became the first systemic insecticide. What makes an insecticide a systemic is the ability to
permeate all the tissues of a plant or animal and make them toxic. This quality is possessed by
some chemicals of the chlorinated hydrocarbon group and by others of the organophosphorus
group, all synthetically produced, as well as by certain naturally occurring substances. In
practice, however, most systemics are drawn from the organophosphorus group because the
problem of residues is somewhat less acute. Systemics act in other devious ways. Applied to
seeds, either by soaking or in a coating combined with carbon, they extend their effects into the
following plant generation and produce seedlings poisonous to aphids and other sucking
insects. Vegetables such as peas, beans, and sugar beets are sometimes thus protected. Cotton
seeds coated with a systemic insecticide have been in use for some time in California, where 25
farm labourers planting cotton in the San Joaquin Valley in 1959 were seized with sudden
illness, caused by handling the bags of treated seeds. In England someone wondered what
happened when bees made use of nectar from plants treated with systemics. This was
investigated in areas treated with a chemical called schradan. Although the plants had been
sprayed before the flowers were formed, the nectar later produced contained the poison. The
result, as might have been predicted, was that the honey made by the bees also was
contaminated with schradan.
Use of animal systemics has concentrated chiefly on control of the cattle grub, a damaging
parasite of livestock. Extreme care must be used in order to create an insecticidal effect in the
blood and tissues of the host without setting up a fatal poisoning. The balance is delicate and
government veterinarians have found that repeated small doses can gradually deplete an
animal’s supply of the protective enzyme cholinesterase, so that without warning a minute
additional dose will cause poisoning.

There are strong indications that fields closer to our daily lives are being opened up. You may
now give your dog a pill which, it is claimed, will rid him of fleas by making his blood poisonous
to them. The hazards discovered in treating cattle would presumably apply to the dog. As yet
no one seems to have proposed a human systemic that would make us lethal to a mosquito.
Perhaps this is the next step. . . .
So far in this chapter we have been discussing the deadly chemicals that are being used in our
war against the insects. What of our simultaneous war against the weeds? The desire for a
quick and easy method of killing unwanted plants has given rise to a large and growing array of
chemicals that are known as herbicides, or, less formally, as weed killers. The story of how
these chemicals are used and misused will be told in Chapter 6; the question that here concerns
us is whether the weed killers are poisons and whether their rise is contributing to the
poisoning of the environment.
The legend that the herbicides are toxic only to plants and so pose no threat to animal life has
been widely disseminated, but unfortunately it is not true. The plant killers include a large
variety of chemicals that act on animal tissue as well as on vegetation. They vary greatly in their
action on the organism. Some are general poisons, some are powerful stimulants of
metabolism, causing a fatal rise in body temperature, some induce malignant tumors either
alone or in partnership with other chemicals, some strike at the genetic material of the race by
causing gene mutations. The herbicides, then, like the insecticides, include some very
dangerous chemicals, and their careless use in the belief that they are ‘safe’ can have disastrous
results. Despite the competition of a constant stream of new chemicals issuing from the
laboratories, arsenic compounds are still liberally used, both as insecticides (as mentioned
above) and as weed killers, where they usually take the chemical form of sodium arsenite. The
history of their use is not reassuring. As roadside sprays, they have cost many a farmer his cow
and killed uncounted numbers of wild creatures. As aquatic weed killers in lakes and reservoirs
they have made public waters unsuitable for drinking or even for swimming. As a spray applied
to potato fields to destroy the vines they have taken a toll of human and nonhuman life.
In England this latter practice developed about 1951 as a result of a shortage of sulfuric acid,
formerly used to burn off the potato vines. The Ministry of Agriculture considered it necessary
to give warning of the hazard of going into the arsenic-sprayed fields, but the warning was not
understood by the cattle (nor, we must presume, by the wild animals and birds) and reports of
cattle poisoned by the arsenic sprays came with monotonous regularity. When death came also
to a farmer’s wife through arsenic-contaminated water, one of the major English chemical
companies (in 1959) stopped production of arsenical sprays and called in supplies already in the
hands of dealers, and shortly thereafter the Ministry of Agriculture announced that because of
high risks to people and cattle restrictions on the use of arsenites would be imposed. In 1961,
the Australian government announced a similar ban. No such restrictions impede the use of
these poisons in the United States, however.
Some of the ‘dinitro’ compounds are also used as herbicides. They are rated as among the most
dangerous materials of this type in use in the United States. Dinitrophenol is a strong metabolic
stimulant. For this reason it was at one time used as a reducing drug, but the margin between
the slimming dose and that required to poison or kill was slight—so slight that several patients
died and many suffered permanent injury before use of the drug was finally halted. A related
chemical, pentachlorophenol, sometimes known as ‘penta’, is used as a weed killer as well as

an insecticide, often being sprayed along railroad tracks and in waste areas. Penta is extremely
toxic to a wide variety of organisms from bacteria to man. Like the dinitros, it interferes, often
fatally, with the body’s source of energy, so that the affected organism almost literally burns
itself up. Its fearful power is illustrated in a fatal accident recently reported by the California
Department of Health. A tank truck driver was preparing a cotton defoliant by mixing diesel oil
with pentachlorophenol. As he was drawing the concentrated chemical out of a drum, the
spigot accidentally toppled back. He reached in with his bare hand to regain the spigot.
Although he washed immediately, he became acutely ill and died the next day.
While the results of weed killers such as sodium arsenite or the phenols are grossly obvious,
some other herbicides are more insidious in their effects. For example, the now famous
cranberry-weed killer aminotriazole, or amitrol, is rated as having relatively low toxicity. But in
the long run its tendency to cause malignant tumors of the thyroid may be far more significant
for wildlife and perhaps also for man. Among the herbicides are some that are classified as
‘mutagens’, or agents capable of modifying the genes, the materials of heredity. We are rightly
appalled by the genetic effects of radiation; how then, can we be indifferent to the same effect
in chemicals that we disseminate widely in our environment?

4. Surface Waters and Underground Seas
OF ALL our natural resources water has become the most precious. By far the greater
part of the earth’s surface is covered by its enveloping seas, yet in the midst of this plenty we
are in want. By a strange paradox, most of the earth’s abundant water is not usable for
agriculture, industry, or human consumption because of its heavy load of sea salts, and so most
of the world’s population is either experiencing or is threatened with critical shortages. In an
age when man has forgotten his origins and is blind even to his most essential needs for
survival, water along with other resources has become the victim of his indifference.
The problem of water pollution by pesticides can be understood only in context, as part of the
whole to which it belongs—the pollution of the total environment of mankind. The pollution
entering our waterways comes from many sources: radioactive wastes from reactors,
laboratories, and hospitals; fallout from nuclear explosions; domestic wastes from cities and
towns; chemical wastes from factories. To these is added a new kind of fallout—the chemical
sprays applied to croplands and gardens, forests and fields. Many of the chemical agents in this
alarming mélange imitate and augment the harmful effects of radiation, and within the groups
of chemicals themselves there are sinister and little understood interactions, transformations,
and summations of effect.
Ever since chemists began to manufacture substances that nature never invented, the problems
of water purification have become complex and the danger to users of water has increased. As
we have seen, the production of these synthetic chemicals in large volume began in the 1940s.
It has now reached such proportions that an appalling deluge of chemical pollution is daily
poured into the nation’s waterways. When inextricably mixed with domestic and other wastes
discharged into the same water, these chemicals sometimes defy detection by the methods in
ordinary use by purification plants. Most of them are so stable that they cannot be broken
down by ordinary processes. Often they cannot even be identified. In rivers, a really incredible
variety of pollutants combine to produce deposits that the sanitary engineers can only
despairingly refer to as ‘gunk’. Professor Rolf Eliassen of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology testified before a congressional committee to the impossibility of predicting the
composite effect of these chemicals, or of identifying the organic matter resulting from the
mixture. ‘We don’t begin to know what that is,’ said Professor Eliassen. ‘What is the effect on
the people? We don’t know.’
To an ever-increasing degree, chemicals used for the control of insects, rodents, or unwanted
vegetation contribute to these organic pollutants. Some are deliberately applied to bodies of
water to destroy plants, insect larvae, or undesired fishes. Some come from forest spraying that
may blanket two or three million acres of a single state with spray directed against a single
insect pest—spray that falls directly into streams or that drips down through the leafy canopy
to the forest floor, there to become part of the slow movement of seeping moisture beginning
its long journey to the sea. Probably the bulk of such contaminants are the waterborne residues
of the millions of pounds of agricultural chemicals that have been applied to farmlands for
insect or rodent control and have been leached out of the ground by rains to become part of
the universal seaward movement of water.

Here and there we have dramatic evidence of the presence of these chemicals in our streams
and even in public water supplies. For example, a sample of drinking water from an orchard
area in Pennsylvania, when tested on fish in a laboratory, contained enough insecticide to kill all
of the test fish in only four hours. Water from a stream draining sprayed cotton fields remained
lethal to fishes even after it had passed through a purifying plant, and in fifteen streams
tributary to the Tennessee River in Alabama the runoff from fields treated with toxaphene, a
chlorinated hydrocarbon, killed all the fish inhabiting the streams. Two of these streams were
sources of municipal water supply. Yet for a week after the application of the insecticide the
water remained poisonous, a fact attested by the daily deaths of goldfish suspended in cages
downstream.
For the most part this pollution is unseen and invisible, making its presence known when
hundreds or thousands of fish die, but more often never detected at all. The chemist who
guards water purity has no routine tests for these organic pollutants and no way to remove
them. But whether detected or not, the pesticides are there, and as might be expected with any
materials applied to land surfaces on so vast a scale, they have now found their way into many
and perhaps all of the major river systems of the country.
If anyone doubts that our waters have become almost universally contaminated with
insecticides he should study a small report issued by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service
in 1960. The Service had carried out studies to discover whether fish, like warm-blooded
animals, store insecticides in their tissues. The first samples were taken from forest areas in the
West where there had been mass spraying of DDT for the control of the spruce budworm. As
might have been expected, all of these fish contained DDT. The really significant findings were
made when the investigators turned for comparison to a creek in a remote area about 30 miles
from the nearest spraying for budworm control. This creek was upstream from the first and
separated from it by a high waterfall. No local spraying was known to have occurred. Yet these
fish, too, contained DDT. Had the chemical reached this remote creek by hidden underground
streams? Or had it been airborne, drifting down as fallout on the surface of the creek? In still
another comparative study, DDT was found in the tissues of fish from a hatchery where the
water supply originated in a deep well. Again there was no record of local spraying. The only
possible means of contamination seemed to be by means of groundwater.
In the entire water-pollution problem, there is probably nothing more disturbing than the
threat of widespread contamination of groundwater. It is not possible to add pesticides to
water anywhere without threatening the purity of water everywhere. Seldom if ever does
Nature operate in closed and separate compartments, and she has not done so in distributing
the earth’s water supply. Rain, falling on the land, settles down through pores and cracks in soil
and rock, penetrating deeper and deeper until eventually it reaches a zone where all the pores
of the rock are filled with water, a dark, subsurface sea, rising under hills, sinking beneath
valleys. This groundwater is always on the move, sometimes at a pace so slow that it travels no
more than 50 feet a year, sometimes rapidly, by comparison, so that it moves nearly a tenth of
a mile in a day. It travels by unseen waterways until here and there it comes to the surface as a
spring, or perhaps it is tapped to feed a well. But mostly it contributes to streams and so to
rivers. Except for what enters streams directly as rain or surface runoff, all the running water of
the earth’s surface was at one time groundwater. And so, in a very real and frightening sense,
pollution of the groundwater is pollution of water everywhere. . . .

It must have been by such a dark, underground sea that poisonous chemicals traveled from a
manufacturing plant in Colorado to a farming district several miles away, there to poison wells,
sicken humans and livestock, and damage crops—an extraordinary episode that may easily be
only the first of many like it. Its history, in brief, is this. In 1943, the Rocky Mountain Arsenal of
the Army Chemical Corps, located near Denver, began to manufacture war materials. Eight
years later the facilities of the arsenal were leased to a private oil company for the production
of insecticides. Even before the change of operations, however, mysterious reports had begun
to come in. Farmers several miles from the plant began to report unexplained sickness among
livestock; they complained of extensive crop damage. Foliage turned yellow, plants failed to
mature, and many crops were killed outright. There were reports of human illness, thought by
some to be related.
The irrigation waters on these farms were derived from shallow wells. When the well waters
were examined (in a study in 1959, in which several state and federal agencies participated)
they were found to contain an assortment of chemicals. Chlorides, chlorates, salts of
phosphoric acid, fluorides, and arsenic had been discharged from the Rocky Mountain Arsenal
into holding ponds during the years of its operation. Apparently the groundwater between the
arsenal and the farms had become contaminated and it had taken 7 to 8 years for the wastes to
travel underground a distance of about 3 miles from the holding ponds to the nearest farm.
This seepage had continued to spread and had further contaminated an area of unknown
extent. The investigators knew of no way to contain the contamination or halt its advance.
All this was bad enough, but the most mysterious and probably in the long run the most
significant feature of the whole episode was the discovery of the weed killer 2,4-D in some of
the wells and in the holding ponds of the arsenal. Certainly its presence was enough to account
for the damage to crops irrigated with this water. But the mystery lay in the fact that no 2,4-D
had been manufactured at the arsenal at any stage of its operations. After long and careful
study, the chemists at the plant concluded that the 2,4-D had been formed spontaneously in
the open basins. It had been formed there from other substances discharged from the arsenal;
in the presence of air, water, and sunlight, and quite without the intervention of human
chemists, the holding ponds had become chemical laboratories for the production of a new
chemical—a chemical fatally damaging to much of the plant life it touched. And so the story of
the Colorado farms and their damaged crops assumes a significance that transcends its local
importance. What other parallels may there be, not only in Colorado but wherever chemical
pollution finds its way into public waters? In lakes and streams everywhere, in the presence of
catalyzing air and sunlight, what dangerous substances may be born of parent chemicals
labeled ‘harmless’?
Indeed one of the most alarming aspects of the chemical pollution of water is the fact that
here—in river or lake or reservoir, or for that matter in the glass of water served at your dinner
table—are mingled chemicals that no responsible chemist would think of combining in his
laboratory. The possible interactions between these freely mixed chemicals are deeply
disturbing to officials of the United States Public Health Service, who have expressed the fear
that the production of harmful substances from comparatively innocuous chemicals may be
taking place on quite a wide scale. The reactions may be between two or more chemicals, or
between chemicals and the radioactive wastes that are being discharged into our rivers in everincreasing volume. Under the impact of ionizing radiation some rearrangement of atoms could

easily occur, changing the nature of the chemicals in a way that is not only unpredictable but
beyond control. It is, of course, not only the groundwaters that are becoming contaminated,
but surface-moving waters as well— streams, rivers, irrigation waters. A disturbing example of
the latter seems to be building up on the national wildlife refuges at Tule Lake and Lower
Klamath, both in California. These refuges are part of a chain including also the refuge on Upper
Klamath Lake just over the border in Oregon. All are linked, perhaps fatefully, by a shared water
supply, and all are affected by the fact that they lie like small islands in a great sea of
surrounding farmlands—land reclaimed by drainage and stream diversion from an original
waterfowl paradise of marshland and open water.
These farmlands around the refuges are now irrigated by water from Upper Klamath Lake. The
irrigation waters, recollected from the fields they have served, are then pumped into Tule Lake
and from there to Lower Klamath. All of the waters of the wildlife refuges established on these
two bodies of water therefore represent the drainage of agricultural lands. It is important to
remember this in connection with recent happenings. In the summer of 1960 the refuge staff
picked up hundreds of dead and dying birds at Tule Lake and Lower Klamath. Most of them
were fish-eating species—herons, pelicans, gulls. Upon analysis, they were found to contain
insecticide residues identified as toxaphene, DDD, and DDE. Fish from the lakes were also found
to contain insecticides; so did samples of plankton. The refuge manager believes that pesticide
residues are now building up in the waters of these refuges, being conveyed there by return
irrigation flow from heavily sprayed agricultural lands.
Such poisoning of waters set aside for conservation purposes could have consequences felt by
every western duck hunter and by everyone to whom the sight and sound of drifting ribbons of
waterfowl across an evening sky are precious. These particular refuges occupy critical positions
in the conservation of western waterfowl. They lie at a point corresponding to the narrow neck
of a funnel, into which all the migratory paths composing what is known as the Pacific Flyway
converge. During the fall migration they receive many millions of ducks and geese from nesting
grounds extending from the shores of Bering Sea east to Hudson Bay—fully three fourths of all
the waterfowl that move south into the Pacific Coast states in autumn. In summer they provide
nesting areas for waterfowl, especially for two endangered species, the redhead and the ruddy
duck. If the lakes and pools of these refuges become seriously contaminated the damage to the
waterfowl populations of the Far West could be irreparable. Water must also be thought of in
terms of the chains of life it supports—from the small-as-dust green cells of the drifting plant
plankton, through the minute water fleas to the fishes that strain plankton from the water and
are in turn eaten by other fishes or by birds, mink, raccoons—in an endless cyclic transfer of
materials from life to life. We know that the necessary minerals in the water are so passed from
link to link of the food chains. Can we suppose that poisons we introduce into water will not
also enter into these cycles of nature?
The answer is to be found in the amazing history of Clear Lake, California. Clear Lake lies in
mountainous country some 90 miles north of San Francisco and has long been popular with
anglers. The name is inappropriate, for actually it is a rather turbid lake because of the soft
black ooze that covers its shallow bottom. Unfortunately for the fishermen and the resort
dwellers on its shores, its waters have provided an ideal habitat for a small gnat, Chaoborus
astictopus. Although closely related to mosquitoes, the gnat is not a bloodsucker and probably
does not feed at all as an adult. However, human beings who shared its habitat found it

annoying because of its sheer numbers. Efforts were made to control it but they were largely
fruitless until, in the late 1940s, the chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticides offered new weapons.
The chemical chosen for a fresh attack was DDD, a close relative of DDT but apparently offering
fewer threats to fish life. The new control measures undertaken in 1949 were carefully planned
and few people would have supposed any harm could result. The lake was surveyed, its volume
determined, and the insecticide applied in such great dilution that for every part of chemical
there would be 70 million parts of water. Control of the gnats was at first good, but by 1954 the
treatment had to be repeated, this time at the rate of 1 part of insecticide in 50 million parts of
water. The destruction of the gnats was thought to be virtually complete.
The following winter months brought the first intimation that other life was affected: the
western grebes on the lake began to die, and soon more than a hundred of them were reported
dead. At Clear Lake the western grebe is a breeding bird and also a winter visitant, attracted by
the abundant fish of the lake. It is a bird of spectacular appearance and beguiling habits,
building its floating nests in shallow lakes of western United States and Canada. It is called the
‘swan grebe’ with reason, for it glides with scarcely a ripple across the lake surface, the body
riding low, white neck and shining black head held high. The newly hatched chick is clothed in
soft gray down; in only a few hours it takes to the water and rides on the back of the father or
mother, nestled under the parental wing coverts.
Following a third assault on the ever-resilient gnat population, in 1957, more grebes died. As
had been true in 1954, no evidence of infectious disease could be discovered on examination of
the dead birds. But when someone thought to analyze the fatty tissues of the grebes, they were
found to be loaded with DDD in the extraordinary concentration of 1600 parts per million. The
maximum concentration applied to the water was part per million. How could the chemical
have built up to such prodigious levels in the grebes? These birds, of course, are fish eaters.
When the fish of Clear Lake also were analyzed the picture began to take form—the poison
being picked up by the smallest organisms, concentrated and passed on to the larger predators.
Plankton organisms were found to contain about 5 parts per million of the insecticide (about 25
times the maximum concentration ever reached in the water itself); plant-eating fishes had
built up accumulations ranging from 40 to 300 parts per million; carnivorous species had stored
the most of all. One, a brown bullhead, had the astounding concentration of 2500 parts per
million. It was a house-that-Jack-built sequence, in which the large carnivores had eaten the
smaller carnivores, that had eaten the herbivores, that had eaten the plankton, that had
absorbed the poison from the water.
Even more extraordinary discoveries were made later. No trace of DDD could be found in the
water shortly after the last application of the chemical. But the poison had not really left the
lake; it had merely gone into the fabric of the life the lake supports. Twenty-three months after
the chemical treatment had ceased, the plankton still contained as much as 5.3 parts per
million. In that interval of nearly two years, successive crops of plankton had flowered and
faded away, but the poison, although no longer present in the water, had somehow passed
from generation to generation. And it lived on in the animal life of the lake as well. All fish,
birds, and frogs examined a year after the chemical applications had ceased still contained
DDD. The amount found in the flesh always exceeded by many times the original concentration
in the water. Among these living carriers were fish that had hatched nine months after the last
DDD application, grebes, and California gulls that had built up concentrations of more than

2000 parts per million. Meanwhile, the nesting colonies of the grebes dwindled—from more
than 1000 pairs before the first insecticide treatment to about 30 pairs in 1960. And even the
thirty seem to have nested in vain, for no young grebes have been observed on the lake since
the last DDD application.
This whole chain of poisoning, then, seems to rest on a base of minute plants which must have
been the original concentrators. But what of the opposite end of the food chain—the human
being who, in probable ignorance of all this sequence of events, has rigged his fishing tackle,
caught a string of fish from the waters of Clear Lake, and taken them home to fry for his
supper? What could a heavy dose of DDD, or perhaps repeated doses, do to him? Although the
California Department of Public Health professed to see no hazard, nevertheless in 1959 it
required that the use of DDD in the lake be stopped. In view of the scientific evidence of the
vast biological potency of this chemical, the action seems a minimum safety measure. The
physiological effect of DDD is probably unique among insecticides, for it destroys part of the
adrenal gland— the cells of the outer layer known as the adrenal cortex, which secretes the
hormone cortin. This destructive effect, known since 1948, was at first believed to be confined
to dogs, because it was not revealed in such experimental animals as monkeys, rats, or rabbits.
It seemed suggestive, however, that DDD produced in dogs a condition very similar to that
occurring in man in the presence of Addison’s disease. Recent medical research has revealed
that DDD does strongly suppress the function of the human adrenal cortex. Its cell-destroying
capacity is now clinically utilized in the treatment of a rare type of cancer which develops in the
adrenal gland. . . .
The Clear Lake situation brings up a question that the public needs to face: Is it wise or
desirable to use substances with such strong effect on physiological processes for the control of
insects, especially when the control measures involve introducing the chemical directly into a
body of water? The fact that the insecticide was applied in very low concentrations is
meaningless, as its explosive progress through the natural food chain in the lake demonstrates.
Yet Clear Lake is typical of a large and growing number of situations where solution of an
obvious and often trivial problem creates a far more serious but conveniently less tangible one.
Here the problem was resolved in favor of those annoyed by gnats, and at the expense of an
unstated, and probably not even clearly understood, risk to all who took food or water from the
lake. It is an extraordinary fact that the deliberate introduction of poisons into a reservoir is
becoming a fairly common practice. The purpose is usually to promote recreational uses, even
though the water must then be treated at some expense to make it fit for its intended use as
drinking water. When sportsmen of an area want to ‘improve’ fishing in a reservoir, they prevail
on authorities to dump quantities of poison into it to kill the undesired fish, which are then
replaced with hatchery fish more suited to the sportsmen’s taste. The procedure has a strange,
Alice-in-Wonderland quality. The reservoir was created as a public water supply, yet the
community, probably unconsulted about the sportsmen’s project, is forced either to drink
water containing poisonous residues or to pay out tax money for treatment of the water to
remove the poisons—treatments that are by no means foolproof.
As ground and surface waters are contaminated with pesticides and other chemicals, there is
danger that not only poisonous but also cancer-producing substances are being introduced into
public water supplies. Dr. W. C. Hueper of the National Cancer Institute has warned that ‘the
danger of cancer hazards from the consumption of contaminated drinking water will grow

considerably within the foreseeable future.’ And indeed a study made in Holland in the early
1950s provides support for the view that polluted waterways may carry a cancer hazard. Cities
receiving their drinking water from rivers had a higher death rate from cancer than did those
whose water came from sources presumably less susceptible to pollution such as wells. Arsenic,
the environmental substance most clearly established as causing cancer in man, is involved in
two historic cases in which polluted water supplies caused widespread occurrence of cancer. In
one case the arsenic came from the slag heaps of mining operations, in the other from rock
with a high natural content of arsenic. These conditions may easily be duplicated as a result of
heavy applications of arsenical insecticides. The soil in such areas becomes poisoned. Rains
then carry part of the arsenic into streams, rivers, and reservoirs, as well as into the vast
subterranean seas of groundwater.
Here again we are reminded that in nature nothing exists alone. To understand more clearly
how the pollution of our world is happening, we must now look at another of the earth’s basic
resources, the soil.

5. Realms of the Soil
THE THIN LAYER of soil that forms a patchy covering over the continents controls our
own existence and that of every other animal of the land. Without soil, land plants as we know
them could not grow, and without plants no animals could survive.
Yet if our agriculture-based life depends on the soil, it is equally true that soil depends on life,
its very origins and the maintenance of its true nature being intimately related to living plants
and animals. For soil is in part a creation of life, born of a marvelous interaction of life and
nonlife long eons ago. The parent materials were gathered together as volcanoes poured them
out in fiery streams, as waters running over the bare rocks of the continents wore away even
the hardest granite, and as the chisels of frost and ice split and shattered the rocks. Then living
things began to work their creative magic and little by little these inert materials became soil.
Lichens, the rocks’ first covering, aided the process of disintegration by their acid secretions and
made a lodging place for other life. Mosses took hold in the little pockets of simple soil—soil
formed by crumbling bits of lichen, by the husks of minute insect life, by the debris of a fauna
beginning its emergence from the sea.
Life not only formed the soil, but other living things of incredible abundance and diversity now
exist within it; if this were not so the soil would be a dead and sterile thing. By their presence
and by their activities the myriad organisms of the soil make it capable of supporting the earth’s
green mantle. The soil exists in a state of constant change, taking part in cycles that have no
beginning and no end. New materials are constantly being contributed as rocks disintegrate, as
organic matter decays, and as nitrogen and other gases are brought down in rain from the
skies. At the same time other materials are being taken away, borrowed for temporary use by
living creatures. Subtle and vastly important chemical changes are constantly in progress,
converting elements derived from air and water into forms suitable for use by plants. In all
these changes living organisms are active agents.
There are few studies more fascinating, and at the same time more neglected, than those of
the teeming populations that exist in the dark realms of the soil. We know too little of the
threads that bind the soil organisms to each other and to their world, and to the world above.
Perhaps the most essential organisms in the soil are the smallest—the invisible hosts of
bacteria and of threadlike fungi. Statistics of their abundance take us at once into astronomical
figures. A teaspoonful of topsoil may contain billions of bacteria. In spite of their minute size,
the total weight of this host of bacteria in the top foot of a single acre of fertile soil may be as
much as a thousand pounds. Ray fungi, growing in long threadlike filaments, are somewhat less
numerous than the bacteria, yet because they are larger their total weight in a given amount of
soil may be about the same. With small green cells called algae, these make up the microscopic
plant life of the soil. Bacteria, fungi, and algae are the principal agents of decay, reducing plant
and animal residues to their component minerals. The vast cyclic movements of chemical
elements such as carbon and nitrogen through soil and air and living tissue could not proceed
without these microplants. Without the nitrogen-fixing bacteria, for example, plants would
starve for want of nitrogen, though surrounded by a sea of nitrogen-containing air. Other
organisms form carbon dioxide, which, as carbonic acid, aids in dissolving rock. Still other soil

microbes perform various oxidations and reductions by which minerals such as iron,
manganese, and sulfur are transformed and made available to plants.
Also present in prodigious numbers are microscopic mites and primitive wingless insects called
springtails. Despite their small size they play an important part in breaking down the residues of
plants, aiding in the slow conversion of the litter of the forest floor to soil. The specialization of
some of these minute creatures for their task is almost incredible. Several species of mites, for
example, can begin life only within the fallen needles of a spruce tree. Sheltered here, they
digest out the inner tissues of the needle. When the mites have completed their development
only the outer layer of cells remains. The truly staggering task of dealing with the tremendous
amount of plant material in the annual leaf fall belongs to some of the small insects of the soil
and the forest floor. They macerate and digest the leaves, and aid in mixing the decomposed
matter with the surface soil.
Besides all this horde of minute but ceaselessly toiling creatures there are of course many
larger forms, for soil life runs the gamut from bacteria to mammals. Some are permanent
residents of the dark subsurface layers; some hibernate or spend definite parts of their life
cycles in underground chambers; some freely come and go between their burrows and the
upper world. In general the effect of all this habitation of the soil is to aerate it and improve
both its drainage and the penetration of water throughout the layers of plant growth.
Of all the larger inhabitants of the soil, probably none is more important than the earthworm.
Over three quarters of a century ago, Charles Darwin published a book titled The Formation of
Vegetable Mould, through the Action of Worms, with Observations on Their Habits. In it he gave
the world its first understanding of the fundamental role of earthworms as geologic agents for
the transport of soil—a picture of surface rocks being gradually covered by fine soil brought up
from below by the worms, in annual amounts running to many tons to the acre in most
favorable areas. At the same time, quantities of organic matter contained in leaves and grass
(as much as 20 pounds to the square yard in six months) are drawn down into the burrows and
incorporated in soil. Darwin’s calculations showed that the toil of earthworms might add a layer
of soil an inch to an inch and a half thick in a ten-year period. And this is by no means all they
do: their burrows aerate the soil, keep it well drained, and aid the penetration of plant roots.
The presence of earthworms increases the nitrifying powers of the soil bacteria and decreases
putrefaction of the soil. Organic matter is broken down as it passes through the digestive tracts
of the worms and the soil is enriched by their excretory products. This soil community, then,
consists of a web of interwoven lives, each in some way related to the others—the living
creatures depending on the soil, but the soil in turn a vital element of the earth only so long as
this community within it flourishes.
The problem that concerns us here is one that has received little consideration: What happens
to these incredibly numerous and vitally necessary inhabitants of the soil when poisonous
chemicals are carried down into their world, either introduced directly as soil ‘sterilants’ or
borne on the rain that has picked up a lethal contamination as it filters through the leaf canopy
of forest and orchard and cropland? Is it reasonable to suppose that we can apply a broadspectrum insecticide to kill the burrowing larval stages of a crop-destroying insect, for example,
without also killing the ‘good’ insects whose function may be the essential one of breaking
down organic matter? Or can we use a nonspecific fungicide without also killing the fungi that

inhabit the roots of many trees in a beneficial association that aids the tree in extracting
nutrients from the soil?
The plain truth is that this critically important subject of the ecology of the soil has been largely
neglected even by scientists and almost completely ignored by control men. Chemical control
of insects seems to have proceeded on the assumption that the soil could and would sustain
any amount of insult via the introduction of poisons without striking back. The very nature of
the world of the soil has been largely ignored. From the few studies that have been made, a
picture of the impact of pesticides on the soil is slowly emerging. It is not surprising that the
studies are not always in agreement, for soil types vary so enormously that what causes
damage in one may be innocuous in another. Light sandy soils suffer far more heavily than
humus types. Combinations of chemicals seem to do more harm than separate applications.
Despite the varying results, enough solid evidence of harm is accumulating to cause
apprehension on the part of many scientists. Under some conditions, the chemical conversions
and transformations that lie at the very heart of the living world are affected. Nitrification,
which makes atmospheric nitrogen available to plants, is an example. The herbicide 2,4-D
causes a temporary interruption of nitrification. In recent experiments in Florida, lindane,
heptachlor, and BHC (benzene hexachloride) reduced nitrification after only two weeks in soil;
BHC and DDT had significantly detrimental effects a year after treatment. In other experiments
BHC, aldrin, lindane, heptachlor, and DDD all prevented nitrogen-fixing bacteria from forming
the necessary root nodules on leguminous plants. A curious but beneficial relation between
fungi and the roots of higher plants is seriously disrupted. Sometimes the problem is one of
upsetting that delicate balance of populations by which nature accomplishes far-reaching aims.
Explosive increases in some kinds of soil organisms have occurred when others have been
reduced by insecticides, disturbing the relation of predator to prey. Such changes could easily
alter the metabolic activity of the soil and affect its productivity. They could also mean that
potentially harmful organisms, formerly held in check, could escape from their natural controls
and rise to pest status.
One of the most important things to remember about insecticides in soil is their long
persistence, measured not in months but in years. Aldrin has been recovered after four years,
both as traces and more abundantly as converted to dieldrin. Enough toxaphene remains in
sandy soil ten years after its application to kill termites. Benzene hexachloride persists at least
eleven years; heptachlor or a more toxic derived chemical, at least nine. Chlordane has been
recovered twelve years after its application, in the amount of 15 per cent of the original
quantity.
Seemingly moderate applications of insecticides over a period of years may build up fantastic
quantities in soil. Since the chlorinated hydrocarbons are persistent and long-lasting, each
application is merely added to the quantity remaining from the previous one. The old legend
that ‘a pound of DDT to the acre is harmless’ means nothing if spraying is repeated. Potato soils
have been found to contain up to 15 pounds of DDT per acre, corn soils up to 19. A cranberry
bog under study contained 34.5 pounds to the acre. Soils from apple orchards seem to reach
the peak of contamination, with DDT accumulating at a rate that almost keeps pace with its
rate of annual application. Even in a single season, with orchards sprayed four or more times,
DDT residues may build up to peaks of 30 to 50 pounds. With repeated spraying over the years
the range between trees is from 26 to 60 pounds to the acre; under trees, up to 113 pounds.

Arsenic provides a classic case of the virtually permanent poisoning of the soil. Although arsenic
as a spray on growing tobacco has been largely replaced by the synthetic organic insecticides
since the mid-40s, the arsenic content of cigarettes made from American-grown tobacco
increased more than 300 per cent between the years 1932 and 1952. Later studies have
revealed increases of as much as 600 per cent. Dr. Henry S. Satterlee, an authority on arsenic
toxicology, says that although organic insecticides have been largely substituted for arsenic, the
tobacco plants continue to pick up the old poison, for the soils of tobacco plantations are now
thoroughly impregnated with residues of a heavy and relatively insoluble poison, arsenate of
lead. This will continue to release arsenic in soluble form. The soil of a large proportion of the
land planted to tobacco has been subjected to ‘cumulative and well-nigh permanent poisoning’,
according to Dr. Satterlee. Tobacco grown in the eastern Mediterranean countries where
arsenical insecticides are not used has shown no such increase in arsenic content.
We are therefore confronted with a second problem. We must not only be concerned with
what is happening to the soil; we must wonder to what extent insecticides are absorbed from
contaminated soils and introduced into plant tissues. Much depends on the type of soil, the
crop, and the nature and concentration of the insecticide. Soil high in organic matter releases
smaller quantities of poisons than others. Carrots absorb more insecticide than any other crop
studied; if the chemical used happens to be lindane, carrots actually accumulate higher
concentrations than are present in the soil. In the future it may become necessary to analyze
soils for insecticides before planting certain food crops. Otherwise even unsprayed crops may
take up enough insecticide merely from the soil to render them unfit for market. This very sort
of contamination has created endless problems for at least one leading manufacturer of baby
foods who has been unwilling to buy any fruits or vegetables on which toxic insecticides have
been used. The chemical that caused him the most trouble was benzene hexachloride (BHC),
which is taken up by the roots and tubers of plants, advertising its presence by a musty taste
and odor. Sweet potatoes grown on California fields where BHC had been used two years
earlier contained residues and had to be rejected. In one year, in which the firm had contracted
in South Carolina for its total requirements of sweet potatoes, so large a proportion of the
acreage was found to be contaminated that the company was forced to buy in the open market
at a considerable financial loss. Over the years a variety of fruits and vegetables, grown in
various states, have had to be rejected. The most stubborn problems were concerned with
peanuts. In the southern states peanuts are usually grown in rotation with cotton, on which
BHC is extensively used. Peanuts grown later in this soil pick up considerable amounts of the
insecticide. Actually, only a trace is enough to incorporate the telltale musty odor and taste.
The chemical penetrates the nuts and cannot be removed. Processing, far from removing the
mustiness, sometimes accentuates it. The only course open to a manufacturer determined to
exclude BHC residues is to reject all produce treated with the chemical or grown on soils
contaminated with it. Sometimes the menace is to the crop itself—a menace that remains as
long as the insecticide contamination is in the soil. Some insecticides affect sensitive plants such
as beans, wheat, barley, or rye, retarding root development or depressing growth of seedlings.
The experience of the hop growers in Washington and Idaho is an example. During the spring of
1955 many of these growers undertook a large-scale program to control the strawberry root
weevil, whose larvae had become abundant on the roots of the hops. On the advice of
agricultural experts and insecticide manufacturers, they chose heptachlor as the control agent.

Within a year after the heptachlor was applied, the vines in the treated yards were wilting and
dying. In the untreated fields there was no trouble; the damage stopped at the border between
treated and untreated fields. The hills were replanted at great expense, but in another year the
new roots, too, were found to be dead. Four years later the soil still contained heptachlor, and
scientists were unable to predict how long it would remain poisonous, or to recommend any
procedure for correcting the condition. The federal Department of Agriculture, which as late as
March 1959 found itself in the anomalous position of declaring heptachlor to be acceptable for
use on hops in the form of a soil treatment, belatedly withdrew its registration for such use.
Meanwhile, the hop growers sought what redress they could in the courts.
As applications of pesticides continue and the virtually indestructible residues continue to build
up in the soil, it is almost certain that we are heading for trouble. This was the consensus of a
group of specialists who met at Syracuse University in 1960 to discuss the ecology of the soil.
These men summed up the hazards of using ‘such potent and little understood tools’ as
chemicals and radiation: ‘A few false moves on the part of man may result in destruction of soil
productivity and the arthropods may well take over.’

6. Earth’s Green Mantle
WATER, SOIL, and the earth’s green mantle of plants make up the world that supports
the animal life of the earth.
Although modern man seldom remembers the fact, he could not exist without the plants that
harness the sun’s energy and manufacture the basic foodstuffs he depends upon for life. Our
attitude toward plants is a singularly narrow one. If we see any immediate utility in a plant we
foster it. If for any reason we find its presence undesirable or merely a matter of indifference,
we may condemn it to destruction forthwith. Besides the various plants that are poisonous to
man or his livestock, or crowd out food plants, many are marked for destruction merely
because, according to our narrow view, they happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong
time. Many others are destroyed merely because they happen to be associates of the
unwanted plants.
The earth’s vegetation is part of a web of life in which there are intimate and essential relations
between plants and the earth, between plants and other plants, between plants and animals.
Sometimes we have no choice but to disturb these relationships, but we should do so
thoughtfully, with full awareness that what we do may have consequences remote in time and
place. But no such humility marks the booming ‘weed killer’ business of the present day, in
which soaring sales and expanding uses mark the production of plant-killing chemicals. One of
the most tragic examples of our unthinking bludgeoning of the landscape is to be seen in the
sagebrush lands of the West, where a vast campaign is on to destroy the sage and to substitute
grasslands. If ever an enterprise needed to be illuminated with a sense of the history and
meaning of the landscape, it is this. For here the natural landscape is eloquent of the interplay
of forces that have created it. It is spread before us like the pages of an open book in which we
can read why the land is what it is, and why we should preserve its integrity. But the pages lie
unread.
The land of the sage is the land of the high western plains and the lower slopes of the
mountains that rise above them, a land born of the great uplift of the Rocky Mountain system
many millions of years ago. It is a place of harsh extremes of climate: of long winters when
blizzards drive down from the mountains and snow lies deep on the plains, of summers whose
heat is relieved by only scanty rains, with drought biting deep into the soil, and drying winds
stealing moisture from leaf and stem. As the landscape evolved, there must have been a long
period of trial and error in which plants attempted the colonization of this high and windswept
land. One after another must have failed. At last one group of plants evolved which combined
all the qualities needed to survive. The sage—low-growing and shrubby—could hold its place
on the mountain slopes and on the plains, and within its small gray leaves it could hold
moisture enough to defy the thieving winds. It was no accident, but rather the result of long
ages of experimentation by nature, that the great plains of the West became the land of the
sage.
Along with the plants, animal life, too, was evolving in harmony with the searching
requirements of the land. In time there were two as perfectly adjusted to their habitat as the
sage. One was a mammal, the fleet and graceful pronghorn antelope. The other was a bird, the
sage grouse—the ‘cock of the plains’ of Lewis and Clark. The sage and the grouse seem made

for each other. The original range of the bird coincided with the range of the sage, and as the
sagelands have been reduced, so the populations of grouse have dwindled. The sage is all
things to these birds of the plains. The low sage of the foothill ranges shelters their nests and
their young; the denser growths are loafing and roosting areas; at all times the sage provides
the staple food of the grouse. Yet it is a two-way relationship. The spectacular courtship
displays of the cocks help loosen the soil beneath and around the sage, aiding invasion by
grasses which grow in the shelter of sagebrush. The antelope, too, have adjusted their lives to
the sage. They are primarily animals of the plains, and in winter when the first snows come
those that have summered in the mountains move down to the lower elevations. There the
sage provides the food that tides them over the winter. Where all other plants have shed their
leaves, the sage remains evergreen, the gray-green leaves—bitter, aromatic, rich in proteins,
fats, and needed minerals—clinging to the stems of the dense and shrubby plants. Though the
snows pile up, the tops of the sage remain exposed, or can be reached by the sharp, pawing
hoofs of the antelope. Then grouse feed on them too, finding them on bare and windswept
ledges or following the antelope to feed where they have scratched away the snow.
And other life looks to the sage. Mule deer often feed on it. Sage may mean survival for wintergrazing livestock. Sheep graze many winter ranges where the big sagebrush forms almost pure
stands. For half the year it is their principal forage, a plant of higher energy value than even
alfalfa hay. The bitter upland plains, the purple wastes of sage, the wild, swift antelope, and the
grouse are then a natural system in perfect balance. Are? The verb must be changed—at least
in those already vast and growing areas where man is attempting to improve on nature’s way.
In the name of progress the land management agencies have set about to satisfy the insatiable
demands of the cattlemen for more grazing land. By this they mean grassland—grass without
sage. So in a land which nature found suited to grass growing mixed with and under the shelter
of sage, it is now proposed to eliminate the sage and create unbroken grassland. Few seem to
have asked whether grasslands are a stable and desirable goal in this region. Certainly nature’s
own answer was otherwise. The annual precipitation in this land where the rains seldom fall is
not enough to support good sod-forming grass; it favors rather the perennial bunchgrass that
grows in the shelter of the sage.
Yet the program of sage eradication has been under way for a number of years. Several
government agencies are active in it; industry has joined with enthusiasm to promote and
encourage an enterprise which creates expanded markets not only for grass seed but for a large
assortment of machines for cutting and plowing and seeding. The newest addition to the
weapons is the use of chemical sprays. Now millions of acres of sagebrush lands are sprayed
each year. What are the results? The eventual effects of eliminating sage and seeding with
grass are largely conjectural. Men of long experience with the ways of the land say that in this
country there is better growth of grass between and under the sage than can possibly be had in
pure stands, once the moisture-holding sage is gone. But even if the program succeeds in its
immediate objective, it is clear that the whole closely knit fabric of life has been ripped apart.
The antelope and the grouse will disappear along with the sage. The deer will suffer, too, and
the land will be poorer for the destruction of the wild things that belong to it. Even the livestock
which are the intended beneficiaries will suffer; no amount of lush green grass in summer can
help the sheep starving in the winter storms for lack of the sage and bitterbrush and other wild
vegetation of the plains. These are the first and obvious effects. The second is of a kind that is

always associated with the shotgun approach to nature: the spraying also eliminates a great
many plants that were not its intended target. Justice William O. Douglas, in his recent book My
Wilderness: East to Katahdin, has told of an appalling example of ecological destruction
wrought by the United States Forest Service in the Bridger National Forest in Wyoming. Some
10,000 acres of sagelands were sprayed by the Service, yielding to pressure of cattlemen for
more grasslands. The sage was killed, as intended. But so was the green, lifegiving ribbon of
willows that traced its way across these plains, following the meandering streams. Moose had
lived in these willow thickets, for willow is to the moose what sage is to the antelope. Beaver
had lived there, too, feeding on the willows, felling them and making a strong dam across the
tiny stream. Through the labor of the beavers, a lake backed up. Trout in the mountain streams
seldom were more than six inches long; in the lake they thrived so prodigiously that many grew
to five pounds. Waterfowl were attracted to the lake, also. Merely because of the presence of
the willows and the beavers that depended on them, the region was an attractive recreational
area with excellent fishing and hunting.
But with the ‘improvement’ instituted by the Forest Service, the willows went the way of the
sagebrush, killed by the same impartial spray. When Justice Douglas visited the area in 1959,
the year of the spraying, he was shocked to see the shriveled and dying willows—the ‘vast,
incredible damage’. What would become of the moose? Of the beavers and the little world
they had constructed? A year later he returned to read the answers in the devastated
landscape. The moose were gone and so were the beaver. Their principal dam had gone out for
want of attention by its skilled architects, and the lake had drained away. None of the large
trout were left. None could live in the tiny creek that remained, threading its way through a
bare, hot land where no shade remained. The living world was shattered. . . .
Besides the more than four million acres of rangelands sprayed each year, tremendous areas of
other types of land are also potential or actual recipients of chemical treatments for weed
control. For example, an area larger than all of New England—some 50 million acres—is under
management by utility corporations and much of it is routinely treated for ‘brush control’. In
the Southwest an estimated 75 million acres of mesquite lands require management by some
means, and chemical spraying is the method most actively pushed. An unknown but very large
acreage of timber-producing lands is now aerially sprayed in order to ‘weed out’ the hardwoods
from the more spray-resistant conifers. Treatment of agricultural lands with herbicides doubled
in the decade following 1949, totaling 53 million acres in 1959. And the combined acreage of
private lawns, parks, and golf courses now being treated must reach an astronomical figure.
The chemical weed killers are a bright new toy. They work in a spectacular way; they give a
giddy sense of power over nature to those who wield them, and as for the long-range and less
obvious effects—these are easily brushed aside as the baseless imaginings of pessimists. The
‘agricultural engineers’ speak blithely of ‘chemical plowing’ in a world that is urged to beat its
plowshares into spray guns. The town fathers of a thousand communities lend willing ears to
the chemical salesman and the eager contractors who will rid the roadsides of ‘brush’—for a
price. It is cheaper than mowing, is the cry. So, perhaps, it appears in the neat rows of figures in
the official books; but were the true costs entered, the costs not only in dollars but in the many
equally valid debits we shall presently consider, the wholesale broadcasting of chemicals would
be seen to be more costly in dollars as well as infinitely damaging to the long-range health of
the landscape and to all the varied interests that depend on it.

Take, for instance, that commodity prized by every chamber of commerce throughout the
land—the good will of vacationing tourists. There is a steadily growing chorus of outraged
protest about the disfigurement of once beautiful roadsides by chemical sprays, which
substitute a sere expanse of brown, withered vegetation for the beauty of fern and wild flower,
of native shrubs adorned with blossom or berry. ‘We are making a dirty, brown, dying-looking
mess along the sides of our roads,’ a New England woman wrote angrily to her newspaper. ‘This
is not what the tourists expect, with all the money we are spending advertising the beautiful
scenery.’
In the summer of 1960 conservationists from many states converged on a peaceful Maine
island to witness its presentation to the National Audubon Society by its owner, Millicent Todd
Bingham. The focus that day was on the preservation of the natural landscape and of the
intricate web of life whose interwoven strands lead from microbes to man. But in the
background of all the conversations among the visitors to the island was indignation at the
despoiling of the roads they had traveled. Once it had been a joy to follow those roads through
the evergreen forests, roads lined with bayberry and sweet fern, alder and huckleberry. Now all
was brown desolation. One of the conservationists wrote of that August pilgrimage to a Maine
island: ‘I returned...angry at the desecration of the Maine roadsides. Where, in previous years,
the highways were bordered with wildflowers and attractive shrubs, there were only the scars
of dead vegetation for mile after mile...As an economic proposition, can Maine afford the loss
of tourist goodwill that such sights induce?’ Maine roadsides are merely one example, though a
particularly sad one for those of us who have a deep love for the beauty of that state, of the
senseless destruction that is going on in the name of roadside brush control throughout the
nation.
Botanists at the Connecticut Arboretum declare that the elimination of beautiful native shrubs
and wildflowers has reached the proportions of a ‘roadside crisis’. Azaleas, mountain laurel,
blueberries, huckleberries, viburnums, dogwood, bayberry, sweet fern, low shadbush,
winterberry, chokecherry, and wild plum are dying before the chemical barrage. So are the
daisies, black-eyed Susans, Queen Anne’s lace, goldenrods, and fall asters which lend grace and
beauty to the landscape. The spraying is not only improperly planned but studded with abuses
such as these. In a southern New England town one contractor finished his work with some
chemical remaining in his tank. He discharged this along woodland roadsides where no spraying
had been authorized. As a result the community lost the blue and golden beauty of its autumn
roads, where asters and goldenrod would have made a display worth traveling far to see. In
another New England community a contractor changed the state specifications for town
spraying without the knowledge of the highway department and sprayed roadside vegetation
to a height of eight feet instead of the specified maximum of four feet, leaving a broad,
disfiguring, brown swath. In a Massachusetts community the town officials purchased a weed
killer from a zealous chemical salesman, unaware that it contained arsenic. One result of the
subsequent roadside spraying was the death of a dozen cows from arsenic poisoning.
Trees within the Connecticut Arboretum Natural Area were seriously injured when the town of
Waterford sprayed the roadsides with chemical weed killers in 1957. Even large trees not
directly sprayed were affected. The leaves of the oaks began to curl and turn brown, although it
was the season for spring growth. Then new shoots began to be put forth and grew with
abnormal rapidity, giving a weeping appearance to the trees. Two seasons later, large branches

on these trees had died, others were without leaves, and the deformed, weeping effect of
whole trees persisted. I know well a stretch of road where nature’s own landscaping has
provided a border of alder, viburnum, sweet fern, and juniper with seasonally changing accents
of bright flowers, or of fruits hanging in jeweled clusters in the fall. The road had no heavy load
of traffic to support; there were few sharp curves or intersections where brush could obstruct
the driver’s vision. But the sprayers took over and the miles along that road became something
to be traversed quickly, a sight to be endured with one’s mind closed to thoughts of the sterile
and hideous world we are letting our technicians make. But here and there authority had
somehow faltered and by an unaccountable oversight there were oases of beauty in the midst
of austere and regimented control—oases that made the desecration of the greater part of the
road the more unbearable. In such places my spirit lifted to the sight of the drifts of white
clover or the clouds of purple vetch with here and there the flaming cup of a wood lily.
Such plants are ‘weeds’ only to those who make a business of selling and applying chemicals. In
a volume of Proceedings of one of the weed-control conferences that are now regular
institutions, I once read an extraordinary statement of a weed killer’s philosophy. The author
defended the killing of good plants ‘simply because they are in bad company.’ Those who
complain about killing wildflowers along roadsides reminded him, he said, of antivivisectionists
‘to whom, if one were to judge by their actions, the life of a stray dog is more sacred than the
lives of children.’ To the author of this paper, many of us would unquestionably be suspect,
convicted of some deep perversion of character because we prefer the sight of the vetch and
the clover and the wood lily in all their delicate and transient beauty to that of roadsides
scorched as by fire, the shrubs brown and brittle, the bracken that once lifted high its
proudlacework now withered and drooping. We would seem deplorably weak that we can
tolerate the sight of such ‘weeds’, that we do not rejoice in their eradication, that we are not
filled with exultation that man has once more triumphed over miscreant nature.
Justice Douglas tells of attending a meeting of federal field men who were discussing protests
by citizens against plans for the spraying of sagebrush that I mentioned earlier in this chapter.
These men considered it hilariously funny that an old lady had opposed the plan because the
wildflowers would be destroyed. ‘Yet, was not her right to search out a banded cup or a tiger
lily as inalienable as the right of stockmen to search out grass or of a lumberman to claim a
tree?’ asks this humane and perceptive jurist. ‘The esthetic values of the wilderness are as
much our inheritance as the veins of copper and gold in our hills and the forests in our
mountains.’ There is of course more to the wish to preserve our roadside vegetation than even
such esthetic considerations. In the economy of nature the natural vegetation has its essential
place. Hedgerows along country roads and bordering fields provide food, cover, and nesting
areas for birds and homes for many small animals. Of some 70 species of shrubs and vines that
are typical roadside species in the eastern states alone, about 65 are important to wildlife as
food. Such vegetation is also the habitat of wild bees and other pollinating insects. Man is more
dependent on these wild pollinators than he usually realizes. Even the farmer himself seldom
understands the value of wild bees and often participates in the very measures that rob him of
their services. Some agricultural crops and many wild plants are partly or wholly dependent on
the services of the native pollinating insects. Several hundred species of wild bees take part in
the pollination of cultivated crops—100 species visiting the flowers of alfalfa alone. Without
insect pollination, most of the soil-holding and soil-enriching plants of uncultivated areas would

die out, with far-reaching consequences to the ecology of the whole region. Many herbs,
shrubs, and trees of forests and range depend on native insects for their reproduction; without
these plants many wild animals and range stock would find little food. Now clean cultivation
and the chemical destruction of hedgerows and weeds are eliminating the last sanctuaries of
these pollinating insects and breaking the threads that bind life to life.
These insects, so essential to our agriculture and indeed to our landscape as we know it,
deserve something better from us than the senseless destruction of their habitat. Honeybees
and wild bees depend heavily on such ‘weeds’ as goldenrod, mustard, and dandelions for pollen
that serves as the food of their young. Vetch furnishes essential spring forage for bees before
the alfalfa is in bloom, tiding them over this early season so that they are ready to pollinate the
alfalfa. In the fall they depend on goldenrod at a season when no other food is available, to
stock up for the winter. By the precise and delicate timing that is nature’s own, the emergence
of one species of wild bees takes place on the very day of the opening of the willow blossoms.
There is no dearth of men who understand these things, but these are not the men who order
the wholesale drenching of the landscape with chemicals.
And where are the men who supposedly understand the value of proper habitat for the
preservation of wildlife? Too many of them are to be found defending herbicides as ‘harmless’
to wildlife because they are thought to be less toxic than insecticides. Therefore, it is said, no
harm is done. But as the herbicides rain down on forest and field, on marsh and rangeland, they
are bringing about marked changes and even permanent destruction of wildlife habitat. To
destroy the homes and the food of wildlife is perhaps worse in the long run than direct killing.
The irony of this all-out chemical assault on roadsides and utility rights-of-way is twofold. It is
perpetuating the problem it seeks to correct, for as experience has clearly shown, the blanket
application of herbicides does not permanently control roadside ‘brush’ and the spraying has to
be repeated year after year. And as a further irony, we persist in doing this despite the fact that
a perfectly sound method of selective spraying is known, which can achieve long-term
vegetational control and eliminate repeated spraying in most types of vegetation. The object of
brush control along roads and rights-of-way is not to sweep the land clear of everything but
grass; it is, rather, to eliminate plants ultimately tall enough to present an obstruction to
drivers’ vision or interference with wires on rights-of-way. This means, in general, trees. Most
shrubs are low enough to present no hazard; so, certainly, are ferns and wildflowers.
Selective spraying was developed by Dr. Frank Egler during a period of years at the American
Museum of Natural History as director of a Committee for Brush Control Recommendations for
Rights-of-Way. It took advantage of the inherent stability of nature, building on the fact that
most communities of shrubs are strongly resistant to invasion by trees. By comparison,
grasslands are easily invaded by tree seedlings. The object of selective spraying is not to
produce grass on roadsides and rights-of-way but to eliminate the tall woody plants by direct
treatment and to preserve all other vegetation. One treatment may be sufficient, with a
possible follow-up for extremely resistant species; thereafter the shrubs assert control and the
trees do not return. The best and cheapest controls for vegetation are not chemicals but other
plants.
The method has been tested in research areas scattered throughout the eastern United States.
Results show that once properly treated, an area becomes stabilized, requiring no respraying
for at least 20 years. The spraying can often be done by men on foot, using knapsack sprayers,

and having complete control over their material. Sometimes compressor pumps and material
can be mounted on truck chassis, but there is no blanket spraying. Treatment is directed only to
trees and any exceptionally tall shrubs that must be eliminated. The integrity of the
environment is thereby preserved, the enormous value of the wildlife habitat remains intact,
and the beauty of shrub and fern and wildflower has not been sacrificed. Here and there the
method of vegetation management by selective spraying has been adopted. For the most part,
entrenched custom dies hard and blanket spraying continues to thrive, to exact its heavy
annual costs from the taxpayer, and to inflict its damage on the ecological web of life. It thrives,
surely, only because the facts are not known. When taxpayers understand that the bill for
spraying the town roads should come due only once a generation instead of once a year, they
will surely rise up and demand a change of method.
Among the many advantages of selective spraying is the fact that it minimizes the amount of
chemical applied to the landscape. There is no broadcasting of material but, rather,
concentrated application to the base of the trees. The potential harm to wildlife is therefore
kept to a minimum. The most widely used herbicides are 2,4-D, 2,4,5-T, and related
compounds. Whether or not these are actually toxic is a matter of controversy. People spraying
their lawns with 2,4-D and becoming wet with spray have occasionally developed severe
neuritis and even paralysis. Although such incidents are apparently uncommon, medical
authorities advise caution in use of such compounds. Other hazards, more obscure, may also
attend the rise of 2,4-D. It has been shown experimentally to disturb the basic physiological
process of respiration in the cell, and to imitate X-rays in damaging the chromosomes. Some
very recent work indicates that reproduction of birds may be adversely affected by these and
certain other herbicides at levels far below those that cause death. Apart from any directly toxic
effects, curious indirect results follow the use of certain herbicides. It has been found that
animals, both wild herbivores and livestock, are sometimes strangely attracted to a plant that
has been sprayed, even though it is not one of their natural foods. If a highly poisonous
herbicide such as arsenic has been used, this intense desire to reach the wilting vegetation
inevitably has disastrous results. Fatal results may follow, also, from less toxic herbicides if the
plant itself happens to be poisonous or perhaps to possess thorns or burs. Poisonous range
weeds, for example, have suddenly become attractive to livestock after spraying, and the
animals have died from indulging this unnatural appetite. The literature of veterinary medicine
abounds in similar examples: swine eating sprayed cockleburs with consequent severe illness,
lambs eating sprayed thistles, bees poisoned by pasturing on mustard sprayed after it came
into bloom. Wild cherry, the leaves of which are highly poisonous, has exerted a fatal attraction
for cattle once its foliage has been sprayed with 2,4-D. Apparently the wilting that follows
spraying (or cutting) makes the plant attractive. Ragwort has provided other examples.
Livestock ordinarily avoid this plant unless forced to turn to it in late winter and early spring by
lack of other forage. However, the animals eagerly feed on it after its foliage has been sprayed
with 2,4-D. The explanation of this peculiar behavior sometimes appears to lie in the changes
which the chemical brings about in the metabolism of the plant itself. There is temporarily a
marked increase in sugar content, making the plant more attractive to many animals.
Another curious effect of 2,4-D has important effects for livestock, wildlife, and apparently for
men as well. Experiments carried out about a decade ago showed that after treatment with this
chemical there is a sharp increase in the nitrate content of corn and of sugar beets. The same

effect was suspected in sorghum, sunflower, spiderwort, lambs quarters, pigweed, and
smartweed. Some of these are normally ignored by cattle, but are eaten with relish after
treatment with 2,4-D. A number of deaths among cattle have been traced to sprayed weeds,
according to some agricultural specialists. The danger lies in the increase in nitrates, for the
peculiar physiology of the ruminant at once poses a critical problem. Most such animals have a
digestive system of extraordinary complexity, including a stomach divided into four chambers.
The digestion of cellulose is accomplished through the action of micro-organisms (rumen
bacteria) in one of the chambers. When the animal feeds on vegetation containing an
abnormally high level of nitrates, the micro-organisms in the rumen act on the nitrates to
change them into highly toxic nitrites. Thereafter a fatal chain of events ensues: the nitrites act
on the blood pigment to form a chocolate-brown substance in which the oxygen is so firmly
held that it cannot take part in respiration, hence oxygen is not transferred from the lungs to
the tissues. Death occurs within a few hours from anoxia, or lack of oxygen. The various reports
of livestock losses after grazing on certain weeds treated with 2,4-D therefore have a logical
explanation. The same danger exists for wild animals belonging to the group of ruminants, such
as deer, antelope, sheep, and goats. Although various factors (such as exceptionally dry
weather) can cause an increase in nitrate content, the effect of the soaring sales and
applications of 2,4-D cannot be ignored. The situation was considered important enough by the
University of Wisconsin Agricultural Experiment Station to justify a warning in 1957 that ‘plants
killed by 2,4-D may contain large amounts of nitrate.’ The hazard extends to human beings as
well as animals and may help to explain the recent mysterious increase in ‘silo deaths’. When
corn, oats, or sorghum containing large amounts of nitrates are ensiled they release poisonous
nitrogen oxide gases, creating a deadly hazard to anyone entering the silo. Only a few breaths
of one of these gases can cause a diffuse chemical pneumonia. In a series of such cases studied
by the University of Minnesota Medical School all but one terminated fatally. . . .
‘Once again we are walking in nature like an elephant in the china cabinet.’ So C. J. Briejèr, a
Dutch scientist of rare understanding, sums up our use of weed killers. ‘In my opinion too much
is taken for granted. We do not know whether all weeds in crops are harmful or whether some
of them are useful,’ says Dr. Briejèr. Seldom is the question asked, What is the relation between
the weed and the soil? Perhaps, even from our narrow standpoint of direct self-interest, the
relation is a useful one. As we have seen, soil and the living things in and upon it exist in a
relation of interdependence and mutual benefit. Presumably the weed is taking something
from the soil; perhaps it is also contributing something to it. A practical example was provided
recently by the parks in a city in Holland. The roses were doing badly. Soil samples showed
heavy infestations by tiny nematode worms. Scientists of the Dutch Plant Protection Service did
not recommend chemical sprays or soil treatments; instead, they suggested that marigolds be
planted among the roses. This plant, which the purist would doubtless consider a weed in any
rose bed, releases an excretion from its roots that kills the soil nematodes. The advice was
taken; some beds were planted with marigolds, some left without as controls. The results were
striking. With the aid of the marigolds the roses flourished; in the control beds they were sickly
and drooping. Marigolds are now used in many places for combating nematodes. In the same
way, and perhaps quite unknown to us, other plants that we ruthlessly eradicate may be
performing a function that is necessary to the health of the soil. One very useful function of
natural plant communities—now pretty generally stigmatized as ‘weeds’—is to serve as an

indicator of the condition of the soil. This useful function is of course lost where chemical weed
killers have been used. Those who find an answer to all problems in spraying also overlook a
matter of great scientific importance—the need to preserve some natural plant communities.
We need these as a standard against which we can measure the changes our own activities
bring about. We need them as wild habitats in which original populations of insects and other
organisms can be maintained, for, as will be explained in Chapter 16, the development of
resistance to insecticides is changing the genetic factors of insects and perhaps other
organisms. One scientist has even suggested that some sort of ‘zoo’ should be established to
preserve insects, mites, and the like, before their genetic composition is further changed. Some
experts warn of subtle but far-reaching vegetational shifts as a result of the growing use of
herbicides. The chemical 2,4-D, by killing out the broad-leaved plants, allows the grasses to
thrive in the reduced competition—now some of the grasses themselves have become ‘weeds’,
presenting a new problem in control and giving the cycle another turn. This strange situation is
acknowledged in a recent issue of a journal devoted to crop problems: ‘With the widespread
use of 2,4-D to control broadleaved weeds, grass weeds in particular have increasingly become
a threat to corn and soybean yields.’
Ragweed, the bane of hay fever sufferers, offers an interesting example of the way efforts to
control nature sometimes boomerang. Many thousands of gallons of chemicals have been
discharged along roadsides in the name of ragweed control. But the unfortunate truth is that
blanket spraying is resulting in more ragweed, not less. Ragweed is an annual; its seedlings
require open soil to become established each year. Our best protection against this plant is
therefore the maintenance of dense shrubs, ferns, and other perennial vegetation. Spraying
frequently destroys this protective vegetation and creates open, barren areas which the
ragweed hastens to fill. It is probable, moreover, that the pollen content of the atmosphere is
not related to roadside ragweed, but to the ragweed of city lots and fallow fields. The booming
sales of chemical crabgrass killers are another example of how readily unsound methods catch
on. There is a cheaper and better way to remove crabgrass than to attempt year after year to
kill it out with chemicals. This is to give it competition of a kind it cannot survive, the
competition of other grass. Crabgrass exists only in an unhealthy lawn. It is a symptom, not a
disease in itself. By providing a fertile soil and giving the desired grasses a good start, it is
possible to create an environment in which crabgrass cannot grow, for it requires open space in
which it can start from seed year after year.
Instead of treating the basic condition, suburbanites—advised by nurserymen who in turn have
been advised by the chemical manufacturers—continue to apply truly astonishing amounts of
crabgrass killers to their lawns each year. Marketed under trade names which give no hint of
their nature, many of these preparations contain such poisons as mercury, arsenic, and
chlordane. Application at the recommended rates leaves tremendous amounts of these
chemicals on the lawn. Users of one product, for example, apply 60 pounds of technical
chlordane to the acre if they follow directions. If they use another of the many available
products, they are applying 175 pounds of metallic arsenic to the acre. The toll of dead birds, as
we shall see in Chapter 8, is distressing. How lethal these lawns may be for human beings is
unknown. The success of selective spraying for roadside and right-of-way vegetation, where it
has been practiced, offers hope that equally sound ecological methods may be developed for
other vegetation programs for farms, forests, and ranges— methods aimed not at destroying a

particular species but at managing vegetation as a living community. Other solid achievements
show what can be done. Biological control has achieved some of its most spectacular successes
in the area of curbing unwanted vegetation. Nature herself has met many of the problems that
now beset us, and she has usually solved them in her own successful way. Where man has been
intelligent enough to observe and to emulate Nature he, too, is often rewarded with success.
An outstanding example in the field of controlling unwanted plants is the handling of the
Klamath-weed problem in California. Although the Klamath weed, or goatweed, is a native of
Europe (where it is called St. Johnswort), it accompanied man in his westward migrations, first
appearing in the United States in 1793 near Lancaster, Pennsylvania. By 1900 it had reached
California in the vicinity of the Klamath River, hence the name locally given to it. By 1929 it had
occupied about 100,000 acres of rangeland, and by 1952 it had invaded some two and one half
million acres.
Klamath weed, quite unlike such native plants as sagebrush, has no place in the ecology of the
region, and no animals or other plants require its presence. On the contrary, wherever it
appeared livestock became ‘scabby, sore-mouthed, and unthrifty’ from feeding on this toxic
plant. Land values declined accordingly, for the Klamath weed was considered to hold the first
mortgage. In Europe the Klamath weed, or St. Johnswort, has never become a problem because
along with the plant there have developed various species of insects; these feed on it so
extensively that its abundance is severely limited. In particular, two species of beetles in
southern France, pea-sized and of metallic colour have their whole beings so adapted to the
presence of the weed that they feed and reproduce only upon it. It was an event of historic
importance when the first shipments of these beetles were brought to the United States in
1944, for this was the first attempt in North America to control a plant with a plant-eating
insect. By 1948 both species had become so well established that no further importations were
needed. Their spread was accomplished by collecting beetle from the original colonies and
redistributing them at the rate of millions a year. Within small areas the beetles accomplish
their own dispersion, moving on as soon as the Klamath weed dies out and locating new stands
with great precision. And as the beetles thin out the weed, desirable range plants that have
been crowded out are able to return. A ten-year survey completed in 1959 showed that control
of the Klamath weed had been ‘more effective than hoped for even by enthusiasts’, with the
weed reduced to a mere 1 per cent of its former abundance. This token infestation is harmless
and is actually needed in order to maintain a population of beetles as protection against a
future increase in the weed.
Another extraordinarily successful and economical example of weed control may be found in
Australia. With the colonists’ usual taste for carrying plants or animals into a new country, a
Captain Arthur Phillip had brought various species of cactus into Australia about 1787,
intending to use them in culturing cochineal insects for dye. Some of the cacti or prickly pears
escaped from his gardens and by 1925 about 20 species could be found growing wild. Having no
natural controls in this new territory, they spread prodigiously, eventually occupying about 60
million acres. At least half of this land was so densely covered as to be useless. In 1920
Australian entomologists were sent to North and South America to study insect enemies of the
prickly pears in their native habitat. After trials of several species, 3 billion eggs of an Argentine
moth were released in Australia in 1930. Seven years later the last dense growth of the prickly
pear had been destroyed and the once uninhabitable areas reopened to settlement and

grazing. The whole operation had cost less than a penny per acre. In contrast, the
unsatisfactory attempts at chemical control in earlier years had cost about £10 per acre.
Both of these examples suggest that extremely effective control of many kinds of unwanted
vegetation might be achieved by paying more attention to the role of plant-eating insects. The
science of range management has largely ignored this possibility, although these insects are
perhaps the most selective of all grazers and their highly restricted diets could easily be turned
to man’s advantage.

7. Needless Havoc
AS MAN PROCEEDS toward his announced goal of the conquest of nature, he has
written a depressing record of destruction, directed not only against the earth he inhabits but
against the life that shares it with him. The history of the recent centuries has its black
passages—the slaughter of the buffalo on the western plains, the massacre of the shorebirds by
the market gunners, the near-extermination of the egrets for their plumage. Now, to these and
others like them, we are adding a new chapter and a new kind of havoc—the direct killing of
birds, mammals, fishes, and indeed practically every form of wildlife by chemical insecticides
indiscriminately sprayed on the land. Under the philosophy that now seems to guide our
destinies, nothing must get in the way of the man with the spray gun. The incidental victims of
his crusade against insects count as nothing; if robins, pheasants, raccoons, cats, or even
livestock happen to inhabit the same bit of earth as the target insects and to be hit by the rain
of insect-killing poisons no one must protest.
The citizen who wishes to make a fair judgment of the question of wildlife loss is today
confronted with a dilemma. On the one hand conservationists and many wildlife biologists
assert that the losses have been severe and in some cases even catastrophic. On the other hand
the control agencies tend to deny flatly and categorically that such losses have occurred, or that
they are of any importance if they have. Which view are we to accept? The credibility of the
witness is of first importance. The professional wildlife biologist on the scene is certainly best
qualified to discover and interpret wildlife loss. The entomologist, whose specialty is insects, is
not so qualified by training, and is not psychologically disposed to look for undesirable side
effects of his control program. Yet it is the control men in state and federal governments—and
of course the chemical manufacturers—who steadfastly deny the facts reported by the
biologists and declare they see little evidence of harm to wildlife. Like the priest and the Levite
in the biblical story, they choose to pass by on the other side and to see nothing. Even if we
charitably explain their denials as due to the shortsightedness of the specialist and the man
with an interest this does not mean we must accept them as qualified witnesses.
The best way to form our own judgment is to look at some of the major control programs and
learn, from observers familiar with the ways of wildlife, and unbiased in favor of chemicals, just
what has happened in the wake of a rain of poison falling from the skies into the world of
wildlife. To the bird watcher, the suburbanite who derives joy from birds in his garden, the
hunter, the fisherman or the explorer of wild regions, anything that destroys the wildlife of an
area for even a single year has deprived him of pleasure to which he has a legitimate right. This
is a valid point of view. Even if, as has sometimes happened, some of the birds and mammals
and fishes are able to re-establish themselves after a single spraying, a great and real harm has
been done. But such reestablishment is unlikely to happen. Spraying tends to be repetitive, and
a single exposure from which the wildlife populations might have a chance to recover is a rarity.
What usually results is a poisoned environment, a lethal trap in which not only the resident
populations succumb but those who come in as migrants as well. The larger the area sprayed
the more serious the harm, because no oases of safety remain. Now, in a decade marked by
insect-control programs in which many thousands or even millions of acres are sprayed as a
unit, a decade in which private and community spraying has also surged steadily upward, a

record of destruction and death of American wildlife has accumulated. Let us look at some of
these programs and see what has happened.
During the fall of 1959 some 27,000 acres in southeastern Michigan, including numerous
suburbs of Detroit, were heavily dusted from the air with pellets of aldrin, one of the most
dangerous of all the chlorinated hydrocarbons. The program was conducted by the Michigan
Department of Agriculture with the cooperation of the United States Department of
Agriculture; its announced purpose was control of the Japanese beetle. Little need was shown
for this drastic and dangerous action. On the contrary, Walter P. Nickell, one of the best-known
and best-informed naturalists in the state, who spends much of his time in the field with long
periods in southern Michigan every summer, declared: ‘For more than thirty years, to my direct
knowledge, the Japanese beetle has been present in the city of Detroit in small numbers. The
numbers have not shown any appreciable increase in all this lapse of years. I have yet to see a
single Japanese beetle [in 1959] other than the few caught in Government catch traps in
Detroit...Everything is being kept so secret that I have not yet been able to obtain any
information whatsoever to the effect that they have increased in numbers.’ An official release
by the state agency merely declared that the beetle had ‘put in its appearance’ in the areas
designated for the aerial attack upon it. Despite the lack of justification the program was
launched, with the state providing the manpower and supervising the operation, the federal
government providing equipment and additional men, and the communities paying for the
insecticide. The Japanese beetle, an insect accidentally imported into the United States, was
discovered in New Jersey in 1916, when a few shiny beetles of a metallic green color were seen
in a nursery near Riverton. The beetles, at first unrecognized, were finally identified as a
common inhabitant of the main islands of Japan. Apparently they had entered the United
States on nursery stock imported before restrictions were established in 1912.
From its original point of entrance the Japanese beetle has spread rather widely throughout
many of the states east of the Mississippi, where conditions of temperature and rainfall are
suitable for it. Each year some outward movement beyond the existing boundaries of its
distribution usually takes place. In the eastern areas where the beetles have been longest
established, attempts have been made to set up natural controls. Where this has been done,
the beetle populations have been kept at relatively low levels, as many records attest. Despite
the record of reasonable control in eastern areas, the midwestern states now on the fringe of
the beetle’s range have launched an attack worthy of the most deadly enemy instead of only a
moderately destructive insect, employing the most dangerous chemicals distributed in a
manner that exposes large numbers of people, their domestic animals, and all wildlife to the
poison intended for the beetle. As a result these Japanese beetle programs have caused
shocking destruction of animal life and have exposed human beings to undeniable hazard.
Sections of Michigan, Kentucky, Iowa, Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri are all experiencing a rain
of chemicals in the name of beetle control. The Michigan spraying was one of the first largescale attacks on the Japanese beetle from the air. The choice of aldrin, one of the deadliest of
all chemicals, was not determined by any peculiar suitability for Japanese beetle control, but
simply by the wish to save money—aldrin was the cheapest of the compounds available. While
the state in its official release to the press acknowledged that aldrin is a ‘poison’, it implied that
no harm could come to human beings in the heavily populated areas to which the chemical was
applied. (The official answer to the query ‘What precautions should I take?’ was ‘For you,

none.’) An official of the Federal Aviation Agency was later quoted in the local press to the
effect that ‘this is a safe operation’ and a representative of the Detroit Department of Parks and
Recreation added his assurance that ‘the dust is harmless to humans and will not hurt plants or
pets.’ One must assume that none of these officials had consulted the published and readily
available reports of the United States Public Health Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and
other evidence of the extremely poisonous nature of aldrin.
Acting under the Michigan pest control law which allows the state to spray indiscriminately
without notifying or gaining permission of individual landowners, the low-lying planes began to
fly over the Detroit area. The city authorities and the Federal Aviation Agency were
immediately besieged by calls from worried citizens. After receiving nearly 800 calls in a single
hour, the police begged radio and television stations and newspapers to ‘tell the watchers what
they were seeing and advise them it was safe,’ according to the Detroit News. The Federal
Aviation Agency’s safety officer assured the public that ‘the planes are carefully supervised’ and
‘are authorized to fly low.’ In a somewhat mistaken attempt to allay fears, he added that the
planes had emergency valves that would allow them to dump their entire load instantaneously.
This, fortunately, was not done, but as the planes went about their work the pellets of
insecticide fell on beetles and humans alike, showers of ‘harmless’ poison descending on
people shopping or going to work and on children out from school for the lunch hour.
Housewives swept the granules from porches and sidewalks, where they are said to have
‘looked like snow’. As pointed out later by the Michigan Audubon Society, ‘In the spaces
between shingles on roofs, in eaves-troughs, in the cracks in bark and twigs, the little white
pellets of aldrin-and-clay, no bigger than a pin head, were lodged by the millions...When the
snow and rain came, every puddle became a possible death potion.’ Within a few days after the
dusting operation, the Detroit Audubon Society began receiving calls about the birds. According
to the Society’s secretary, Mrs. Ann Boyes, ‘The first indication that the people were concerned
about the spray was a call I received on Sunday morning from a woman who reported that
coming home from church she saw an alarming number of dead and dying birds. The spraying
there had been done on Thursday. She said there were no birds at all flying in the area, that she
had found at least a dozen [dead] in her backyard and that the neighbors had found dead
squirrels.’ All other calls received by Mrs. Boyes that day reported ‘a great many dead birds and
no live ones... People who had maintained bird feeders said there were no birds at all at their
feeders.’ Birds picked up in a dying condition showed the typical symptoms of insecticide
poisoning—tremoring, loss of ability to fly, paralysis, convulsions.
Nor were birds the only forms of life immediately affected. A local veterinarian reported that
his office was full of clients with dogs and cats that had suddenly sickened. Cats, who so
meticulously groom their coats and lick their paws, seemed to be most affected. Their illness
took the form of severe diarrhea, vomiting, and convulsions. The only advice the veterinarian
could give his clients was not to let the animals out unnecessarily, or to wash the paws
promptly if they did so. (But the chlorinated hydrocarbons cannot be washed even from fruits
or vegetables, so little protection could be expected from this measure.)
Despite the insistence of the City-County Health Commissioner that the birds must have been
killed by ‘some other kind of spraying’ and that the outbreak of throat and chest irritations that
followed the exposure to aldrin must have been due to ‘something else’, the local Health
Department received a constant stream of complaints. A prominent Detroit internist was called

upon to treat four of his patients within an hour after they had been exposed while watching
the planes at work. All had similar symptoms: nausea, vomiting, chills, fever, extreme fatigue,
and coughing. The Detroit experience has been repeated in many other communities as
pressure has mounted to combat the Japanese beetle with chemicals. At Blue Island, Illinois,
hundreds of dead and dying birds were picked up. Data collected by birdbanders here suggest
that 80 per cent of the songbirds were sacrificed. In Joliet, Illinois, some 3000 acres were
treated with heptachlor in 1959. According to reports from a local sportsmen’s club, the bird
population within the treated area was ‘virtually wiped out’. Dead rabbits, muskrats, opossums,
and fish were also found in numbers, and one of the local schools made the collection of
insecticide-poisoned birds a science project. . . .
Perhaps no community has suffered more for the sake of a beetleless world than Sheldon, in
eastern Illinois, and adjacent areas in Iroquois County. In 1954 the United States Department of
Agriculture and the Illinois Agriculture Department began a program to eradicate the Japanese
beetle along the line of its advance into Illinois, holding out the hope, and indeed the
assurance, that intensive spraying would destroy the populations of the invading insect. The
first ‘eradication’ took place that year, when dieldrin was applied to 1400 acres by air. Another
2600 acres were treated similarly in 1955, and the task was presumably considered complete.
But more and more chemical treatments were called for, and by the end of 1961 some 131,000
acres had been covered. Even in the first years of the program it was apparent that heavy
losses were occurring among wildlife and domestic animals. The chemical treatments were
continued, nevertheless, without consultation with either the United States Fish and Wildlife
Service or the Illinois Game Management Division. (In the spring of 1960, however, officials of
the federal Department of Agriculture appeared before a congressional committee in
opposition to a bill that would require just such prior consultation. They declared blandly that
the bill was unnecessary because cooperation and consultation were ‘usual’. These officials
were quite unable to recall situations where cooperation had not taken place ‘at the
Washington level’. In the same hearings they stated clearly their unwillingness to consult with
state fish and game departments.) Although funds for chemical control came in never-ending
streams, the biologists of the Illinois Natural History Survey who attempted to measure the
damage to wildlife had to operate on a financial shoestring. A mere $1100 was available for the
employment of a field assistant in 1954 and no special funds were provided in 1955. Despite
these crippling difficulties, the biologists assembled facts that collectively paint a picture of
almost unparalleled wildlife destruction—destruction that became obvious as soon as the
program got under way.
Conditions were made to order for poisoning insect-eating birds, both in the poisons used and
in the events set in motion by their application. In the early programs at Sheldon, dieldrin was
applied at the rate of 3 pounds to the acre. To understand its effect on birds one need only
remember that in laboratory experiments on quail dieldrin has proved to be about 50 times as
poisonous as DDT. The poison spread over the landscape at Sheldon was therefore roughly
equivalent to 150 pounds of DDT per acre! And this was a minimum, because there seems to
have been some overlapping of treatments along field borders and in corners. As the chemical
penetrated the soil the poisoned beetle grubs crawled out on the surface of the ground, where
they remained for some time before they died, attractive to insect-eating birds. Dead and dying
insects of various species were conspicuous for about two weeks after the treatment. The

effect on the bird populations could easily have been foretold. Brown thrashers, starlings,
meadowlarks, grackles, and pheasants were virtually wiped out. Robins were ‘almost
annihilated’, according to the biologists’ report. Dead earthworms had been seen in numbers
after a gentle rain; probably the robins had fed on the poisoned worms. For other birds, too,
the once beneficial rain had been changed, through the evil power of the poison introduced
into their world, into an agent of destruction. Birds seen drinking and bathing in puddles left by
rain a few days after the spraying were inevitably doomed.
The birds that survived may have been rendered sterile. Although a few nests were found in the
treated area, a few with eggs, none contained young birds. Among the mammals ground
squirrels were virtually annihilated; their bodies were found in attitudes characteristic of violent
death by poisoning. Dead muskrats were found in the treated areas, dead rabbits in the fields.
The fox squirrel had been a relatively common animal in the town; after the spraying it was
gone. It was a rare farm in the Sheldon area that was blessed by the presence of a cat after the
war on beetles was begun. Ninety per cent of all the farm cats fell victims to the dieldrin during
the first season of spraying. This might have been predicted because of the black record of
these poisons in other places. Cats are extremely sensitive to all insecticides and especially so, it
seems, to dieldrin. In western Java in the course of the antimalarial program carried out by the
World Health Organization, many cats are reported to have died. In central Java so many were
killed that the price of a cat more than doubled. Similarly, the World Health Organization,
spraying in Venezuela, is reported to have reduced cats to the status of a rare animal.
In Sheldon it was not only the wild creatures and the domestic companions that were sacrificed
in the campaign against an insect. Observations on several flocks of sheep and a herd of beef
cattle are indicative of the poisoning and death that threatened livestock as well. The Natural
History Survey report describes one of these episodes as follows:
The sheep...were driven into a small, untreated bluegrass pasture across a gravel road from a field which
had been treated with dieldrin spray on May 6. Evidently some spray had drifted across the road into the pasture,
for the sheep began to show symptoms of intoxication almost at once...They lost interest in food and displayed
extreme restlessness, following the pasture fence around and around apparently searching for a way out...They
refused to be driven, bleated almost continuously, and stood with their heads lowered; they were finally carried
from the pasture...They displayed great desire for water. Two of the sheep wer e found dead in the stream passing
through the pasture, and the r emaining sheep were repeatedly driven out of the stream, several having to be
dragged forcibly from the water. Three of the sheep eventually died; those remaining recovered to all outward
appearances.

This, then, was the picture at the end of 1955. Although the chemical war went on in
succeeding years, the trickle of research funds dried up completely. Requests for money for
wildlife-insecticide research were included in annual budgets submitted to the Illinois
legislature by the Natural History Survey, but were invariably among the first items to be
eliminated. It was not until 1960 that money was somehow found to pay the expenses of one
field assistant—to do work that could easily have occupied the time of four men.
The desolate picture of wildlife loss had changed little when the biologists resumed the studies
broken off in 1955. In the meantime, the chemical had been changed to the even more toxic
aldrin, 100 to 300 times as toxic as DDT in tests on quail. By 1960, every species of wild mammal
known to inhabit the area had suffered losses. It was even worse with the birds. In the small
town of Donovan the robins had been wiped out, as had the grackles, starlings, and brown

thrashers. These and many other birds were sharply reduced elsewhere. Pheasant hunters felt
the effects of the beetle campaign sharply. The number of broods produced on treated lands
fell off by some 50 per cent, and the number of young in a brood declined. Pheasant hunting,
which had been good in these areas in former years, was virtually abandoned as unrewarding.
In spite of the enormous havoc that had been wrought in the name of eradicating the Japanese
beetle, the treatment of more than 100,000 acres in Iroquois County over an eight-year period
seems to have resulted in only temporary suppression of the insect, which continues its
westward movement. The full extent of the toll that has been taken by this largely ineffective
program may never be known, for the results measured by the Illinois biologists are a minimum
figure. If the research program had been adequately financed to permit full coverage, the
destruction revealed would have been even more appalling. But in the eight years of the
program, only about $6000 was provided for biological field studies. Meanwhile the federal
government had spent about $375,000 for control work and additional thousands had been
provided by the state. The amount spent for research was therefore a small fraction of 1 per
cent of the outlay for the chemical program.
These midwestern programs have been conducted in a spirit of crisis, as though the advance of
the beetle presented an extreme peril justifying any means to combat it. This of course is a
distortion of the facts, and if the communities that have endured these chemical drenchings
had been familiar with the earlier history of the Japanese beetle in the United States they
would surely have been less acquiescent. The eastern states, which had the good fortune to
sustain their beetle invasion in the days before the synthetic insecticides had been invented,
have not only survived the invasion but have brought the insect under control by means that
represented no threat whatever to other forms of life. There has been nothing comparable to
the Detroit or Sheldon sprayings in the East. The effective methods there involved the bringing
into play of natural forces of control which have the multiple advantages of permanence and
environmental safety. During the first dozen years after its entry into the United States, the
beetle increased rapidly, free of the restraints that in its native land hold it in check. But by
1945 it had become a pest of only minor importance throughout much of the territory over
which it had spread. Its decline was largely a consequence of the importation of parasitic
insects from the Far East and of the establishment of disease organisms fatal to it.
Between 1920 and 1933, as a result of diligent searching throughout the native range of the
beetle, some 34 species of predatory or parasitic insects had been imported from the Orient in
an effort to establish natural control. Of these, five became well established in the eastern
United States. The most effective and widely distributed is a parasitic wasp from Korea and
China, Tiphia vernalis. The female Tiphia, finding a beetle grub in the soil, injects a paralyzing
fluid and attaches a single egg to the undersurface of the grub. The young wasp, hatching as a
larva, feeds on the paralyzed grub and destroys it. In some 25 years, colonies of Tiphia were
introduced into 14 eastern states in a cooperative program of state and federal agencies. The
wasp became widely established in this area and is generally credited by entomologists with an
important role in bringing the beetle under control. An even more important role has been
played by a bacterial disease that affects beetles of the family to which the Japanese beetle
belongs—the scarabaeids. It is a highly specific organism, attacking no other type of insects,
harmless to earthworms, warm-blooded animals, and plants. The spores of the disease occur in

soil. When ingested by a foraging beetle grub they multiply prodigiously in its blood, causing it
to turn an abnormally white color, hence the popular name, ‘milky disease’.
Milky disease was discovered in New Jersey in 1933. By 1938 it was rather widely prevalent in
the older areas of Japanese beetle infestation. In 1939 a control program was launched,
directed at speeding up the spread of the disease. No method had been developed for growing
the disease organism in an artificial medium, but a satisfactory substitute was evolved; infected
grubs are ground up, dried, and combined with chalk. In the standard mixture a gram of dust
contains 100 million spores. Between 1939 and 1953 some 94,000 acres in 14 eastern states
were treated in a cooperative federal state program; other areas on federal lands were treated;
and an unknown but extensive area was treated by private organizations or individuals. By
1945, milky spore disease was raging among the beetle populations of Connecticut, New York,
New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland. In some test areas infection of grubs had reached as high
as 94 per cent. The distribution program was discontinued as a governmental enterprise in
1953 and production was taken over by a private laboratory, which continues to supply
individuals, garden clubs, citizens’ associations, and all others interested in beetle control.
The eastern areas where this program was carried out now enjoy a high degree of natural
protection from the beetle. The organism remains viable in the soil for years and therefore
becomes to all intents and purposes permanently established, increasing in effectiveness, and
being continuously spread by natural agencies. Why, then, with this impressive record in the
East, were the same procedures not tried in Illinois and the other mid-western states where the
chemical battle of the beetles is now being waged with such fury?
We are told that inoculation with milky spore disease is ‘too expensive’—although no one
found it so in the 14 eastern states in the 1940s. And by what sort of accounting was the ‘too
expensive’ judgment reached? Certainly not by any that assessed the true costs of the total
destruction wrought by such programs as the Sheldon spraying. This judgment also ignores the
fact that inoculation with the spores need be done only once; the first cost is the only cost. We
are told also that milky spore disease cannot be used on the periphery of the beetle’s range
because it can be established only where a large grub population is already present in the soil.
Like many other statements in support of spraying, this one needs to be questioned. The
bacterium that causes milky spore disease has been found to infect at least 40 other species of
beetles which collectively have quite a wide distribution and would in all probability serve to
establish the disease even where the Japanese beetle population is very small or nonexistent.
Furthermore, because of the long viability of the spores in soil they can be introduced even in
the complete absence of grubs, as on the fringe of the present beetle infestation, there to await
the advancing population.
Those who want immediate results, at whatever cost, will doubtless continue to use chemicals
against the beetle. So will those who favor the modern trend to built-in obsolescence, for
chemical control is self-perpetuating, needing frequent and costly repetition. On the other
hand, those who are willing to wait an extra season or two for full results will turn to milky
disease; they will be rewarded with lasting control that becomes more, rather than less
effective with the passage of time.
An extensive program of research is under way in the United States Department of Agriculture
laboratory at Peoria, Illinois, to find a way to culture the organism of milky disease on an
artificial medium. This will greatly reduce its cost and should encourage its more extensive use.

After years of work, some success has now been reported. When this ‘breakthrough’ is
thoroughly established perhaps some sanity and perspective will be restored to our dealings
with the Japanese beetle, which at the peak of its depredations never justified the nightmare
excesses of some of these Midwestern programs. . . .
Incidents like the eastern Illinois spraying raise a question that is not only scientific but moral.
The question is whether any civilization can wage relentless war on life without destroying
itself, and without losing the right to be called civilized. These insecticides are not selective
poisons; they do not single out the one species of which we desire to be rid. Each of them is
used for the simple reason that it is a deadly poison. It therefore poisons all life with which it
comes in contact: the cat beloved of some family, the farmer’s cattle, the rabbit in the field, and
the horned lark out of the sky. These creatures are innocent of any harm to man. Indeed, by
their very existence they and their fellows make his life more pleasant. Yet he rewards them
with a death that is not only sudden but horrible. Scientific observers at Sheldon described the
symptoms of a meadowlark found near death: ‘Although it lacked muscular coordination and
could not fly or stand, it continued to beat its wings and clutch with its toes while lying on its
side. Its beak was held open and breathing was labored.’ Even more pitiful was the mute
testimony of the dead ground squirrels, which ‘exhibited a characteristic attitude in death. The
back was bowed, and the forelegs with the toes of the feet tightly clenched were drawn close
to the thorax...The head and neck were outstretched and the mouth often contained dirt,
suggesting that the dying animal had been biting at the ground.’
By acquiescing in an act that can cause such suffering to a living creature, who among us is not
diminished as a human being?

8. And No Birds Sing
OVER INCREASINGLY large areas of the United States, spring now comes unheralded by
the return of the birds, and the early mornings are strangely silent where once they were filled
with the beauty of bird song. This sudden silencing of the song of birds, this obliteration of the
color and beauty and interest they lend to our world have come about swiftly, insidiously, and
unnoticed by those whose communities are as yet unaffected. From the town of Hinsdale,
Illinois, a housewife wrote in despair to one of the world’s leading ornithologists, Robert
Cushman Murphy, Curator Emeritus of Birds at the American Museum of Natural History.
Here in our village the elm trees have been sprayed for several years [she wrote in 1958]. When
we moved here six years ago, there was a wealth of bird life; I put up a feeder and had a steady
stream of cardinals, chickadees, downies and nuthatches all winter, and the cardinals and
chickadees brought their young ones in the summer. After several years of DDT spray, the town
is almost devoid of robins and starlings; chickadees have not been on my shelf for two years,
and this year the cardinals are gone too; the nesting population in the neighborhood seems to
consist of one dove pair and perhaps one catbird family.
It is hard to explain to the children that the birds have been killed off, when they have learned
in school that a Federal law protects the birds from killing or capture. ‘Will they ever come
back?’ they ask, and I do not have the answer. The elms are still dying, and so are the birds. Is
anything being done? Can anything be done? Can I do anything? A year after the federal
government had launched a massive spraying program against the fire ant, an Alabama woman
wrote: ‘Our place has been a veritable bird sanctuary for over half a century. Last July we all
remarked, “There are more birds than ever.” Then, suddenly, in the second week of August,
they all disappeared. I was accustomed to rising early to care for my favorite mare that had a
young filly. There was not a sound of the song of a bird. It was eerie, terrifying. What was man
doing to our perfect and beautiful world? Finally, five months later a blue jay appeared and a
wren.’ The autumn months to which she referred brought other somber reports from the deep
South, where in Mississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama the Field Notes published quarterly by the
National Audubon Society and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service noted the striking
phenomenon of ‘blank spots weirdly empty of virtually all bird life’. The Field Notes are a
compilation of the reports of seasoned observers who have spent many years afield in their
particular areas and have unparalleled knowledge of the normal bird life of the region. One
such observer reported that in driving about southern Mississippi that fall she saw ‘no land
birds at all for long distances’. Another in Baton Rouge reported that the contents of her
feeders had lain untouched ‘for weeks on end’, while fruiting shrubs in her yard, that ordinarily
would be stripped clean by that time, still were laden with berries. Still another reported that
his picture window, ‘which often used to frame a scene splashed with the red of 40 or 50
cardinals and crowded with other species, seldom permitted a view of as many as a bird or two
at a time.’ Professor Maurice Brooks of the University of West Virginia, an authority on the
birds of the Appalachian region, reported that the West Virginia bird population had undergone
‘an incredible reduction’. One story might serve as the tragic symbol of the fate of the birds—a
fate that has already overtaken some species, and that threatens all. It is the story of the robin,

the bird known to everyone. To millions of Americans, the season’s first robin means that the
grip of winter is broken. Its coming is an event reported in newspapers and told eagerly at the
breakfast table. And as the number of migrants grows and the first mists of green appear in the
woodlands, thousands of people listen for the first dawn chorus of the robins throbbing in the
early morning light. But now all is changed, and not even the return of the birds may be taken
for granted. The survival of the robin, and indeed of many other species as well, seems fatefully
linked with the American elm, a tree that is part of the history of thousands of towns from the
Atlantic to the Rockies, gracing their streets and their village squares and college campuses with
majestic archways of green. Now the elms are stricken with a disease that afflicts them
throughout their range, a disease so serious that many experts believe all efforts to save the
elms will in the end be futile. It would be tragic to lose the elms, but it would be doubly tragic if,
in vain efforts to save them, we plunge vast segments of our bird populations into the night of
extinction. Yet this is precisely what is threatened. The so-called Dutch elm disease entered the
United States from Europe about 1930 in elm burl logs imported for the veneer industry. It is a
fungus disease; the organism invades the water-conducting vessels of the tree, spreads by
spores carried by the flow of sap, and by its poisonous secretions as well as by mechanical
clogging causes the branches to wilt and the tree to die. The disease is spread from diseased to
healthy trees by elm bark beetles. The galleries which the insects have tunneled out under the
bark of dead trees become contaminated with spores of the invading fungus, and the spores
adhere to the insect body and are carried wherever the beetle flies. Efforts to control the
fungus disease of the elms have been directed largely toward control of the carrier insect. In
community after community, especially throughout the strongholds of the American elm, the
Midwest and New England, intensive spraying has become a routine procedure.
What this spraying could mean to bird life, and especially to the robin, was first made clear by
the work of two ornithologists at Michigan State University, Professor George Wallace and one
of his graduate students, John Mehner. When Mr. Mehner began work for the doctorate in
1954, he chose a research project that had to do with robin populations. This was quite by
chance, for at that time no one suspected that the robins were in danger. But even as he
undertook the work, events occurred that were to change its character and indeed to deprive
him of his material. Spraying for Dutch elm disease began in a small way on the university
campus in 1954. The following year the city of East Lansing (where the university is located)
joined in, spraying on the campus was expanded, and, with local programs for gypsy moth and
mosquito control also under way, the rain of chemicals increased to a downpour. During 1954,
the year of the first light spraying, all seemed well. The following spring the migrating robins
began to return to the campus as usual. Like the bluebells in Tomlinson’s haunting essay ‘The
Lost Wood’, they were ‘expecting no evil’ as they reoccupied their familiar territories. But soon
it became evident that something was wrong. Dead and dying robins began to appear in the
campus. Few birds were seen in their normal foraging activities or assembling in their usual
roosts. Few nests were built; few young appeared. The pattern was repeated with monotonous
regularity in succeeding springs. The sprayed area had become a lethal trap in which each wave
of migrating robins would be eliminated in about a week. Then new arrivals would come in,
only to add to the numbers of doomed birds seen on the campus in the agonized tremors that
precede death. ‘The campus is serving as a graveyard for most of the robins that attempt to
take up residence in the spring,’ said Dr. Wallace. But why? At first he suspected some disease

of the nervous system, but soon it became evident that ‘in spite of the assurances of the
insecticide people that their sprays were “harmless to birds” the robins were really dying of
insecticidal poisoning; they exhibited the well-known symptoms of loss of balance, followed by
tremors, convulsions, and death.’
Several facts suggested that the robins were being poisoned, not so much by direct contact
with the insecticides as indirectly, by eating earthworms. Campus earthworms had been fed
inadvertently to crayfish in a research project and all the crayfish had promptly died. A snake
kept in a laboratory cage had gone into violent tremors after being fed such worms. And
earthworms are the principal food of robins in the spring. A key piece in the jigsaw puzzle of the
doomed robins was soon to be supplied by Dr. Roy Barker of the Illinois Natural History Survey
at Urbana. Dr. Barker’s work, published in 1958, traced the intricate cycle of events by which
the robins’ fate is linked to the elm trees by way of the earthworms. The trees are sprayed in
the spring (usually at the rate of 2 to 5 pounds of DDT per 50-foot tree, which may be the
equivalent of as much as 23 pounds per acre where elms are numerous) and often again in July,
at about half this concentration. Powerful sprayers direct a stream of poison to all parts of the
tallest trees, killing directly not only the target organism, the bark beetle, but other insects,
including pollinating species and predatory spiders and beetles. The poison forms a tenacious
film over the leaves and bark. Rains do not wash it away. In the autumn the leaves fall to the
ground, accumulate in sodden layers, and begin the slow process of becoming one with the soil.
In this they are aided by the toil of the earthworms, who feed in the leaf litter, for elm leaves
are among their favorite foods. In feeding on the leaves the worms also swallow the insecticide,
accumulating and concentrating it in their bodies. Dr. Barker found deposits of DDT throughout
the digestive tracts of the worms, their blood vessels, nerves, and body wall. Undoubtedly
some of the earthworms themselves succumb, but others survive to become ‘biological
magnifiers’ of the poison. In the spring the robins return to provide another link in the cycle. As
few as 11 large earthworms can transfer a lethal dose of DDT to a robin. And 11 worms form a
small part of a day’s rations to a bird that eats 10 to 12 earthworms in as many minutes.
Not all robins receive a lethal dose, but another consequence may lead to the extinction of
their kind as surely as fatal poisoning. The shadow of sterility lies over all the bird studies and
indeed lengthens to include all living things within its potential range. There are now only two
or three dozen robins to be found each spring on the entire 185-acre campus of Michigan State
University, compared with a conservatively estimated 370 adults in this area before spraying. In
1954 every robin nest under observation by Mehner produced young. Toward the end of June,
1957, when at least 370 young birds (the normal replacement of the adult population) would
have been foraging over the campus in the years before spraying began, Mehner could find only
one young robin. A year later Dr. Wallace was to report: ‘At no time during the spring or
summer [of 1958] did I see a fledgling robin anywhere on the main campus, and so far I have
failed to find anyone else who has seen one there.’
Part of this failure to produce young is due, of course, to the fact that one or more of a pair of
robins dies before the nesting cycle is completed. But Wallace has significant records which
point to something more sinister—the actual destruction of the birds’ capacity to reproduce.
He has, for example, ‘records of robins and other birds building nests but laying no eggs, and
others laying eggs and incubating them but not hatching them. We have one record of a robin
that sat on its eggs faithfully for 21 days and they did not hatch. The normal incubation period

is 13 days...Our analyses are showing high concentrations of DDT in the testes and ovaries of
breeding birds,’ he told a congressional committee in 1960. ‘Ten males had amounts ranging
from 30 to 109 parts per million in the testes, and two females had 151 and 211 parts per
million respectively in the egg follicles in their ovaries.’ Soon studies in other areas began to
develop findings equally dismal. Professor Joseph Hickey and his students at the University of
Wisconsin, after careful comparative studies of sprayed and unsprayed areas, reported the
robin mortality to be at least 86 to 88 per cent. The Cranbrook Institute of Science at Bloomfield
Hills, Michigan, in an effort to assess the extent of bird loss caused by the spraying of the elms,
asked in 1956 that all birds thought to be victims of DDT poisoning be turned in to the institute
for examination. The request had a response beyond all expectations. Within a few weeks the
deep-freeze facilities of the institute were taxed to capacity, so that other specimens had to be
refused. By 1959 a thousand poisoned birds from this single community had been turned in or
reported. Although the robin was the chief victim (one woman calling the institute reported 12
robins lying dead on her lawn as she spoke), 63 different species were included among the
specimens examined at the institute. The robins, then, are only one part of the chain of
devastation linked to the spraying of the elms, even as the elm program is only one of the
multitudinous spray programs that cover our land with poisons. Heavy mortality has occurred
among about 90 species of birds, including those most familiar to suburbanites and amateur
naturalists. The populations of nesting birds in general have declined as much as 90 per cent in
some of the sprayed towns. As we shall see, all the various types of birds are affected—ground
feeders, treetop feeders, bark feeders, predators. It is only reasonable to suppose that all birds
and mammals heavily dependent on earthworms or other soil organisms for food are
threatened by the robins’ fate. Some 45 species of birds include earthworms in their diet.
Among them is the woodcock, a species that winters in southern areas recently heavily sprayed
with heptachlor. Two significant discoveries have now been made about the woodcock.
Production of young birds on the New Brunswick breeding grounds is definitely reduced, and
adult birds that have been analyzed contain large residues of DDT and heptachlor. Already
there are disturbing records of heavy mortality among more than 20 other species of groundfeeding birds whose food—worms, ants, grubs, or other soil organisms—has been poisoned.
These include three of the thrushes whose songs are among the most exquisite of bird voices,
the olive-backed, the wood, and the hermit. And the sparrows that flit through the shrubby
understory of the woodlands and forage with rustling sounds amid the fallen leaves—the song
sparrow and the white-throat—these, too, have been found among the victims of the elm
sprays. Mammals, also, may easily be involved in the cycle, directly or indirectly. Earthworms
are important among the various foods of the raccoon, and are eaten in the spring and fall by
opossums. Such subterranean tunnelers as shrews and moles capture them in numbers, and
then perhaps pass on the poison to predators such as screech owls and barn owls.
Several dying screech owls were picked up in Wisconsin following heavy rains in spring, perhaps
poisoned by feeding on earthworms. Hawks and owls have been found in convulsions—great
horned owls, screech owls, red-shouldered hawks, sparrow hawks, marsh hawks. These may be
cases of secondary poisoning, caused by eating birds or mice that have accumulated
insecticides in their livers or other organs. Nor is it only the creatures that forage on the ground
or those who prey on them that are endangered by the foliar spraying of the elms. All of the
treetop feeders, the birds that glean their insect food from the leaves, have disappeared from

heavily sprayed areas, among them those woodland sprites the kinglets, both ruby-crowned
and golden-crowned, the tiny gnatcatchers, and many of the warblers, whose migrating hordes
flow through the trees in spring in a multicolored tide of life. In 1956, a late spring delayed
spraying so that it coincided with the arrival of an exceptionally heavy wave of warbler
migration. Nearly all species of warblers present in the area were represented in the heavy kill
that followed. In Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin, at least a thousand myrtle warblers could be seen in
migration during former years; in 1958, after the spraying of the elms, observers could find only
two. So, with additions from other communities, the list grows, and the warblers killed by the
spray include those that most charm and fascinate all who are aware of them: the black-andwhite, the yellow, the magnolia, and the Cape May; the ovenbird, whose call throbs in the
Maytime woods; the Blackburnian, whose wings are touched with flame; the chestnut-sided,
the Canadian, and the black-throated green. These treetop feeders are affected either directly
by eating poisoned insects or indirectly by a shortage of food.
The loss of food has also struck hard at the swallows that cruise the skies, straining out the
aerial insects as herring strain the plankton of the sea. A Wisconsin naturalist reported:
‘Swallows have been hard hit. Everyone complains of how few they have compared to four or
five years ago. Our sky overhead was full of them only four years ago. Now we seldom see
any...This could be both lack of insects because of spray, or poisoned insects.’ Of other birds
this same observer wrote: ‘Another striking loss is the phoebe. Flycatchers are scarce
everywhere but the early hardy common phoebe is no more. I’ve seen one this spring and only
one last spring. Other birders in Wisconsin make the same complaint. I have had five or six pair
of cardinals in the past, none now. Wrens, robins, catbirds and screech owls have nested each
year in our garden. There are none now. Summer mornings are without bird song. Only pest
birds, pigeons, starlings and English sparrows remain. It is tragic and I can’t bear it.’
The dormant sprays applied to the elms in the fall, sending the poison into every little crevice in
the bark, are probably responsible for the severe reduction observed in the number of
chickadees, nuthatches, titmice, woodpeckers, and brown creepers. During the winter of 195758, Dr. Wallace saw no chickadees or nuthatches at his home feeding station for the first time
in many years. Three nuthatches he found later provided a sorry little step-by-step lesson in
cause and effect: one was feeding on an elm, another was found dying of typical DDT
symptoms, the third was dead. The dying nuthatch was later found to have 226 parts per
million of DDT in its tissues. The feeding habits of all these birds not only make them especially
vulnerable to insect sprays but also make their loss a deplorable one for economic as well as
less tangible reasons. The summer food of the white-breasted nuthatch and the brown creeper,
for example, includes the eggs, larvae, and adults of a very large number of insects injurious to
trees. About three quarters of the food of the chickadee is animal, including all stages of the life
cycle of many insects. The chickadee’s method of feeding is described in Bent’s monumental
Life Histories of North American birds: ‘As the flock moves along each bird examines minutely
bark, twigs, and branches, searching for tiny bits of food (spiders’ eggs, cocoons, or other
dormant insect life).’ Various scientific studies have established the critical role of birds in insect
control in various situations. Thus, woodpeckers are the primary control of the Engelmann
spruce beetle, reducing its populations from 45 to 98 per cent and are important in the control
of the codling moth in apple orchards. Chickadees and other winter-resident birds can protect
orchards against the cankerworm.

But what happens in nature is not allowed to happen in the modern, chemical-drenched world,
where spraying destroys not only the insects but their principal enemy, the birds. When later
there is a resurgence of the insect population, as almost always happens, the birds are not
there to keep their numbers in check. As the Curator of Birds at the Milwaukee Public Museum,
Owen J. Gromme, wrote to the Milwaukee Journal: ‘The greatest enemy of insect life is other
predatory insects, birds, and some small mammals, but DDT kills indiscriminately, including
nature’s own safeguards or policemen... In the name of progress are we to become victims of
our own diabolical means of insect control to provide temporary comfort, only to lose out to
destroying insects later on? By what means will we control new pests, which will attack
remaining tree species after the elms are gone, when nature’s safeguards (the birds) have been
wiped out by poison?’
Mr. Gromme reported that calls and letters about dead and dying birds had been increasing
steadily during the years since spraying began in Wisconsin. Questioning always revealed that
spraying or fogging had been done in the area where the birds were dying.
Mr. Gromme’s experience has been shared by ornithologists and conservationists at most of
the research centers of the Midwest such as the Cranbrook Institute in Michigan, the Illinois
Natural History Survey, and the University of Wisconsin. A glance at the Letters-from-Readers
column of newspapers almost anywhere that spraying is being done makes clear the fact that
citizens are not only becoming aroused and indignant but that often they show a keener
understanding of the dangers and inconsistencies of spraying than do the officials who order it
done. ‘I am dreading the days to come soon now when many beautiful birds will be dying in our
back yard,’ wrote a Milwaukee woman. ‘This is a pitiful, heartbreaking experience... It is,
moreover, frustrating and exasperating, for it evidently does not serve the purpose this
slaughter was intended to serve... Taking a long look, can you save trees without also saving
birds? Do they not, in the economy of nature, save each other? Isn’t it possible to help the
balance of nature without destroying it?’ The idea that the elms, majestic shade trees though
they are, are not ‘sacred cows’ and do not justify an ‘open end’ campaign of destruction against
all other forms of life is expressed in other letters. ‘I have always loved our elm trees which
seemed like trademarks on our landscape,’ wrote another Wisconsin woman. ‘But there are
many kinds of trees...We must save our birds, too. Can anyone imagine anything so cheerless
and dreary as a springtime without a robin’s song?’ To the public the choice may easily appear
to be one of stark black-or-white simplicity: Shall we have birds or shall we have elms? But it is
not as simple as that, and by one of the ironies that abound throughout the field of chemical
control we may very well end by having neither if we continue on our present, well-traveled
road. Spraying is killing the birds but it is not saving the elms. The illusion that salvation of the
elms lies at the end of a spray nozzle is a dangerous will-o’- the-wisp that is leading one
community after another into a morass of heavy expenditures, without producing lasting
results. Greenwich, Connecticut sprayed regularly for ten years. Then a drought year brought
conditions especially favorable to the beetle and the mortality of elms went up 1000 per cent.
In Urbana, Illinois, where the University of Illinois is located, Dutch elm disease first appeared in
1951. Spraying was undertaken in 1953. By 1959, in spite of six years’ spraying, the university
campus had lost 86 per cent of its elms, half of them victims of Dutch elm disease. In Toledo,
Ohio, a similar experience caused the Superintendent of Forestry, Joseph A. Sweeney, to take a
realistic look at the results of spraying. Spraying was begun there in 1953 and continued

through 1959. Meanwhile, however, Mr. Sweeney had noticed that a city-wide infestation of
the cottony maple scale was worse after the spraying recommended by ‘the books and the
authorities’ than it had been before. He decided to review the results of spraying for Dutch elm
disease for himself. His findings shocked him. In the city of Toledo, he found, ‘the only areas
under any control were the areas where we used some promptness in removing the diseased or
brood trees. Where we depended on spraying the disease was out of control. In the country
where nothing has been done the disease has not spread as fast as it has in the city. This
indicates that spraying destroys any natural enemies. ‘We are abandoning spraying for the
Dutch elm disease. This has brought me into conflict with the people who back any
recommendations by the United States Department of Agriculture but I have the facts and will
stick with them.’ It is difficult to understand why these midwestern towns, to which the elm
disease spread only rather recently, have so unquestioningly embarked on ambitious and
expensive spraying programs, apparently without waiting to inquire into the experience of
other areas that have had longer acquaintance with the problem. New York State, for example,
has certainly had the longest history of continuous experience with Dutch elm disease, for it
was via the Port of New York that diseased elm wood is thought to have entered the United
States about 1930. And New York State today has a most impressive record of containing and
suppressing the disease. Yet it has not relied upon spraying. In fact, its agricultural extension
service does not recommend spraying as a community method of control.
How, then, has New York achieved its fine record? From the early years of the battle for the
elms to the present time, it has relied upon rigorous sanitation, or the prompt removal and
destruction of all diseased or infected wood. In the beginning some of the results were
disappointing, but this was because it was not at first understood that not only diseased trees
but all elm wood in which the beetles might breed must be destroyed. Infected elm wood, after
being cut and stored for firewood, will release a crop of fungus-carrying beetles unless burned
before spring. It is the adult beetles, emerging from hibernation to feed in late April and May,
that transmit Dutch elm disease. New York entomologists have learned by experience what
kinds of beetle-breeding material have real importance in the spread of the disease. By
concentrating on this dangerous material, it has been possible not only to get good results, but
to keep the cost of the sanitation program within reasonable limits. By 1950 the incidence of
Dutch elm disease in New York City had been reduced to of 1 per cent of the city’s 55,000 elms.
A sanitation program was launched in Westchester County in 1942.
During the next 14 years the average annual loss of elms was only of 1 per cent a year. Buffalo,
with 185,000 elms, has an excellent record of containing the disease by sanitation, with recent
annual losses amounting to only of 1 per cent. In other words, at this rate of loss it would take
about 300 years to eliminate Buffalo’s elms. What has happened in Syracuse is especially
impressive. There no effective program was in operation before 1957. Between 1951 and 1956
Syracuse lost nearly 3000 elms. Then, under the direction of Howard C. Miller of the New York
State University College of Forestry, an intensive drive was made to remove all diseased elm
trees and all possible sources of beetle-breeding elm wood. The rate of loss is now well below 1
per cent a year. The economy of the sanitation method is stressed by New York experts in
Dutch elm disease control. ‘In most cases the actual expense is small compared with the
probable saving,’ says J. G. Matthysse of the New York State College of Agriculture. ‘If it is a
case of a dead or broken limb, the limb would have to be removed eventually, as a precaution

against possible property damage or personal injury. If it is a fuel-wood pile, the wood can be
used before spring, the bark can be peeled from the wood, or the wood can be stored in a dry
place. In the case of dying or dead elm trees, the expense of prompt removal to prevent Dutch
elm disease spread is usually no greater than would be necessary later, for most dead trees in
urban regions must be removed eventually.’ The situation with regard to Dutch elm disease is
therefore not entirely hopeless provided informed and intelligent measures are taken. While it
cannot be eradicated by any means now known, once it has become established in a
community, it can be suppressed and contained within reasonable bounds by sanitation, and
without the use of methods that are not only futile but involve tragic destruction of bird life.
Other possibilities lie within the field of forest genetics, where experiments offer hope of
developing a hybrid elm resistant to Dutch elm disease. The European elm is highly resistant,
and many of them have been planted in Washington, D.C. Even during a period when a high
percentage of the city’s elms were affected, no cases of Dutch elm disease were found among
these trees. Replanting through an immediate tree nursery and forestry program is being urged
in communities that are losing large numbers of elms. This is important, and although such
programs might well include the resistant European elms, they should aim at a variety of
species so that no future epidemic could deprive a community of its trees. The key to a healthy
plant or animal community lies in what the British ecologist Charles Elton calls ‘the conservation
of variety’. What is happening now is in large part a result of the biological unsophistication of
past generations. Even a generation ago no one knew that to fill large areas with a single
species of tree was to invite disaster. And so whole towns lined their streets and dotted their
parks with elms, and today the elms die and so do the birds. . . .
Like the robin, another American bird seems to be on the verge of extinction. This is the
national symbol, the eagle. Its populations have dwindled alarmingly within the past decade.
The facts suggest that something is at work in the eagle’s environment which has virtually
destroyed its ability to reproduce. What this may be is not yet definitely known, but there is
some evidence that insecticides are responsible.
The most intensively studied eagles in North America have been those nesting along a stretch
of coast from Tampa to Fort Myers on the western coast of Florida. There a retired banker from
Winnipeg, Charles Broley, achieved ornithological fame by banding more than 1,000 young bald
eagles during the years 1939-49. (Only 166 eagles had been banded in all the earlier history of
birdbanding.) Mr. Broley banded eagles as young birds during the winter months before they
had left their nests. Later recoveries of banded birds showed that these Florida-born eagles
range northward along the coast into Canada as far as Prince Edward Island, although they had
previously been considered nonmigratory. In the fall they return to the South, their migration
being observed at such famous vantage points as Hawk Mountain in eastern Pennsylvania.
During the early years of his banding, Mr. Broley used to find 125 active nests a year on the
stretch of coast he had chosen for his work. The number of young banded each year was about
150. In 1947 the production of young birds began to decline. Some nests contained no eggs;
others contained eggs that failed to hatch. Between 1952 and 1957, about 80 per cent of the
nests failed to produce young. In the last year of this period only 43 nests were occupied. Seven
of them produced young (8 eaglets); 23 contained eggs that failed to hatch; 13 were used
merely as feeding stations by adult eagles and contained no eggs. In 1958 Mr. Broley ranged
over 100 miles of coast before finding and banding one eaglet. Adult eagles, which had been

seen at 43 nests in 1957, were so scarce that he observed them at only 10 nests. Although Mr.
Broley’s death in 1959 terminated this valuable series of uninterrupted observations, reports by
the Florida Audubon Society, as well as from New Jersey and Pennsylvania, confirm the trend
that may well make it necessary for us to find a new national emblem. The reports of Maurice
Broun, curator of the Hawk Mountain Sanctuary, are especially significant. Hawk Mountain is a
picturesque mountaintop in southeastern Pennsylvania, where the easternmost ridges of the
Appalachians form a last barrier to the westerly winds before dropping away toward the coastal
plain. Winds striking the mountains are deflected upward so that on many autumn days there is
a continuous updraft on which the broad-winged hawks and eagles ride without effort, covering
many miles of their southward migration in a day. At Hawk Mountain the ridges converge and
so do the aerial highways. The result is that from a widespread territory to the north birds pass
through this traffic bottleneck. In his more than a score of years as custodian of the sanctuary
there, Maurice Broun has observed and actually tabulated more hawks and eagles than any
other American. The peak of the bald eagle migration comes in late August and early
September. These are assumed to be Florida birds, returning to home territory after a summer
in the North. (Later in the fall and early winter a few larger eagles drift through. These are
thought to belong to a northern race, bound for an unknown wintering ground.) During the first
years after the sanctuary was established, from 1935 to 1939, 40 per cent of the eagles
observed were yearlings, easily identified by their uniformly dark plumage. But in recent years
these immature birds have become a rarity. Between 1955 and 1959, they made up only 20 per
cent of the total count, and in one year (1957) there was only one young eagle for every 32
adults. Observations at Hawk Mountain are in line with findings elsewhere. One such report
comes from Elton Fawks, an official of the Natural Resources Council of Illinois. Eagles—
probably northern nesters—winter along the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers. In 1958 Mr. Fawks
reported that a recent count of 59 eagles had included only one immature bird. Similar
indications of the dying out of the race come from the world’s only sanctuary for eagles alone,
Mount Johnson Island in the Susquehanna River. The island, although only 8 miles above
Conowingo Dam and about half a mile out from the Lancaster County shore, retains its
primitive wildness. Since 1934 its single eagle nest has been under observation by Professor
Herbert H. Beck, an ornithologist of Lancaster and custodian of the sanctuary. Between 1935
and 1947 use of the nest was regular and uniformly successful. Since 1947, although the adults
have occupied the nest and there is evidence of egg laying, no young eagles have been
produced. On Mount Johnson Island as well as in Florida, then, the same situation prevails—
there is some occupancy of nests by adults, some production of eggs, but few or no young
birds. In seeking an explanation, only one appears to fit all the facts. This is that the
reproductive capacity of the birds has been so lowered by some environmental agent that
there are now almost no annual additions of young to maintain the race.
Exactly this sort of situation has been produced artificially in other birds by various
experimenters, notably Dr. James DeWitt of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Dr.
DeWitt’s now classic experiments on the effect of a series of insecticides on quail and
pheasants have established the fact that exposure to DDT or related chemicals, even when
doing no observable harm to the parent birds, may seriously affect reproduction. The way the
effect is exerted may vary, but the end result is always the same. For example, quail into whose
diet DDT was introduced throughout the breeding season survived and even produced normal

numbers of fertile eggs. But few of the eggs hatched. ‘Many embryos appeared to develop
normally during the early stages of incubation, but died during the hatching period,’ Dr. DeWitt
said. Of those that did hatch, more than half died within 5 days. In other tests in which both
pheasants and quail were the subjects, the adults produced no eggs whatever if they had been
fed insecticide-contaminated diets throughout the year. And at the University of California, Dr.
Robert Rudd and Dr. Richard Genelly reported similar findings. When pheasants received
dieldrin in their diets, ‘egg production was markedly lowered and chick survival was poor.’
According to these authors, the delayed but lethal effect on the young birds follows from
storage of dieldrin in the yolk of the egg, from which it is gradually assimilated during
incubation and after hatching. This suggestion is strongly supported by recent studies by Dr.
Wallace and a graduate student, Richard F. Bernard, who found high concentrations of DDT in
robins on the Michigan State University campus. They found the poison in all of the testes of
male robins examined, in developing egg follicles, in the ovaries of females, in completed but
unlaid eggs, in the oviducts, in unhatched eggs from deserted nests, in embryos within the eggs,
and in a newly hatched, dead nestling. These important studies establish the fact that the
insecticidal poison affects a generation once removed from initial contact with it. Storage of
poison in the egg, in the yolk material that nourishes the developing embryo, is a virtual death
warrant and explains why so many of DeWitt’s birds died in the egg or a few days after
hatching.
Laboratory application of these studies to eagles presents difficulties that are nearly
insuperable, but field studies are now under way in Florida, New Jersey, and elsewhere in the
hope of acquiring definite evidence as to what has caused the apparent sterility of much of the
eagle population. Meanwhile, the available circumstantial evidence points to insecticides. In
localities where fish are abundant they make up a large part of the eagle’s diet (about 65 per
cent in Alaska; about 52 per cent in the Chesapeake Bay area). Almost unquestionably the
eagles so long studied by Mr. Broley were predominantly fish eaters. Since 1945 this particular
coastal area has been subjected to repeated sprayings with DDT dissolved in fuel oil. The
principal target of the aerial spraying was the salt-marsh mosquito, which inhabits the marshes
and coastal areas that are typical foraging areas for the eagles. Fishes and crabs were killed in
enormous numbers. Laboratory analyses of their tissues revealed high concentrations of DDT—
as much as 46 parts per million. Like the grebes of Clear Lake, which accumulated heavy
concentrations of insecticide residues from eating the fish of the lake, the eagles have almost
certainly been storing up the DDT in the tissues of their bodies. And like the grebes, the
pheasants, the quail, and the robins, they are less and less able to produce young and to
preserve the continuity of their race. . . .
From all over the world come echoes of the peril that faces birds in our modern world. The
reports differ in detail, but always repeat the theme of death to wildlife in the wake of
pesticides. Such are the stories of hundreds of small birds and partridges dying in France after
vine stumps were treated with an arsenic-containing herbicide, or of partridge shoots in
Belgium, once famous for the numbers of their birds, denuded of partridges after the spraying
of nearby farmlands. In England the major problem seems to be a specialized one, linked with
the growing practice of treating seed with insecticides before sowing. Seed treatment is not a
wholly new thing, but in earlier years the chemicals principally used were fungicides. No effects
on birds seem to have been noticed. Then about 1956 there was a change to dual-purpose

treatment; in addition to a fungicide, dieldrin, aldrin, or heptachlor was added to combat soil
insects. Thereupon the situation changed for the worse.
In the spring of 1960 a deluge of reports of dead birds reached British wildlife authorities,
including the British Trust for Ornithology, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, and the
Game Birds Association. ‘The place is like a battlefield,’ a landowner in Norfolk wrote. ‘My
keeper has found innumerable corpses, including masses of small birds— Chaffinches,
Greenfinches, Linnets, Hedge Sparrows, also House Sparrows...the destruction of wild life is
quite pitiful.’ A gamekeeper wrote: ‘My Partridges have been wiped out with the dressed corn,
also some Pheasants and all other birds, hundreds of birds have been killed... As a lifelong
gamekeeper it has been a distressing experience for me. It is bad to see pairs of Partridges that
have died together.’ In a joint report, the British Trust for Ornithology and the Royal Society for
the Protection of Birds described some 67 kills of birds—a far from complete listing of the
destruction that took place in the spring of 1960. Of these 67, 59 were caused by seed
dressings, 8 by toxic sprays. A new wave of poisoning set in the following year. The death of 600
birds on a single estate in Norfolk was reported to the House of Lords, and 100 pheasants died
on a farm in North Essex. It soon became evident that more counties were involved than in
1960 (34 compared with 23). Lincolnshire, heavily agricultural, seemed to have suffered most,
with reports of 10,000 birds dead. But destruction involved all of agricultural England, from
Angus in the north to Cornwall in the south, from Anglesey in the west to Norfolk in the east.
In the spring of 1961 concern reached such a peak that a special committee of the House of
Commons made an investigation of the matter, taking testimony from farmers, landowners,
and representatives of the Ministry of Agriculture and of various governmental and nongovernmental agencies concerned with wildlife. ‘Pigeons are suddenly dropping out of the sky
dead,’ said one witness. ‘You can drive a hundred or two hundred miles outside London and not
see a single kestrel,’ reported another. ‘There has been no parallel in the present century, or at
any time so far as I am aware, [this is] the biggest risk to wildlife and game that ever occurred in
the country,’ officials of the Nature Conservancy testified.
Facilities for chemical analysis of the victims were most inadequate to the task, with only two
chemists in the country able to make the tests (one the government chemist, the other in the
employ of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds). Witnesses described huge bonfires on
which the bodies of the birds were burned. But efforts were made to have carcasses collected
for examination, and of the birds analyzed, all but one contained pesticide residues. The single
exception was a snipe, which is not a seed-eating bird. Along with the birds, foxes also may
have been affected, probably indirectly by eating poisoned mice or birds. England, plagued by
rabbits, sorely needs the fox as a predator. But between November 1959 and April 1960 at least
1300 foxes died. Deaths were heaviest in the same counties from which sparrow hawks,
kestrels, and other birds of prey virtually disappeared, suggesting that the poison was spreading
through the food chain, reaching out from the seed eaters to the furred and feathered
carnivores. The actions of the moribund foxes were those of animals poisoned by chlorinated
hydrocarbon insecticides. They were seen wandering in circles, dazed and half blind, before
dying in convulsions.
The hearings convinced the committee that the threat to wildlife was ‘most alarming’; it
accordingly recommended to the House of Commons that ‘the Minister of Agriculture and the
Secretary of State for Scotland should secure the immediate prohibition for the use as seed

dressings of compounds containing dieldrin, aldrin, or heptachlor, or chemicals of comparable
toxicity.’ The committee also recommended more adequate controls to ensure that chemicals
were adequately tested under field as well as laboratory conditions before being put on the
market. This, it is worth emphasizing, is one of the great blank spots in pesticide research
everywhere. Manufacturers’ tests on the common laboratory animals—rats, dogs, guinea
pigs—include no wild species, no birds as a rule, no fishes, and are conducted under controlled
and artificial conditions. Their application to wildlife in the field is anything but precise. England
is by no means alone in its problem of protecting birds from treated seeds. Here in the United
States the problem has been most troublesome in the rice-growing areas of California and the
South. For a number of years California rice growers have been treating seed with DDT as
protection against tadpole shrimp and scavenger beetles which sometimes damage seedling
rice. California sportsmen have enjoyed excellent hunting because of the concentrations of
waterfowl and pheasants in the rice fields. But for the past decade persistent reports of bird
losses, especially among pheasants, ducks, and blackbirds, have come from the rice-growing
counties. ‘Pheasant sickness’ became a well-known phenomenon: birds ‘seek water, become
paralyzed, and are found on the ditch banks and rice checks quivering,’ according to one
observer. The ‘sickness’ comes in the spring, at the time the rice fields are seeded. The
concentration of DDT used is many times the amount that will kill an adult pheasant.
The passage of a few years and the development of even more poisonous insecticides served to
increase the hazard from treated seed. Aldrin, which is 100 times as toxic as DDT to pheasants,
is now widely used as a seed coating. In the rice fields of eastern Texas, this practice has
seriously reduced the populations of the famous tree duck, a tawny-colored, gooselike duck of
the Gulf Coast. Indeed, there is some reason to think that the rice growers, having found a way
to reduce the populations of blackbirds, are using the insecticide for a dual purpose, with
disastrous effects on several bird species of the rice fields. As the habit of killing grows—the
resort to ‘eradicating’ any creature that may annoy or inconvenience us—birds are more and
more finding themselves a direct target of poisons rather than an incidental one. There is a
growing trend toward aerial applications of such deadly poisons as parathion to ‘control’
concentrations of birds distasteful to farmers. The Fish and Wildlife Service has found it
necessary to express serious concern over this trend, pointing out that ‘parathion treated areas
constitute a potential hazard to humans, domestic animals, and wildlife.’ In southern Indiana,
for example, a group of farmers went together in the summer of 1959 to engage a spray plane
to treat an area of river bottomland with parathion. The area was a favored roosting site for
thousands of blackbirds that were feeding in nearby corn fields. The problem could have been
solved easily by a slight change in agricultural practice shift to a variety of corn with deep-set
ears not accessible to the birds—but the farmers had been persuaded of the merits of killing by
poison, and so they sent in the planes on their mission of death.
The results probably gratified the farmers, for the casualty list included some 65,000 redwinged blackbirds and starlings. What other wildlife deaths may have gone unnoticed and
unrecorded is not known. Parathion is not a specific for blackbirds: it is a universal killer. But
such rabbits or raccoons or opossums as may have roamed those bottomlands and perhaps
never visited the farmers’ cornfields were doomed by a judge and jury who neither knew of
their existence nor cared. And what of human beings? In California orchards sprayed with this

same parathion, workers handling foliage that had been treated a month earlier collapsed and
went into shock, and escaped death only through skilled medical attention.
Does Indiana still raise any boys who roam through woods or fields and might even explore the
margins of a river? If so, who guarded the poisoned area to keep out any who might wander in,
in misguided search for unspoiled nature? Who kept vigilant watch to tell the innocent stroller
that the fields he was about to enter were deadly—all their vegetation coated with a lethal
film? Yet at so fearful a risk the farmers, with none to hinder them, waged their needless war
on blackbirds. In each of these situations, one turns away to ponder the question: Who has
made the decision that sets in motion these chains of poisonings, this ever-widening wave of
death that spreads out, like ripples when a pebble is dropped into a still pond? Who has placed
in one pan of the scales the leaves that might have been eaten by the beetles and in the other
the pitiful heaps of many-hued feathers, the lifeless remains of the birds that fell before the
unselective bludgeon of insecticidal poisons? Who has decided —who has the right to decide—
for the countless legions of people who were not consulted that the supreme value is a world
without insects, even though it be also a sterile world ungraced by the curving wing of a bird in
flight? The decision is that of the authoritarian temporarily entrusted with power; he has made
it during a moment of inattention by millions to whom beauty and the ordered world of nature
still have a meaning that is deep and imperative.

9. Rivers of Death
FROM THE GREEN DEPTHS of the offshore Atlantic many paths lead back to the coast.
They are paths followed by fish; although unseen and intangible, they are linked with the
outflow of waters from the coastal rivers. For thousands upon thousands of years the salmon
have known and followed these threads of fresh water that lead them back to the rivers, each
returning to the tributary in which it spent the first months or years of life. So, in the summer
and fall of 1953, the salmon of the river called Miramichi on the coast of New Brunswick moved
in from their feeding grounds in the far Atlantic and ascended their native river. In the upper
reaches of the Miramichi, in streams that gather together a network of shadowed brooks, the
salmon deposited their eggs that autumn in beds of gravel over which the stream water flowed
swift and cold. Such places, the watersheds of the great coniferous forests of spruce and
balsam, of hemlock and pine, provide the kind of spawning grounds that salmon must have in
order to survive.
These events repeated a pattern that was age-old, a pattern that had made the Miramichi one
of the finest salmon streams in North America. But that year the pattern was to be broken.
During the fall and winter the salmon eggs, large and thickshelled, lay in shallow gravel-filled
troughs, or redds, which the mother fish had dug in the stream bottom. In the cold of winter
they developed slowly, as was their way, and only when spring at last brought thawing and
release to the forest streams did the young hatch. At first they hid among the pebbles of the
stream bed—tiny fish about half an inch long. They took no food, living in the large yolk sac. Not
until it was absorbed would they begin to search the stream for small insects.
With the newly hatched salmon in the Miramichi that spring of 1954 were young of previous
hatchings, salmon a year or two old, young fish in brilliant coats marked with bars and bright
red spots. These young fed voraciously, seeking out the strange and varied insect life of the
stream. As the summer approached, all this was changed. That year the watershed of the
Northwest Miramichi was included in a vast spraying program which the Canadian Government
had embarked upon the previous year—a program designed to save the forests from the spruce
budworm. The budworm is a native insect that attacks several kinds of evergreens. In eastern
Canada it seems to become extraordinarily abundant about every 35 years. The early 1950s had
seen such an upsurge in the budworm populations. To combat it, spraying with DDT was begun,
first in a small way, then at a suddenly accelerated rate in 1953. Millions of acres of forests
were sprayed instead of thousands as before, in an effort to save the balsams, which are the
mainstay of the pulp and paper industry.
So in 1954, in the month of June, the planes visited the forests of the Northwest Miramichi and
white clouds of settling mist marked the crisscross pattern of their flight. The spray—one half
pound of DDT to the acre in a solution of oil— filtered down through the balsam forests and
some of it finally reached the ground and the flowing streams. The pilots, their thoughts only on
their assigned task, made no effort to avoid the streams or to shut off the spray nozzles while
flying over them; but because spray drifts so far in even the slightest stirrings of air, perhaps the
result would have been little different if they had.
Soon after the spraying had ended there were unmistakable signs that all was not well. Within
wo days dead and dying fish, including many young salmon, were found along the banks of the

stream. Brook trout also appeared among the dead fish, and along the roads and in the woods
birds were dying. All the life of the stream was stilled. Before the spraying there had been a rich
assortment of the water life that forms the food of salmon and trout—caddis fly larvae, living in
loosely fitting protective cases of leaves, stems or gravel cemented together with saliva, stone
fly nymphs clinging to rocks in the swirling currents, and the wormlike larvae of blackflies
edging the stones under riffles or where the stream spills over steeply slanting rocks. But now
the stream insects were dead, killed by the DDT, and there was nothing for a young salmon to
eat. Amid such a picture of death and destruction, the young salmon themselves could hardly
have been expected to escape, and they did not. By August not one of the young salmon that
had emerged from the gravel beds that spring remained. A whole year’s spawning had come to
nothing. The older young, those hatched a year or more earlier, fared only slightly better. For
every six young of the 1953 hatch that had foraged in the stream as the planes approached,
only one remained. Young salmon of the 1952 hatch, almost ready to go to sea, lost a third of
their numbers. All these facts are known because the Fisheries Research Board of Canada had
been conducting a salmon study on the Northwest Miramichi since 1950. Each year it had made
a census of the fish living in this stream. The records of the biologists covered the number of
adult salmon ascending to spawn, the number of young of each age group present in the
stream, and the normal population not only of salmon but of other species of fish inhabiting the
stream. With this complete record of prespraying conditions, it was possible to measure the
damage done by the spraying with an accuracy that has seldom been matched elsewhere.
The survey showed more than the loss of young fish; it revealed a serious change in the streams
themselves. Repeated sprayings have now completely altered the stream environment, and the
aquatic insects that are the food of salmon and trout have been killed. A great deal of time is
required, even after a single spraying, for most of these insects to build up sufficient numbers
to support a normal salmon population—time measured in years rather than months. The
smaller species, such as midges and blackflies, become reestablished rather quickly. These are
suitable food for the smallest salmon, the fry only a few months old. But there is no such rapid
recovery of the larger aquatic insects, on which salmon in their second and third years depend.
These are the larval stages of caddis flies, stoneflies, and mayflies. Even in the second year after
DDT enters a stream, a foraging salmon parr would have trouble finding anything more than an
occasional small stonefly. There would be no large stoneflies, no mayflies, no caddis flies. In an
effort to supply this natural food, the Canadians have attempted to transplant caddis fly larvae
and other insects to the barren reaches of the Miramichi. But of course such transplants would
be wiped out by any repeated spraying. The budworm populations, instead of dwindling as
expected, have proved refractory, and from 1955 to 1957 spraying was repeated in various
parts of New Brunswick and Quebec, some places being sprayed as many as three times. By
1957, nearly 15 million acres had been sprayed. Although spraying was then tentatively
suspended, a sudden resurgence of budworms led to its resumption in 1960 and 1961. Indeed
there is no evidence anywhere that chemical spraying for budworm control is more than a
stopgap measure (aimed at saving the trees from death through defoliation over several
successive years), and so its unfortunate side effects will continue to be felt as spraying is
continued. In an effort to minimize the destruction of fish, the Canadian forestry officials have
reduced the concentration of DDT from the ½ pound previously used to ¼ pound to the acre, on

the recommendation of the Fisheries Research Board. (In the United States the standard and
highly lethal pound-to-the-acre still prevails.) Now, after several years in which to observe the
effects of spraying, the Canadians find a mixed situation, but one that affords very little comfort
to devotees of salmon fishing, provided spraying is continued.
A very unusual combination of circumstances has so far saved the runs of the Northwest
Miramichi from the destruction that was anticipated—a constellation of happenings that might
not occur again in a century. It is important to understand what has happened there, and the
reasons for it. In 1954, as we have seen, the watershed of this branch of the Miramichi was
heavily sprayed. Thereafter, except for a narrow band sprayed in 1956, the whole upper
watershed of this branch was excluded from the spraying program. In the fall of 1954 a tropical
storm played its part in the fortunes of the Miramichi salmon. Hurricane Edna, a violent storm
to the very end of its northward path, brought torrential rains to the New England and
Canadian coasts. The resulting freshets carried streams of fresh water far out to sea and drew
in unusual numbers of salmon. As a result, the gravel beds of the streams which the salmon
seek out for spawning received an unusual abundance of eggs. The young salmon hatching in
the Northwest Miramichi in the spring of 1955 found circumstances practically ideal for their
survival. While the DDT had killed off all stream insects the year before, the smallest of the
insects—the midges and blackflies had returned in numbers. These are the normal food of baby
salmon. The salmon fry of that year not only found abundant food but they had few
competitors for it. This was because of the grim fact that the older young salmon had been
killed off by the spraying in 1954. Accordingly, the fry of 1955 grew very fast and survived in
exceptional numbers. They completed their stream growth rapidly and went to sea early. Many
of them returned in 1959 to give large runs of grilse to the native stream.
If the runs in the Northwest Miramichi are still in relatively good condition this is because
spraying was done in one year only. The results of repeated spraying are clearly seen in other
streams of the watershed, where alarming declines in the salmon populations are occurring.
In all sprayed streams, young salmon of every size are scarce. The youngest are often
‘practically wiped out’, the biologists report. In the main Southwest Miramichi, which was
sprayed in 1956 and 1957, the 1959 catch was the lowest in a decade. Fishermen remarked on
the extreme scarcity of grilse—the youngest group of returning fish. At the sampling trap in the
estuary of the Miramichi the count of grilse was only a fourth as large in 1959 as the year
before. In 1959 the whole Miramichi watershed produced only about 600,000 smolt (young
salmon descending to the sea). This was less than a third of the runs of the three preceding
years. Against such a background, the future of the salmon fisheries in New Brunswick may well
depend on finding a substitute for drenching forests with DDT. . . .
The eastern Canadian situation is not unique, except perhaps in the extent of forest spraying
and the wealth of facts that have been collected. Maine, too, has its forests of spruce and
balsam, and its problem of controlling forest insects. Maine, too, has its salmon runs—a
remnant of the magnificent runs of former days, but a remnant hard won by the work of
biologists and conservationists to save some habitat for salmon in streams burdened with
industrial pollution and choked with logs. Although spraying has been tried as a weapon against
the ubiquitous budworm, the areas affected have been relatively small and have not, as yet,
included important spawning streams for salmon. But what happened to stream fish in an area
observed by the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Game is perhaps a portent of things

to come. ‘Immediately after the 1958 spraying,’ the Department reported, ‘moribund suckers
were observed in large numbers in Big Goddard Brook. These fish exhibited the typical
symptoms of DDT poisoning; they swam erratically, gasped at the surface, and exhibited
tremors and spasms. In the first five days after spraying, 668 dead suckers were collected from
two blocking nets. Minnows and suckers were also killed in large numbers in Little Goddard,
Carry, Alder, and Blake Brooks. Fish were often seen floating passively downstream in a
weakened and moribund condition. In several instances, blind and dying trout were found
floating passively downstream more than a week after spraying.’
(The fact that DDT may cause blindness in fish is confirmed by various studies. A Canadian
biologist who observed spraying on northern Vancouver Island in 1957 reported that cutthroat
trout fingerlings could be picked out of the streams by hand, for the fish were moving sluggishly
and made no attempt to escape. On examination, they were found to have an opaque white
film covering the eye, indicating that vision had been impaired or destroyed. Laboratory studies
by the Canadian Department of Fisheries showed that almost all fish [Coho salmon] not actually
killed by exposure to low concentrations of DDT [3 parts per million] showed symptoms of
blindness, with marked opacity of the lens.) Wherever there are great forests, modern methods
of insect control threaten the fishes inhabiting the streams in the shelter of the trees. One of
the best-known examples of fish destruction in the United States took place in 1955, as a result
of spraying in and near Yellowstone National Park. By the fall of that year, so many dead fish
had been found in the Yellowstone River that sportsmen and Montana fish-and-game
administrators became alarmed. About 90 miles of the river were affected. In one 300-yard
length of shoreline, 600 dead fish were counted, including brown trout, whitefish, and suckers.
Stream insects, the natural food of trout, had disappeared. Forest Service officials declared they
had acted on advice that 1 pound of DDT to the acre was ‘safe’. But the results of the spraying
should have been enough to convince anyone that the advice had been far from sound. A
cooperative study was begun in 1956 by the Montana Fish and Game Department and two
federal agencies, the Fish and Wildlife Service and the Forest Service. Spraying in Montana that
year covered 900,000 acres; 800,000 acres were also treated in 1957. The biologists therefore
had no trouble finding areas for their study. Always, the pattern of death assumed a
characteristic shape: the smell of DDT over the forests, an oil film on the water surface, dead
trout along the shoreline. All fish analyzed, whether taken alive or dead, had stored DDT in their
tissues. As in eastern Canada, one of the most serious effects of spraying was the severe
reduction of food organisms. On many study areas aquatic insects and other stream-bottom
fauna were reduced to a tenth of their normal populations. Once destroyed, populations of
these insects, so essential to the survival of trout, take a long time to rebuild. Even by the end
of the second summer after spraying, only meager quantities of aquatic insects had
reestablished themselves, and on one stream—formerly rich in bottom fauna—scarcely any
could be found. In this particular stream, game fish had been reduced by 80 per cent.
The fish do not necessarily die immediately. In fact, delayed mortality may be more extensive
than the immediate kill and, as the Montana biologists discovered, it may go unreported
because it occurs after the fishing season. Many deaths occurred in the study streams among
autumn spawning fish, including brown trout, brook trout, and whitefish. This is not surprising,
because in time of physiological stress the organism, be it fish or man, draws on stored fat for
energy. This exposes it to the full lethal effect of the DDT stored in the tissues.

It was therefore more than clear that spraying at the rate of a pound of DDT to the acre posed a
serious threat to the fishes in forest streams. Moreover, control of the budworm had not been
achieved and many areas were scheduled for re-spraying. The Montana Fish and Game
Department registered strong opposition to further spraying, saying it was ‘not willing to
compromise the sport fishery resource for programs of questionable necessity and doubtful
success.’ The Department declared, however, that it would continue to cooperate with the
Forest Service ‘in determining ways to minimize adverse effects.’
But can such cooperation actually succeed in saving the fish? An experience in British Columbia
speaks volumes on this point. There an outbreak of the black-headed budworm had been
raging for several years. Forestry officials, fearing that another season’s defoliation might result
in severe loss of trees, decided to carry out control operations in 1957. There were many
consultations with the Game Department, whose officials were concerned about the salmon
runs. The Forest Biology Division agreed to modify the spraying program in every possible way
short of destroying its effectiveness, in order to reduce risks to the fish. Despite these
precautions, and despite the fact that a sincere effort was apparently made, in at least four
major streams almost 100 per cent of the salmon were killed.
In one of the rivers, the young of a run of 40,000 adult Coho salmon were almost completely
annihilated. So were the young stages of several thousand steelhead trout and other species of
trout. The Coho salmon has a three-year life cycle and the runs are composed almost entirely of
fish of a single age group. Like other species of salmon, the Coho has a strong homing instinct,
returning to its natal stream. There will be no repopulation from other streams. This means,
then, that every third year the run of salmon into this river will be almost nonexistent, until
such time as careful management, by artificial propagation or other means, has been able to
rebuild this commercially important run. There are ways to solve this problem—to preserve the
forests and to save the fishes, too. To assume that we must resign ourselves to turning our
waterways into rivers of death is to follow the counsel of despair and defeatism. We must make
wider use of alternative methods that are now known, and we must devote our ingenuity and
resources to developing others. There are cases on record where natural parasitism has kept
the budworm under control more effectively than spraying. Such natural control needs to be
utilized to the fullest extent. There are possibilities of using less toxic sprays or, better still, of
introducing microorganisms that will cause disease among the budworms without affecting the
whole web of forest life. We shall see later what some of these alternative methods are and
what they promise.
Meanwhile, it is important to realize that chemical spraying of forest insects is neither the only
way nor the best way. The pesticide threat to fishes may be divided into three parts. One, as we
have seen, relates to the fishes of running streams in northern forests and to the single
problem of forest spraying. It is confined almost entirely to the effects of DDT. Another is vast,
sprawling, and diffuse, for it concerns the many different kinds of fishes—bass, sunfish,
trappies, suckers, and others that inhabit many kinds of waters, still or flowing, in many parts of
the country. It also concerns almost the whole gamut of insecticides now in agricultural use,
although a few principal offenders like endrin, toxaphene, dieldrin, and heptachlor can easily be
picked out. Still another problem must now be considered largely in terms of what we may
logically suppose will happen in the future, because the studies that will disclose the facts are
only beginning to be made. This has to do with the fishes of salt marshes, bays, and estuaries.

It was inevitable that serious destruction of fishes would follow the widespread use of the new
organic pesticides.
Fishes are almost fantastically sensitive to the chlorinated hydrocarbons that make up the bulk
of modern insecticides. And when millions of tons of poisonous chemicals are applied to the
surface of the land, it is inevitable that some of them will find their way into the ceaseless cycle
of waters moving between land and sea. Reports of fish kills, some of disastrous proportions,
have now become so common that the United States Public Health Service has set up an office
to collect such reports from the states as an index of water pollution. This is a problem that
concerns a great many people. Some 25 million Americans look to fishing as a major source of
recreation and another 15 million are at least casual anglers. These people spend three billion
dollars annually for licenses, tackle, boats, camping equipment, gasoline, and lodgings.
Anything that deprives them of their sport will also reach out and affect a large number of
economic interests. The commercial fisheries represent such an interest, and even more
importantly, an essential source of food. Inland and coastal fisheries (excluding the offshore
catch) yield an estimated three billion pounds a year. Yet, as we shall see, the invasion of
streams, ponds, rivers, and bays by pesticides is now a threat to both recreational and
commercial fishing.
Examples of the destruction of fish by agricultural crop sprayings and dustings are everywhere
to be found. In California, for example, the loss of some 60,000 game fish, mostly bluegill and
other sunfish, followed an attempt to control the riceleaf miner with dieldrin. In Louisiana 30 or
more instances of heavy fish mortality occurred in one year alone (1960) because of the use of
endrin in the sugarcane fields. In Pennsylvania fish have been killed in numbers by endrin, used
in orchards to combat mice. The use of chlordane for grasshopper control on the high western
plains has been followed by the death of many stream fish. Probably no other agricultural
program has been carried out on so large a scale as the dusting nd spraying of millions of acres
of land in southern United States to control the fire ant. Heptachlor, the chemical chiefly used,
is only slightly less toxic to fish than DDT. Dieldrin, another fire ant poison, has a welldocumented history of extreme hazard to all aquatic life. Only endrin and toxaphene represent
a greater danger to fish. All areas within the fire ant control area, whether treated with
heptachlor or dieldrin, reported disastrous effects on aquatic life. A few excerpts will give the
flavor of the reports from biologists who studied the damage: From Texas, ‘Heavy loss of
aquatic life despite efforts to protect canals’, ‘Dead fish...were present in all treated water’,
‘Fish kill was heavy and continued for over 3 weeks’. From Alabama, ‘Most adult fish were killed
[in Wilcox County] within a few days after treatment,’ ‘The fish in temporary waters and small
tributary streams appeared to have been completely eradicated.’
In Louisiana, farmers complained of loss in farm ponds. Along one canal more than 500 dead
fish were seen floating or lying on the bank on a stretch of less than a quarter of a mile. In
another parish 150 dead sunfish could be found for every 4 that remained alive. Five other
species appeared to have been wiped out completely. In Florida, fish from ponds in a treated
area were found to contain residues of heptachlor and a derived chemical, heptachlor epoxide.
Included among these fish were sunfish and bass, which of course are favorites of anglers and
commonly find their way to the dinner table. Yet the chemicals they contained are among those
the Food and Drug Administration considers too dangerous for human consumption, even in
minute quantities. So extensive were the reported kills of fish, frogs, and other life of the

waters that the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists, a venerable scientific
organization devoted to the study of fishes, reptiles, and amphibians, passed a resolution in
1958 calling on the Department of Agriculture and the associated state agencies to cease ‘aerial
distribution of heptachlor, dieldrin, and equivalent poisons—before irreparable harm is done.’
The Society called attention to the great variety of species of fish and other forms of life
inhabiting the southeastern part of the United States, including species that occur nowhere else
in the world. ‘Many of these animals,’ the Society warned, ‘occupy only small areas and
therefore might readily be completely exterminated.’ Fishes of the southern states have also
suffered heavily from insecticides used against cotton insects. The summer of 1950 was a
season of disaster in the cotton-growing country of northern Alabama. Before that year, only
limited use had been made of organic insecticides for the control of the boll weevil. But in 1950
there were many weevils because of a series of mild winters, and so an estimated 80 to 95 per
cent of the farmers, on the urging of the county agents, turned to the use of insecticides. The
chemical most popular with the farmers was toxaphene, one of the most destructive to fishes.
Rains were frequent and heavy that summer. They washed the chemicals into the streams, and
as this happened the farmers applied more. An average acre of cotton that year received 63
pounds of toxaphene. Some farmers used as much as 200 pounds per acre; one, in an
extraordinary excess of zeal, applied more than a quarter of a ton to the acre. The results could
easily have been foreseen. What happened in Flint Creek, flowing through 50 miles of Alabama
cotton country before emptying into Wheeler Reservoir, was typical of the region. On August 1,
torrents of rain descended on the Flint Creek watershed. In trickles, in rivulets, and finally in
floods the water poured off the land into the streams. The water level rose six inches in Flint
Creek. By the next morning it was obvious that a great deal more than rain had been carried
into the stream. Fish swam about in aimless circles near the surface. Sometimes one would
throw itself out of the water onto the bank. They could easily be caught; one farmer picked up
several and took them to a spring-fed pool. There, in the pure water, these few recovered. But
in the stream dead fish floated down all day. This was but the prelude to more, for each rain
washed more of the insecticide into the river, killing more fish. The rain of August 10 resulted in
such a heavy fish kill throughout the river that few remained to become victims of the next
surge of poison into the stream, which occurred on August 15. But evidence of the deadly
presence of the chemicals was obtained by placing test goldfish in cages in the river; they were
dead within a day.
The doomed fish of Flint Creek included large numbers of white crappies, a favorite among
anglers. Dead bass and sunfish were also found, occurring abundantly in Wheeler Reservoir,
into which the creek flows. All the rough-fish population of these waters was destroyed also—
the carp, buffalo, drum, gizzard shad, and catfish. None showed signs of disease—only the
erratic movements of the dying and a strange deep wine color of the gills. In the warm enclosed
waters of farm ponds, conditions are very likely to be lethal for fish when insecticides are
applied in the vicinity. As many examples show, the poison is carried in by rains and runoff from
surrounding lands. Sometimes the ponds receive not only contaminated runoff but also a direct
dose as crop-dusting pilots neglect to shut off the duster in passing over a pond. Even without
such complications, normal agricultural use subjects fish to far heavier concentrations of
chemicals than would be required to kill them. In other words, a marked reduction in the
poundages used would hardly alter the lethal situation, for applications of over 0.1 pound per

acre to the pond itself are generally considered hazardous. And the poison, once introduced, is
hard to get rid of. One pond that had been treated with DDT to remove unwanted shiners
remained so poisonous through repeated drainings and flushings that it killed 94 per cent of the
sunfish with which it was later stocked. Apparently the chemical remained in the mud of the
pond bottom.
Conditions are evidently no better now than when the modern insecticides first came into use.
The Oklahoma Wildlife Conservation Department stated in 1961 that reports of fish losses in
farm ponds and small lakes had been coming in at the rate of at least one a week, and that such
reports were increasing. The conditions usually responsible for these losses in Oklahoma were
those made familiar by repetition over the years: the application of insecticides to crops, a
heavy rain, and poison washed into the ponds. In some parts of the world the cultivation of fish
in ponds provides an indispensable source of food. In such places the use of insecticides
without regard for the effects on fish creates immediate problems. In Rhodesia, for example,
the young of an important food fish, the Kafue bream, are killed by exposure to only 0.04 parts
per million of DDT in shallow pools. Even smaller doses of many other insecticides would be
lethal. The shallow waters in which these fish live are favorable mosquito-breeding places. The
problem of controlling mosquitoes and at the same time conserving a fish important in the
Central African diet has obviously not been solved satisfactorily.
Milkfish farming in the Philippines, China, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, and India faces a
similar problem. The milkfish is cultivated in shallow ponds along the coasts of these countries.
Schools of young suddenly appear in the coastal waters (from no one knows where) and are
scooped up and placed in impoundments, where they complete their growth. So important is
this fish as a source of animal protein for the rice-eating millions of Southeast Asia and India
that the Pacific Science Congress has recommended an international effort to search for the
now unknown spawning grounds, in order to develop the farming of these fish on a massive
scale. Yet spraying has been permitted to cause heavy losses in existing impoundments. In the
Philippines aerial spraying for mosquito control has cost pond owners dearly. In one such pond
containing 120,000 milkfish, more than half the fish died after a spray plane had passed over, in
spite of desperate efforts by the owner to dilute the poison by flooding the pond.
One of the most spectacular fish kills of recent years occurred in the Colorado River below
Austin, Texas, in 1961. Shortly after daylight on Sunday morning, January 15, dead fish
appeared in the new Town Lake in Austin and in the river for a distance of about 5 miles below
the lake. None had been seen the day before. On Monday there were reports of dead fish 50
miles downstream. By this time it was clear that a wave of some poisonous substance was
moving down in the river water. By January 21, fish were being killed 100 miles downstream
near La Grange, and a week later the chemicals were doing their lethal work 200 miles below
Austin. During the last week of January the locks on the Intracoastal Waterway were closed to
exclude the toxic waters from Matagorda Bay and divert them into the Gulf of Mexico.
Meanwhile, investigators in Austin noticed an odor associated with the insecticides chlordane
and toxaphene. It was especially strong in the discharge from one of the storm sewers. This
sewer had in the past been associated with trouble from industrial wastes, and when officers of
the Texas Game and Fish Commission followed it back from the lake, they noticed an odor like
that of benzene hexachloride at all openings as far back as a feeder line from a chemical plant.
Among the major products of this plant were DDT, benzene hexachloride, chlordane, and

toxaphene, as well as smaller quantities of other insecticides. The manager of the plant
admitted that quantities of powdered insecticide had been washed into the storm sewer
recently and, more significantly, he acknowledged that such disposal of insecticide spillage and
residues had been common practice for the past 10 years. On searching further, the fishery
officers found other plants where rains or ordinary clean-up waters would carry insecticides
into the sewer. The fact that provided the final link in the chain, however, was the discovery
that a few days before the water in lake and river became lethal to fish the entire storm-sewer
system had been flushed out with several million gallons of water under high pressure to clear
it of debris. This flushing had undoubtedly released insecticides lodged in the accumulation of
gravel, sand, and rubble and carried them into the lake and thence to the river, where chemical
tests later established their presence. As the lethal mass drifted down the Colorado it carried
death before it. For 140 miles downstream from the lake the kill of fish must have been almost
complete, for when seines were used later in an effort to discover whether any fish had
escaped they came up empty. Dead fish of 27 species were observed, totaling about 1000
pounds to a mile of riverbank. There were channel cats, the chief game fish of the river. There
were blue and flathead catfish, bullheads, four species of sunfish, shiners, dace, stone rollers,
largemouth bass, carp, mullet, suckers. There were eels, gar, carp, river carpsuckers, gizzard
shad, and buffalo. Among them were some of the patriarchs of the river, fish that by their size
must have been of great age—many flathead catfish weighing over 25 pounds, some of 60
pounds reportedly picked up by local residents along the river, and a giant blue catfish officially
recorded as weighing 84 pounds. The Game and Fish Commission predicted that even without
further pollution the pattern of the fish population of the river would be altered for years.
Some species—those existing at the limits of their natural range—might never be able to reestablish themselves, and the others could do so only with the aid of extensive stocking
operations by the state. This much of the Austin fish disaster is known, but there was almost
certainly a sequel. The toxic river water was still possessed of its death-dealing power after
passing more than 200 miles downstream. It was regarded as too dangerous to be admitted to
the waters of Matagorda Bay, with its oyster beds and shrimp fisheries, and so the whole toxic
outflow was diverted to the waters of the open Gulf. What were its effects there? And what of
the outflow of scores of other rivers, carrying contaminants perhaps equally lethal?
At present our answers to these questions are for the most part only conjectures, but there is
growing concern about the role of pesticide pollution in estuaries, salt marshes, bays, and other
coastal waters. Not only do these areas receive the contaminated discharge of rivers but all too
commonly they are sprayed directly in efforts to control mosquitoes or other insects.
Nowhere has the effect of pesticides on the life of salt marshes, estuaries, and all quiet inlets
from the sea been more graphically demonstrated than on the eastern coast of Florida, in the
Indian River country. There, in the spring of 1955, some 2000 acres of salt marsh in St. Lucie
County were treated with dieldrin in an attempt to eliminate the larvae of the sandfly. The
concentration used was one pound of active ingredient to the acre. The effect on the life of the
waters was catastrophic. Scientists from the Entomology Research Center of the State Board of
Health surveyed the carnage after the spraying and reported that the fish kill was ‘substantially
complete’. Everywhere dead fishes littered the shores. From the air sharks could be seen
moving in, attracted by the helpless and dying fishes in the water. No species was spared.
Among the dead were mullets, snook, mojarras, gambusia.

The minimum immediate overall kill throughout the marshes, exclusive of the Indian River
shoreline, was 20-30 tons of fishes, or about 1,175,000 fishes, of at least 30 species [reported R.
W. Harrington, Jr. and W.L. Bidlingmayer of the survey team]. Mollusks seemed to be
unharmed by dieldrin. Crustaceans were virtually exterminated throughout the area. The entire
aquatic crab population was apparently destroyed and the fiddler crabs, all but annihilated,
survived temporarily only in patches of marsh evidently missed by the pellets. The larger game
and food fishes succumbed most rapidly...Crabs net upon and destroyed the moribund fishes,
but the next day were dead themselves. Snails continued to devour fish carcasses. After two
weeks, no trace remained of the litter of dead fishes. The same melancholy picture was painted
by the late Dr. Herbert R. Mills from his observations in Tampa Bay on the opposite coast of
Florida, where the National Audubon Society operates a sanctuary for seabirds in the area
including Whiskey Stump Key. The sanctuary ironically became a poor refuge after the local
health authorities undertook a campaign to wipe out the salt-marsh mosquitoes. Again fishes
and crabs were the principal victims. The fiddler crab, that small and picturesque crustacean
whose hordes move over mud flats or sand flats like grazing cattle, has no defense against the
sprayers. After successive sprayings during the summer and fall months (some areas were
sprayed as many as 16 times), the state of the fiddler crabs was summed up by Dr. Mills: ‘A
progressive scarcity of fiddlers had by this time become apparent. Where there should have
been in the neighborhood of 100,000 fiddlers under the tide and weather conditions of the day
[October 12] there were not over 100 which could be seen anywhere on the beach, and these
were all dead or sick, quivering, twitching, stumbling, scarcely able to crawl; although in
neighboring unsprayed areas fiddlers were plentiful.’
The place of the fiddler crab in the ecology of the world it inhabits is a necessary one, not easily
filled. It is an important source of food for many animals. Coastal raccoons feed on them. So do
marsh-inhabiting birds like the clapper rail, shore- birds, and even visiting seabirds. In the New
Jersey salt marsh sprayed with DDT, the normal population of laughing gulls was decreased by
85 per cent for several weeks, presumably because the birds could not find sufficient food after
the spraying. The marsh fiddlers are important in other ways as well, being useful scavengers
and aerating the mud of the marshes by their extensive burrowings. They also furnish
quantities of bait for fishermen. The fiddler crab is not the only creature of tidal marsh and
estuary to be threatened by pesticides; others of more obvious importance to man are
endangered. The famous blue crab of the Chesapeake Bay and other Atlantic Coast areas is an
example. These crabs are so highly susceptible to insecticides that every spraying of creeks,
ditches, and ponds in tidal marshes kills most of the crabs living there. Not only do the local
crabs die, but others moving into a sprayed area from the sea succumb to the lingering poison.
And sometimes poisoning may be indirect, as in the marshes near Indian River, where
scavenger crabs attacked the dying fishes, but soon themselves succumbed to the poison. Less
is known about the hazard to the lobster. However, it belongs to the same group of arthropods
as the blue crab, has essentially the same physiology, and would presumably suffer the same
effects. This would be true also of the stone crab and other crustaceans which have direct
economic importance as human food.
The inshore waters—the bays, the sounds, the river estuaries, the tidal marshes—form an
ecological unit of the utmost importance. They are linked so intimately and indispensably with
the lives of many fishes, mollusks, and crustaceans that were they no longer habitable these

seafoods would disappear from our tables. Even among fishes that range widely in coastal
waters, many depend upon protected inshore areas to serve as nursery and feeding grounds for
their young. Baby tarpon are abundant in all that labyrinth of mangrove-lined streams and
canals bordering the lower third of the western coast of Florida. On the Atlantic Coast the sea
trout, croaker, spot, and drum spawn on sandy shoals off the inlets between the islands or
‘banks’ that lie like a protective chain off much of the coast south of New York. The young fish
hatch and are carried through the inlets by the tides. In the bays and sounds— Currituck,
Pamlico, Bogue, and many others—they find abundant food and grow rapidly. Without these
nursery areas of warm protected, food-rich waters the populations of these and many other
species could not be maintained. Yet we are allowing pesticides to enter them via the rivers and
by direct spraying over bordering marshlands. And the early stages of these fishes, even more
than the adults, are especially susceptible to direct chemical poisoning. Shrimp, too, depend on
inshore feeding grounds for their young. One abundant and widely ranging species supports the
entire commercial fishery of the southern Atlantic and Gulf states. Although spawning occurs at
sea, the young come into the estuaries and bays when a few weeks old to undergo successive
molts and changes of form. There they remain from May or June until fall, feeding on the
bottom detritus. In the entire period of their inshore life, the welfare of the shrimp populations
and of the industry they support depends upon favorable conditions in the estuaries.
Do pesticides represent a threat to the shrimp fisheries and to the supply for the markets? The
answer may be contained in recent laboratory experiments carried out by the Bureau of
Commercial Fisheries. The insecticide tolerance of young commercial shrimp just past larval life
was found to be exceedingly low—measured in parts per billion instead of the more commonly
used standard of parts per million. For example, half the shrimp in one experiment were killed
by dieldrin at a concentration of only 15 per billion. Other chemicals were even more toxic.
Endrin, always one of the most deadly of the pesticides, killed half the shrimp at a
concentration of only half of one part per billion. The threat to oysters and clams is multiple.
Again, the young stages are most vulnerable. These shellfish inhabit the bottoms of bays and
sounds and tidal rivers from New England to Texas and sheltered areas of the Pacific Coast.
Although sedentary in adult life, they discharge their spawn into the sea, where the young are
free-living for a period of several weeks. On a summer day a fine-meshed tow net drawn behind
a boat will collect, along with the other drifting plant and animal life that make up the plankton,
the infinitely small, fragile-as-glass larvae of oysters and clams. No larger than grains of dust,
these transparent larvae swim about in the surface waters, feeding on the microscopic plant life
of the plankton. If the crop of minute sea vegetation fails, the young shellfish will starve. Yet
pesticides may well destroy substantial quantities of plankton. Some of the herbicides in
common use on lawns, cultivated fields, and roadsides and even in coastal marshes are
extraordinarily toxic to the plant plankton which the larval mollusks use as food—some at only
a few parts per billion.
The delicate larvae themselves are killed by very small quantities of many of the common
insecticides. Even exposures to less than lethal quantities may in the end cause death of the
larvae, for inevitably the growth rate is retarded. This prolongs the period the larvae must
spend in the hazardous world of the plankton and so decreases the chance they will live to
adulthood. For adult mollusks there is apparently less danger of direct poisoning, at least by
some of the pesticides. This is not necessarily reassuring, however. Oysters and clams may

concentrate these poisons in their digestive organs and other tissues. Both types of shellfish are
normally eaten whole and sometimes raw. Dr. Philip Butler of the Bureau of Commercial
Fisheries has pointed out an ominous parallel in that we may find ourselves in the same
situation as the robins. The robins, he reminds us, did not die as a direct result of the spraying
of DDT. They died because they had eaten earthworms that had already concentrated the
pesticides in their tissues. . . .
Although the sudden death of thousands of fish or crustaceans in some stream or pond as the
direct and visible effect of insect control is dramatic and alarming, these unseen and as yet
largely unknown and unmeasurable effects of pesticides reaching estuaries indirectly in streams
and rivers may in the end be more disastrous. The whole situation is beset with questions for
which there are at present no satisfactory answers. We know that pesticides contained in
runoff from farms and forests are now being carried to the sea in the waters of many and
perhaps all of the major rivers. But we do not know the identity of all the chemicals or their
total quantity, and we do not presently have any dependable tests for identifying them in highly
diluted state once they have reached the sea. Although we know that the chemicals have
almost certainly undergone change during the long period of transit, we do not know whether
the altered chemical is more toxic than the original or less. Another almost unexplored area is
the question of interactions between chemicals, a question that becomes especially urgent
when they enter the marine environment where so many different minerals are subjected to
mixing and transport. All of these questions urgently require the precise answers that only
extensive research can provide, yet funds for such purposes are pitifully small.
The fisheries of fresh and salt water are a resource of great importance, involving the interests
and the welfare of a very large number of people. That they are now seriously threatened by
the chemicals entering our waters can no longer be doubted. If we would divert to constructive
research even a small fraction of the money spent each year on the development of ever more
toxic sprays, we could find ways to use less dangerous materials and to keep poisons out of our
waterways. When will the public become sufficiently aware of the facts to demand such action?

10. Indiscriminately from the Skies
FROM SMALL BEGINNINGS over farmlands and forests the scope of aerial spraying has
widened and its volume has increased so that it has become what a British ecologist recently
called ‘an amazing rain of death’ upon the surface of the earth. Our attitude towards poisons
has undergone a subtle change. Once they were kept in containers marked with skull and
crossbones; the infrequent occasions of their use were marked with utmost care that they
should come in contact with the target and with nothing else. With the development of the
new organic insecticides and the abundance of surplus planes after the Second World War, all
this was forgotten. Although today’s poisons are more dangerous than any known before, they
have amazingly become something to be showered down indiscriminately from the skies. Not
only the target insect or plant, but anything—human or nonhuman—within range of the
chemical fallout may know the sinister touch of the poison. Not only forests and cultivated
fields are sprayed, but towns and cities as well.
A good many people now have misgivings about the aerial distribution of lethal chemicals over
millions of acres, and two mass-spraying campaigns undertaken in the late 1950s have done
much to increase these doubts. These were the campaigns against the gypsy moth in the
northeastern states and the fire ant in the South. Neither is a native insect but both have been
in this country for many years without creating a situation calling for desperate measures. Yet
drastic action was suddenly taken against them, under the end-justifies-the-means philosophy
that has too long directed the control divisions of our Department of Agriculture.
The gypsy moth program shows what a vast amount of damage can he done when reckless
large-scale treatment is substituted for local and moderate control. The campaign against the
fire ant is a prime example of a campaign based on gross exaggeration of the need for control,
blunderingly launched without scientific knowledge of the dosage of poison required to destroy
the target or of its effects on other life. Neither program has achieved its goal. . . .
The gypsy moth, a native of Europe, has been in the United States for nearly a hundred years. In
1869 a French scientist, Leopold Trouvelot, accidentally allowed a few of these moths to escape
from his laboratory in Medford, Massachusetts, where he was attempting to cross them with
silkworms. Little by little the gypsy moth has spread throughout New England. The primary
agent of its progressive spread is the wind; the larval, or caterpillar, stage is extremely light and
can be carried to considerable heights and over great distances. Another means is the shipment
of plants carrying the egg masses, the form in which the species exists over winter. The gypsy
moth, which in its larval stage attacks the foliage of oak trees and a few other hardwoods for a
few weeks each spring, now occurs in all the New England states. It also occurs sporadically in
New Jersey, where it was introduced in 1911 on a shipment of spruce trees from Holland, and
in Michigan, where its method of entry is not known. The New England hurricane of 1938
carried it into Pennsylvania and New York, but the Adirondacks have generally served as a
barrier to its westward advance, being forested with species not attractive to it.
The task of confining the gypsy moth to the northeastern corner of the country has been
accomplished by a variety of methods, and in the nearly one hundred years since its arrival on
this continent the fear that it would invade the great hardwood forests of the southern
Appalachians has not been justified. Thirteen parasites and predators were imported from

abroad and successfully established in New England. The Agriculture Department itself has
credited these importations with appreciably reducing the frequency and destructiveness of
gypsy moth outbreaks. This natural control, plus quarantine measures and local spraying,
achieved what the Department in 1955 described as ‘outstanding restriction of distribution and
damage’. Yet only a year after expressing satisfaction with the state of affairs, its Plant Pest
Control Division embarked on a program calling for the blanket spraying of several million acres
a year with the announced intention of eventually ‘eradicating’ the gypsy moth. (‘Eradication’
means the complete and final extinction or extermination of a species throughout its range. Yet
as successive programs have failed, the Department has found it necessary to speak of second
or third ‘eradications’ of the same species in the same area.)
The Department’s all-out chemical war on the gypsy moth began on an ambitious scale. In 1956
nearly a million acres were sprayed in the states of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Michigan, and
New York. Many complaints of damage were made by people in the sprayed areas.
Conservationists became increasingly disturbed as the pattern of spraying huge areas began to
establish itself. When plans were announced for spraying 3 million acres in 1957 opposition
became even stronger. State and federal agriculture officials characteristically shrugged off
individual complaints as unimportant. The Long Island area included within the gypsy moth
spraying in 1957 consisted chiefly of heavily populated towns and suburbs and of some coastal
areas with bordering salt marsh. Nassau County, Long Island, is the most densely settled county
in New York apart from New York City itself. In what seems the height of absurdity, the ‘threat
of infestation of the New York City metropolitan area’ has been cited as an important
justification of the program. The gypsy moth is a forest insect, certainly not an inhabitant of
cities. Nor does it live in meadows, cultivated fields, gardens, or marshes. Nevertheless, the
planes hired by the United States Department of Agriculture and the New York Department of
Agriculture and Markets in 1957 showered down the prescribed DDT-in-fuel-oil with
impartiality. They sprayed truck gardens and dairy farms, fish ponds and salt marshes. They
sprayed the quarter-acre lots of suburbia, drenching a housewife making a desperate effort to
cover her garden before the roaring plane reached her, and showering insecticide over children
at play and commuters at railway stations. At Setauket a fine quarter horse drank from a trough
in a field which the planes had sprayed; ten hours later it was dead. Automobiles were spotted
with the oily mixture; flowers and shrubs were ruined. Birds, fish, crabs, and useful insects were
killed.
A group of Long Island citizens led by the world-famous ornithologist Robert Cushman Murphy
had sought a court injunction to prevent the 1957 spraying. Denied a preliminary injunction,
the protesting citizens had to suffer the prescribed drenching with DDT, but thereafter
persisted in efforts to obtain a permanent injunction. But because the act had already been
performed the courts held that the petition for an injunction was ‘moot’. The case was carried
all the way to the Supreme Court, which declined to hear it. Justice William O. Douglas, strongly
dissenting from the decision not to review the case, held that ‘the alarms that many experts
and responsible officials have raised about the perils of DDT underline the public importance of
this case.’
The suit brought by the Long Island citizens at least served to focus public attention on the
growing trend to mass application of insecticides, and on the power and inclination of the
control agencies to disregard supposedly inviolate property rights of private citizens.

The contamination of milk and of farm produce in the course of the gypsy moth spraying came
as an unpleasant surprise to many people. What happened on the 200-acre Waller farm in
northern Westchester County, New York, was revealing. Mrs. Waller had specifically requested
Agriculture officials not to spray her property, because it would be impossible to avoid the
pastures in spraying the woodlands. She offered to have the land checked for gypsy moths and
to have any infestation destroyed by spot spraying. Although she was assured that no farms
would be sprayed, her property received two direct sprayings and, in addition, was twice
subjected to drifting spray. Milk samples taken from the Wallers’ purebred Guernsey cows 48
hours later contained DDT in the amount of 14 parts per million. Forage samples from fields
where the cows had grazed were of course contaminated also. Although the county Health
Department was notified, no instructions were given that the milk should not be marketed. This
situation is unfortunately typical of the lack of consumer protection that is all too common.
Although the Food and Drug Administration permits no residues of pesticides in milk, its
restrictions are not only inadequately policed but they apply solely to interstate shipments.
State and county officials are under no compulsion to follow the federal pesticides tolerances
unless local laws happen to conform—and they seldom do.
Truck gardeners also suffered. Some leaf crops were so burned and spotted as to be
unmarketable. Others carried heavy residues; a sample of peas analyzed at Cornell University’s
Agricultural Experiment Station contained 14 to 20 parts per million of DDT. The legal maximum
is 7 parts per million. Growers therefore had to sustain heavy losses or find themselves in the
position of selling produce carrying illegal residues. Some of them sought and collected
damages. As the aerial spraying of DDT increased, so did the number of suits filed in the courts.
Among them were suits brought by beekeepers in several areas of New York State. Even before
the 1957 spraying, the beekeepers had suffered heavily from use of DDT in orchards. ‘Up to
1953 I had regarded as gospel everything that emanated from the U.S. Department of
Agriculture and the agricultural colleges,’ one of them remarked bitterly. But in May of that
year this man lost 800 colonies after the state had sprayed a large area. So widespread and
heavy was the loss that 14 other beekeepers joined him in suing the state for a quarter of a
million dollars in damages. Another beekeeper, whose 400 colonies were incidental targets of
the 1957 spray, reported that 100 per cent of the field force of bees (the workers out gathering
nectar and pollen for the hives) had been killed in forested areas and up to 50 per cent in
farming areas sprayed less intensively.
‘It is a very distressful thing,’ he wrote, ‘to walk into a yard in May and not hear a bee buzz.’
The gypsy moth programs were marked by many acts of irresponsibility. Because the spray
planes were paid by the gallon rather than by the acre there was no effort to be conservative,
and many properties were sprayed not once but several times. Contracts for aerial spraying
were in at least one case awarded to an out-of-state firm with no local address, which had not
complied with the legal requirement of registering with state officials for the purpose of
establishing legal responsibility. In this exceedingly slippery situation, citizens who suffered
direct financial loss from damage to apple orchards or bees discovered that there was no one to
sue. After the disastrous 1957 spraying the program was abruptly and drastically curtailed, with
vague statements about ‘evaluating’ previous work and testing alternative insecticides. Instead
of the 3½ million acres sprayed in 1957, the treated areas fell to ½ million in 1958 and to about

100,000 acres in 1959, 1960, and 1961. During this interval, the control agencies must have
found news from Long Island disquieting. The gypsy moth had reappeared there in numbers.
The expensive spraying operation that had cost the Department dearly in public confidence and
good will—the operation that was intended to wipe out the gypsy moth for ever—had in reality
accomplished nothing at all. . . .
Meanwhile, the Department’s Plant Pest Control men had temporarily forgotten gypsy moths,
for they had been busy launching an even more ambitious program in the South. The word
‘eradication’ still came easily from the Department’s mimeograph machines; this time the press
releases were promising the eradication of the fire ant. The fire ant, an insect named for its
fiery sting, seems to have entered the United States from South America by way of the port of
Mobile, Alabama, where it was discovered shortly after the end of the First World War. By 1928
it had spread into the suburbs of Mobile and thereafter continued an invasion that has now
carried it into most of the southern states. During most of the forty-odd years since its arrival in
the United States the fire ant seems to have attracted little attention. The states where it was
most abundant considered it a nuisance, chiefly because it builds large nests or mounds a foot
or more high. These may hamper the operation of farm machinery. But only two states listed it
among their 20 most important insect pests, and these placed it near the bottom of the list. No
official or private concern seems to have been felt about the fire ant as a menace to crops or
livestock. With the development of chemicals of broad lethal powers, there came a sudden
change in the official attitude toward the fire ant. In 1957 the United States Department of
Agriculture launched one of the most remarkable publicity campaigns in its history. The fire ant
suddenly became the target of a barrage of government releases, motion pictures, and
government-inspired stories portraying it as a despoiler of southern agriculture and a killer of
birds, livestock, and man. A mighty campaign was announced, in which the federal government
in cooperation with the afflicted states would ultimately treat some 20,000,000 acres in nine
southern states. ‘United States pesticide makers appear to have tapped a sales bonanza in the
increasing numbers of broad-scale pest elimination programs conducted by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture,’ cheerfully reported one trade journal in 1958, as the fire ant
program got under way.
Never has any pesticide program been so thoroughly and deservedly damned by practically
everyone except the beneficiaries of this ‘sales bonanza’. It is an outstanding example of an illconceived, badly executed, and thoroughly detrimental experiment in the mass control of
insects, an experiment so expensive in dollars, in destruction of animal life, and in loss of public
confidence in the Agriculture Department that it is incomprehensible that any funds should still
be devoted to it.
Congressional support of the project was initially won by representations that were later
discredited. The fire ant was pictured as a serious threat to southern agriculture through
destruction of crops and to wildlife because of attacks on the young of ground-nesting birds. Its
sting was said to make it a serious menace to human health. Just how sound were these claims?
The statements made by Department witnesses seeking appropriations were not in accord with
those contained in key publications of the Agriculture Department. The 1957 bulletin Insecticide
Recommendations...for the Control of Insects Attacking Crops and Livestock did not so much as
mention the fire ant—an extraordinary omission if the Department believes its own
propaganda. Moreover, its encyclopedic Yearbook for 1952, which was devoted to insects,

contained only one short paragraph on the fire ant out of its half-million words of text. Against
the Department’s undocumented claim that the fire ant destroys crops and attacks livestock is
the careful study of the Agricultural Experiment Station in the state that has had the most
intimate experience with this insect, Alabama. According to Alabama scientists, ‘damage to
plants in general is rare.’ Dr. F. S. Arant, an entomologist at the Alabama Polytechnic Institute
and in 1961 president of the Entomological Society of America, states that his department ‘has
not received a single report of damage to plants by ants in the past five years...No damage to
livestock has been observed.’ These men, who have actually observed the ants in the field and
in the laboratory, say that the fire ants feed chiefly on a variety of other insects, many of them
considered harmful to man’s interests. Fire ants have been observed picking larvae of the boll
weevil off cotton. Their mound-building activities serve a useful purpose in aerating and
draining the soil. The Alabama studies have been substantiated by investigations at the
Mississippi State University, and are far more impressive than the Agriculture Department’s
evidence, apparently based either on conversations with farmers, who may easily mistake one
ant for another, or on old research. Some entomologists believe that the ant’s food habits have
changed as it has become more abundant, so that observations made several decades ago have
little value now. The claim that the ant is a menace to health and life also bears considerable
modification. The Agriculture Department sponsored a propaganda movie (to gain support for
its program) in which horror scenes were built around the fire ant’s sting. Admittedly this is
painful and one is well advised to avoid being stung, just as one ordinarily avoids the sting of
wasp or bee. Severe reactions may occasionally occur in sensitive individuals, and medical
literature records one death possibly, though not definitely, attributable to fire ant venom. In
contrast to this, the Office of Vital Statistics records 33 deaths in 1959 alone from the sting of
bees and wasps. Yet no one seems to have proposed ‘eradicating’ these insects. Again, local
evidence is most convincing. Although the fire ant has inhabited Alabama for 40 years and is
most heavily concentrated there, the Alabama State Health Officer declares that ‘there has
never been recorded in Alabama a human death resulting from the bites of imported fire ants,’
and considers the medical cases resulting from the bites of fire ants ‘incidental’. Ant mounds on
lawns or playgrounds may create a situation where children are likely to be stung, but this is
hardly an excuse for drenching millions of acres with poisons. These situations can easily be
handled by individual treatment of the mounds.
Damage to game birds was also alleged, without supporting evidence. Certainly a man well
qualified to speak on this issue is the leader of the Wildlife Research Unit at Auburn, Alabama,
Dr. Maurice F. Baker, who has had many years’ experience in the area. But Dr. Baker’s opinion
is directly opposite to the claims of the Agriculture Department. He declares: ‘In south Alabama
and northwest Florida we are able to have excellent hunting and bobwhite populations
coexistent with heavy populations of the imported fire ant...in the almost 40 years that south
Alabama has had the fire ant, game populations have shown a steady and very substantial
increase. Certainly, if the imported fire ant were a serious menace to wildlife, these conditions
could not exist.’ What would happen to wildlife as a result of the insecticide used against the
ants was another matter. The chemicals to be used were dieldrin and heptachlor, both
relatively new. There was little experience of field use for either, and no one knew what their
effects would be on wild birds, fishes, or mammals when applied on a massive scale. It was
known, however, that both poisons were many times more toxic than DDT, which had been

used by that time for approximately a decade, and had killed some birds and many fish even at
a rate of 1 pound per acre. And the dosage of dieldrin and heptachlor was heavier—2 pounds to
the acre under most conditions, or 3 pounds of dieldrin if the white-fringed beetle was also to
be controlled. In terms of their effects on birds, the prescribed use of heptachlor would be
equivalent to 20 pounds of DDT to the acre, that of dieldrin to 120 pounds!
Urgent protests were made by most of the state conservation departments, by national
conservation agencies, and by ecologists and even by some entomologists, calling upon the
then Secretary of Agriculture, Ezra Benson, to delay the program at least until some research
had been done to determine the effects of heptachlor and dieldrin on wild and domestic
animals and to find the minimum amount that would control the ants. The protests were
ignored and the program was launched in 1958. A million acres were treated the first year. It
was clear that any research would be in the nature of a post mortem.
As the program continued, facts began to accumulate from studies made by biologists of state
and federal wildlife agencies and several universities. The studies revealed losses running all the
way up to complete destruction of wildlife on some of the treated areas. Poultry, livestock, and
pets were also killed. The Agriculture Department brushed away all evidence of damage as
exaggerated and misleading.
The facts, however, continue to accumulate. In Hardin County, Texas, for example, opossums,
armadillos, and an abundant raccoon population virtually disappeared after the chemical was
laid down. Even the second autumn after treatment these animals were scarce. The few
raccoons then found in the area carried residues of the chemical in their tissues. Dead birds
found in the treated areas had absorbed or swallowed the poisons used against the fire ants, a
fact clearly shown by chemical analysis of their tissues. (The only bird surviving in any numbers
was the house sparrow, which in other areas too has given some evidence that it may be
relatively immune.) On a tract in Alabama treated in 1959 half of the birds were killed. Species
that live on the ground or frequent low vegetation suffered 100 per cent mortality. Even a
year after treatment, a spring die-off of songbirds occurred and much good nesting territory lay
silent and unoccupied. In Texas, dead blackbirds, dickcissels, and meadowlarks were found at
the nests, and many nests were deserted. When specimens of dead birds from Texas, Louisiana,
Alabama, Georgia, and Florida were sent to the Fish and Wildlife Service for analysis, more than
90 per cent were found to contain residues of dieldrin or a form of heptachlor, in amounts up
to 38 parts per million.
Woodcocks, which winter in Louisiana but breed in the North, now carry the taint of the fire ant
poisons in their bodies. The source of this contamination is clear. Woodcocks feed heavily on
earthworms, which they probe for with their long bills. Surviving worms in Louisiana were
found to have as much as 20 parts per million of heptachlor in their tissues 6 to 10 months after
treatment of the area. A year later they had up to 10 parts per million. The consequences of the
sublethal poisoning of the woodcock are now seen in a marked decline in the proportion of
young birds to adults, first observed in the season after fire ant treatments began. Some of the
most upsetting news for southern sportsmen concerned the bobwhite quail. This bird, a ground
nester and forager, was all but eliminated on treated areas. In Alabama, for example, biologists
of the Alabama Cooperative Wildlife Research Unit conducted a preliminary census of the quail
population in a 3600-acre area that was scheduled for treatment. Thirteen resident coveys—
121 quail—ranged over the area. Two weeks after treatment only dead quail could be found. All

specimens sent to the Fish and Wildlife Service for analysis were found to contain insecticides
in amounts sufficient to cause their death. The Alabama findings were duplicated in Texas,
where a 2500-acre area treated with heptachlor lost all of its quail. Along with the quail went
90 per cent of the songbirds. Again, analysis revealed the presence of heptachlor in the tissues
of dead birds.
In addition to quail, wild turkeys were seriously reduced by the fire ant program. Although 80
turkeys had been counted on an area in Wilcox County, Alabama, before heptachlor was
applied, none could be found the summer after treatment—none, that is, except a clutch of
unhatched eggs and one dead poult. The wild turkeys may have suffered the same fate as their
domestic brethren, for turkeys on farms in the area treated with chemicals also produced few
young. Few eggs hatched and almost no young survived. This did not happen on nearby
untreated areas. The fate of the turkeys was by no means unique. One of the most widely
known and respected wildlife biologists in the country, Dr. Clarence Cottam, called on some of
the farmers whose property had been treated. Besides remarking that ‘all the little tree birds’
seemed to have disappeared after the land had been treated, most of these people reported
losses of livestock, poultry, and household pets. One man was ‘irate against the control
workers,’ Dr. Cottam reported, ‘as he said he buried or otherwise disposed of 19 carcasses of
his cows that had been killed by the poison and he knew of three or four additional cows that
died as a result of the same treatment. Calves died that had been given only milk since birth.’
The people Dr. Cottam interviewed were puzzled by what had happened in the months
following the treatment of their land. One woman told him she had set several hens after the
surrounding land had been covered with poison, ‘and for reasons she did not understand very
few young were hatched or survived.’ Another farmer ‘raises hogs and for fully nine months
after the broadcast of poisons, he could raise no young pigs. The litters were born dead or they
died after birth.’ A similar report came from another, who said that out of 37 litters that might
have numbered as many as 250 young, only 31 little pigs survived. This man had also been quite
unable to raise chickens since the land was poisoned. The Department of Agriculture has
consistently denied livestock losses related to the fire ant program. However, a veterinarian in
Bainbridge, Georgia, Dr. Otis L. Poitevint, who was called upon to treat many of the affected
animals, has summarized his reasons for attributing the deaths to the insecticide as follows.
Within a period of two weeks to several months after the fire ant poison was applied, cattle,
goats, horses, chickens, and birds and other wildlife began to suffer an often fatal disease of the
nervous system. It affected only animals that had access to contaminated food or water.
Stabled animals were not affected. The condition was seen only in areas treated for fire ants.
Laboratory tests for disease were negative. The symptoms observed by Dr. Poitevint and other
veterinarians were those described in authoritative texts as indicating poisoning by dieldrin or
heptachlor.
Dr. Poitevint also described an interesting case of a two-month-old calf that showed symptoms
of poisoning by heptachlor. The animal was subjected to exhaustive laboratory tests. The only
significant finding was the discovery of 79 parts per million of heptachlor in its fat. But it was
five months since the poison had been applied. Did the calf get it directly from grazing or
indirectly from its mother’s milk or even before birth? ‘If from the milk,’ asked Dr. Poitevint,
‘why were not special precautions taken to protect our children who drank milk from local
dairies?’ Dr. Poitevint’s report brings up a significant problem about the contamination of milk.

The area included in the fire ant program is predominantly fields and croplands. What about
the dairy cattle that graze on these lands? In treated fields the grasses will inevitably carry
residues of heptachlor in one of its forms, and if the residues are eaten by the cows the poison
will appear in the milk. This direct transmission into milk had been demonstrated
experimentally for heptachlor in 1955, long before the control program was undertaken, and
was later reported for dieldrin, also used in the fire ant program.
The Department of Agriculture’s annual publications now list heptachlor and dieldrin among
the chemicals that make forage plants unsuitable for feeding to dairy animals or animals being
finished for slaughter, yet the control divisions of the Department promote programs that
spread heptachlor and dieldrin over substantial areas of grazing land in the South. Who is
safeguarding the consumer to see that no residues of dieldrin or heptachlor are appearing in
milk? The United States Department of Agriculture would doubtless answer that it has advised
farmers to keep milk cows out of treated pastures for 30 to 90 days. Given the small size of
many of the farms and the largescale nature of the program—much of the chemical applied by
planes—it is extremely doubtful that this recommendation was followed or could be. Nor is the
prescribed period adequate in view of the persistent nature of the residues.
The Food and Drug Administration, although frowning on the presence of any pesticide
residues in milk, has little authority in this situation. In most of the states included in the fire
ant program the dairy industry is small and its products do not cross state lines. Protection of
the milk supply endangered by a federal program is therefore left to the states themselves.
Inquiries addressed to the health officers or other appropriate officials of Alabama, Louisiana,
and Texas in 1959 revealed that no tests had been made and that it simply was not known
whether the milk was contaminated with pesticides or not.
Meanwhile, after rather than before the control program was launched, some research into the
peculiar nature of heptachlor was done. Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that
someone looked up the research already published, since the basic fact that brought about
belated action by the federal government had been discovered several years before, and
should have influenced the initial handling of the program. This is the fact that heptachlor, after
a short period in the tissues of animals or plants or in the soil, assumes a considerably more
toxic form known as heptachlor epoxide. The epoxide is popularly described as ‘an oxidation
product’ produced by weathering. The fact that this transformation could occur had been
known since 1952, when the Food and Drug Administration discovered that female rats, fed 30
parts per million of heptachlor, had stored 165 parts per million of the more poisonous epoxide
only 2 weeks later. These facts were allowed to come out of the obscurity of biological
literature in 1959, when the Food and Drug Administration took action which had the effect of
banning any residues of heptachlor or its epoxide on food. This ruling put at least a temporary
damper on the program; although the Agriculture Department continued to press for its annual
appropriations for fire ant control, local agricultural agents became increasingly reluctant to
advise farmers to use chemicals which would probably result in their crops being legally
unmarketable.
In short, the Department of Agriculture embarked on its program without even elementary
investigation of what was already known about the chemical to be used—or if it investigated, it
ignored the findings. It must also have failed to do preliminary research to discover the
minimum amount of the chemical that would accomplish its purpose. After three years of

heavy dosages, it abruptly reduced the rate of application of heptachlor from 2 pounds to 1¼
pounds per acre in 1959; later on to ½ pound per acre, applied in two treatments of ¼ pound
each, 3 to 6 months apart. An official of the Department explained that ‘an aggressive methods
improvement program’ showed the lower rate to be effective. Had this information been
acquired before the program was launched, a vast amount of damage could have been avoided
and the taxpayers could have been saved a great deal of money. In 1959, perhaps in an attempt
to offset the growing dissatisfaction with the program, the Agriculture Department offered the
chemicals free to Texas landowners who would sign a release absolving federal, state, and local
governments of responsibility for damage. In the same year the State of Alabama, alarmed and
angry at the damage done by the chemicals, refused to appropriate any further funds for the
project. One of its officials characterized the whole program as ‘ill advised, hastily conceived,
poorly planned, and a glaring example of riding roughshod over the responsibilities of other
public and private agencies’. Despite the lack of state funds, federal money continued to trickle
into Alabama, and in 1961 the legislature was again persuaded to make a small appropriation.
Meanwhile, farmers in Louisiana showed growing reluctance to sign up for the project as it
became evident that use of chemicals against the fire ant was causing an upsurge of insects
destructive to sugarcane. Moreover, the program was obviously accomplishing nothing. Its
dismal state was tersely summarized in the spring of 1962 by the director of entomology
research at Louisiana State University Agricultural Experiment Station, Dr. L. D. Newsom: ‘The
imported fire ant “eradication” program which has been conducted by state and federal
agencies is thus far a failure. There are more infested acres in Louisiana now than when the
program began.’
A swing to more sane and conservative methods seems to have begun. Florida, reporting that
‘there are more fire ants in Florida now than there were when the program started,’ announced
it was abandoning any idea of a broad eradication program and would instead concentrate on
local control. Effective and inexpensive methods of local control have been known for years.
The mound-building habit of the fire ant makes the chemical treatment of individual mounds a
simple matter. Cost of such treatment is about one dollar per acre. For situations where
mounds are numerous and mechanized methods are desirable, a cultivator which first levels
and then applies chemical directly to the mounds has been developed by Mississippi’s
Agricultural Experiment Station. The method gives 90 to 95 per cent control of the ants. Its cost
is only $0.23 per acre. The Agriculture Department’s mass control program, on the other hand,
cost about $3.50 per acre—the most expensive, the most damaging, and the least effective
program of all.

11. Beyond the Dreams of the Borgias
THE CONTAMINATION of our world is not alone a matter of mass spraying. Indeed, for
most of us this is of less importance than the innumerable small-scale exposures to which we
are subjected day by day, year after year. Like the constant dripping of water that in turn wears
away the hardest stone, this birth-to-death contact with dangerous chemicals may in the end
prove disastrous. Each of these recurrent exposures, no matter how slight, contributes to the
progressive buildup of chemicals in our bodies and so to cumulative poisoning. Probably no
person is immune to contact with this spreading contamination unless he lives in the most
isolated situation imaginable. Lulled by the soft sell and the hidden persuader, the average
citizen is seldom aware of the deadly materials with which he is surrounding himself: indeed, he
may not realize he is using them at all. So thoroughly has the age of poisons become
established that anyone may walk into a store and, without questions being asked, buy
substances of far greater death-dealing power than the medicinal drug for which he may be
required to sign a ‘poison book’ in the pharmacy next door. A few minutes’ research in any
supermarket is enough to alarm the most stouthearted customer—provided, that is, he has
even a rudimentary knowledge of the chemicals presented for his choice.
If a huge skull and crossbones were suspended above the insecticide department the customer
might at least enter it with the respect normally accorded death-dealing materials. But instead
the display is homey and cheerful, and, with the pickles and olives across the aisle and the bath
and laundry soaps adjoining, the rows upon rows of insecticides are displayed. Within easy
reach of a child’s exploring hand are chemicals in glass containers. If dropped to the floor by a
child or careless adult everyone nearby could be splashed with the same chemical that has sent
spraymen using it into convulsions. These hazards of course follow the purchaser right into his
home. A can of a mothproofing material containing , for example, carries in very fine print the
warning that its contents are under pressure and that it may burst if exposed to heat or open
flame. A common insecticide for household use, including assorted uses in the kitchen, is
chlordane. Yet the Food and Drug Administration’s chief pharmacologist has declared the
hazard of living in a house sprayed with chlordane to be ‘very great’. Other household
preparations contain the even more toxic dieldrin.
Use of poisons in the kitchen is made both attractive and easy. Kitchen shelf paper, white or
tinted to match one’s color scheme, may be impregnated with insecticide, not merely on one
but on both sides. Manufacturers offer us do-it-yourself booklets on how to kill bugs. With
push-button ease, one may send a fog of dieldrin into the most inaccessible nooks and crannies
of cabinets, corners, and baseboards. If we are troubled by mosquitoes, chiggers, or other
insect pests on our persons we have a choice of innumerable lotions, creams, and sprays for
application to clothing or skin. Although we are warned that some of these will dissolve varnish,
paint, and synthetic fabrics, we are presumably to infer that the human skin is impervious to
chemicals. To make certain that we shall at all times be prepared to repel insects, an exclusive
New York store advertises a pocket-sized insecticide dispenser, suitable for the purse or for
beach, golf, or fishing gear.
We can polish our floors with a wax guaranteed to kill any insect that walks over it. We can
hang strips impregnated with the chemical lindane in our closets and garment bags or place

them in our bureau drawers for a half year’s freedom from worry over moth damage. The
advertisements contain no suggestion that lindane is dangerous. Neither do the ads for an
electronic device that dispenses lindane fumes—we are told that it is safe and odorless. Yet the
truth of the matter is that the American Medical Association considers lindane vaporizers so
dangerous that it conducted an extended campaign against them in its Journal.
The Department of Agriculture, in a Home and Garden Bulletin, advises us to spray our clothing
with oil solutions of DDT, dieldrin, chlordane, or any of several other moth killers. If excessive
spraying results in a white deposit of insecticide on the fabric, this may be removed by
brushing, the Department says, omitting to caution us to be careful where and how the
brushing is done. All these matters attended to, we may round out our day with insecticides by
going to sleep under a mothproof blanket impregnated with dieldrin. Gardening is now firmly
linked with the super poisons. Every hardware store, garden-supply shop, and supermarket has
rows of insecticides for every conceivable horticultural situation. Those who fail to make wide
use of this array of lethal sprays and dusts are by implication remiss, for almost every
newspaper’s garden page and the majority of the gardening magazines take their use for
granted. So extensively are even the rapidly lethal organic phosphorus insecticides applied to
lawns and ornamental plants that in 1960 the Florida State Board of Health found it necessary
to forbid the commercial use of pesticides in residential areas by anyone who had not first
obtained a permit and met certain requirements. A number of deaths from parathion had
occurred in Florida before this regulation was adopted.
Little is done, however, to warn the gardener or homeowner that he is handling extremely
dangerous materials. On the contrary, a constant stream of new gadgets make it easier to use
poisons on lawn and garden—and increase the gardener’s contact with them. One may get a
jar-type attachment for the garden hose, for example, by which such extremely dangerous
chemicals as chlordane or dieldrin are applied as one waters the lawn. Such a device is not only
a hazard to the person using the hose, it is also a public menace. The New York Times found it
necessary to issue a warning on its garden page to the effect that unless special protective
devices were installed poisons might get to the water supply by back siphonage. Considering
the number of such devices that are in use, and the scarcity of warnings such as this, do we
need to wonder why our public waters are contaminated?
As an example of what may happen to the gardener himself, we might look at the case of a
physician—an enthusiastic sparetime gardener—who began using DDT and then malathion on
his shrubs and lawn, making regular weekly applications. Sometimes he applied the chemicals
with a hand spray, sometimes with an attachment to his hose. In doing so, his skin and clothing
were often soaked with spray. After about a year of this sort of thing, he suddenly collapsed
and was hospitalized. Examination of a biopsy specimen of fat showed an accumulation of 23
parts per million of DDT. There was extensive nerve damage, which his physicians regarded as
permanent. As time went on he lost weight, suffered extreme fatigue, and experienced a
peculiar muscular weakness, a characteristic effect of malathion. All of these persisting effects
were severe enough to make it difficult for the physician to carry on his practice. Besides the
once innocuous garden hose, power mowers also have been fitted with devices for the
dissemination of pesticides, attachments that will dispense a cloud of vapor as the homeowner
goes about the task of mowing his lawn. So to the potentially dangerous fumes from gasoline

are added the finely divided particles of whatever insecticide the probably unsuspecting
suburbanite has chosen to distribute, raising the level of air pollution above his own grounds to
something few cities could equal. Yet little is said about the hazards of the fad of gardening by
poisons, or of insecticides used in the home; warnings on labels are printed so inconspicuously
in small type that few take the trouble to read or follow them. An industrial firm recently
undertook to find out just how few. Its survey indicated that fewer than fifteen people out of a
hundred of those using insecticide aerosols and sprays are even aware of the warnings on the
containers.
The mores of suburbia now dictate that crabgrass must go at whatever cost. Sacks containing
chemicals designed to rid the lawn of such despised vegetation have become almost a status
symbol. These weed-killing chemicals are sold under brand names that never suggest their
identity or nature. To learn that they contain chlordane or dieldrin one must read exceedingly
fine print placed on the least conspicuous part of the sack. The descriptive literature that may
be picked up in any hardware or garden-supply store seldom if ever reveals the true hazard
involved in handling or applying the material. Instead, the typical illustration portrays a happy
family scene, father and son smilingly preparing to apply the chemical to the lawn, small
children tumbling over the grass with a dog. . . .
The question of chemical residues on the food we eat is a hotly debated issue. The existence of
such residues is either played down by the industry as unimportant or is flatly denied.
Simultaneously, there is a strong tendency to brand as fanatics or cultists all who are so
perverse as to demand that their food be free of insect poisons. In all this cloud of controversy,
what are the actual facts? It has been medically established that, as common sense would tell
us, persons who lived and died before the dawn of the DDT era (about 1942) contained no trace
of DDT or any similar material in their tissues. As mentioned in Chapter 3, samples of body fat
collected from the general population between 1954 and 1956 averaged from 5.3 to 7.4 parts
per million of DDT. There is some evidence that the average level has risen since then to a
consistently higher figure, and individuals with occupational or other special exposures to
insecticides of course store even more. Among the general population with no known gross
exposures to insecticides it may be assumed that much of the DDT stored in fat deposits has
entered the body in food. To test this assumption, a scientific team from the United States
Public Health Service sampled restaurant and institutional meals. Every meal sampled
contained DDT. From this the investigators concluded reasonably enough, that ‘few if any foods
can be relied upon to be entirely free of DDT.’ The quantities in such meals may be enormous.
In a separate Public Health Service study, analysis of prison meals disclosed such items as
stewed dried fruit containing 69.6 parts per million and bread containing 100.9 parts per million
of DDT! In the diet of the average home, meats and any products derived from animal fats
contain the heaviest residues of chlorinated hydrocarbons. This is because these chemicals are
soluble in fat. Residues on fruits and vegetables tend to be somewhat less. These are little
affected by washing—the only remedy is to remove and discard all outside leaves of such
vegetables as lettuce or cabbage, to peel fruit and to use no skins or outer covering whatever.
Cooking does not destroy residues.
Milk is one of the few foods in which no pesticide residues are permitted by Food and Drug
Administration regulations. In actual fact, however, residues turn up whenever a check is made.
They are heaviest in butter and other manufactured dairy products. A check of 461 samples of

such products in 1960 showed that a third contained residues, a situation which the Food and
Drug Administration characterized as ‘far from encouraging’. To find a diet free from DDT and
related chemicals, it seems one must go to a remote and primitive land, still lacking the
amenities of civilization. Such a land appears to exist, at least marginally, on the far Arctic
shores of Alaska— although even there one may see the approaching shadow. When scientists
investigated the native diet of the Eskimos in this region it was found to be free from
insecticides. The fresh and dried fish; the fat, oil, or meat from beaver, beluga, caribou, moose,
oogruk, polar bear, and walrus; cranberries, salmonberries and wild rhubarb all had so far
escaped contamination. There was only one exception—two white owls from Point Hope
carried small amounts of DDT, perhaps acquired in the course of some migratory journey.
When some of the Eskimos themselves were checked by analysis of fat samples, small residues
of DDT were found (0 to 1.9 parts per million). The reason for this was clear. The fat samples
were taken from people who had left their native villages to enter the United States Public
Health Service Hospital in Anchorage for surgery. There the ways of civilization prevailed, and
the meals in this hospital were found to contain as much DDT as those in the most populous
city. For their brief stay in civilization the Eskimos were rewarded with a taint of poison. The
fact that every meal we eat carries its load of chlorinated hydrocarbons is the inevitable
consequence of the almost universal spraying or dusting of agricultural crops with these
poisons. If the farmer scrupulously follows the instructions on the labels, his use of agricultural
chemicals will produce no residues larger than are permitted by the Food and Drug
Administration. Leaving aside for the moment the question whether these legal residues are as
‘safe’ as they are represented to be, there remains the well-known fact that farmers very
frequently exceed the prescribed dosages, use the chemical too close to the time of harvest,
use several insecticides where one would do, and in other ways display the common human
failure to read the fine print.
Even the chemical industry recognizes the frequent misuse of insecticides and the need for
education of farmers. One of its leading trade journals recently declared that ‘many users do
not seem to understand that they may exceed insecticide tolerances if they use higher dosages
than recommended. And haphazard use of insecticides on many crops may be based on
farmers’ whims.’ The files of the Food and Drug Administration contain records of a disturbing
number of such violations. A few examples will serve to illustrate the disregard of directions: a
lettuce farmer who applied not one but eight different insecticides to his crop within a short
time of harvest, a shipper who had used the deadly parathion on celery in an amount five times
the recommended maximum, growers using endrin—most toxic of all the chlorinated
hydrocarbons—on lettuce although no residue was allowable, spinach sprayed with DDT a
week before harvest. There are also cases of chance or accidental contamination. Large lots of
green coffee in burlap bags have become contaminated while being transported by vessels also
carrying a cargo of insecticides. Packaged foods in warehouses are subjected to repeated
aerosol treatments with DDT, lindane, and other insecticides, which may penetrate the
packaging materials and occur in measurable quantities on the contained foods. The longer the
food remains in storage, the greater the danger of contamination.
To the question ‘But doesn’t the government protect us from such things?’ the answer is, ‘Only
to a limited extent.’ The activities of the Food and Drug Administration in the field of consumer
protection against pesticides are severely limited by two facts. The first is that it has jurisdiction

only over foods shipped in interstate commerce; foods grown and marketed within a state are
entirely outside its sphere of authority, no matter what the violation. The second and critically
limiting fact is the small number of inspectors on its staff—fewer than 600 men for all its varied
work. According to a Food and Drug official, only an infinitesimal part of the crop products
moving in interstate commerce—far less than 1 per cent—can be checked with existing
facilities, and this is not enough to have statistical significance. As for food produced and sold
within a state, the situation is even worse, for most states have woefully inadequate laws in this
field. The system by which the Food and Drug Administration establishes maximum permissible
limits of contamination, called ‘tolerances’, has obvious defects. Under the conditions
prevailing it provides mere paper security and promotes a completely unjustified impression
that safe limits have been established and are being adhered to. As to the safety of allowing a
sprinkling of poisons on our food—a little on this, a little on that—many people contend, with
highly persuasive reasons, that no poison is safe or desirable on food. In setting a tolerance
level the Food and Drug Administration reviews tests of the poison on laboratory animals and
then establishes a maximum level of contamination that is much less than required to produce
symptoms in the test animal. This system, which is supposed to ensure safety, ignores a
number of important facts. A laboratory animal, living under controlled and highly artificial
conditions, consuming a given amount of a specific chemical, is very different from a human
being whose exposures to pesticides are not only multiple but for the most part unknown,
unmeasurable, and uncontrollable. Even if 7 parts per million of DDT on the lettuce in his
luncheon salad were ‘safe’, the meal includes other foods, each with allowable residues, and
the pesticides on his food are, as we have seen, only a part, and possibly a small part, of his
total exposure. This piling up of chemicals from many different sources creates a total exposure
that cannot be measured. It is meaningless, therefore, to talk about the ‘safety’ of any specific
amount of residue.
And there are other defects. Tolerances have sometimes been established against the better
judgment of Food and Drug Administration scientists, as in the case cited on page 175 ff., or
they have been established on the basis of inadequate knowledge of the chemical concerned.
Better information has led to later reduction or withdrawal of the tolerance, but only after the
public has been exposed to admittedly dangerous levels of the chemical for months or years.
This happened when heptachlor was given a tolerance that later had to be revoked. For some
chemicals no practical field method of analysis exists before a chemical is registered for use.
Inspectors are therefore frustrated in their search for residues. This difficulty greatly hampered
the work on the ‘cranberry chemical’, aminotriazole. Analytical methods are lacking, too, for
certain fungicides in common use for the treatment of seeds—seeds which if unused at the end
of the planting season, may very well find their way into human food.
In effect, then, to establish tolerances is to authorize contamination of public food supplies with
poisonous chemicals in order that the farmer and the processor may enjoy the benefit of
cheaper production—then to penalize the consumer by taxing him to maintain a policing
agency to make certain that he shall not get a lethal dose. But to do the policing job properly
would cost money beyond any legislator’s courage to appropriate, given the present volume
and toxicity of agricultural chemicals. So in the end the luckless consumer pays his taxes but
gets his poisons regardless. What is the solution? The first necessity is the elimination of
tolerances on the chlorinated hydrocarbons, the organic phosphorus group, and other highly

toxic chemicals. It will immediately be objected that this will place an intolerable burden on the
farmer. But if, as is now the presumable goal, it is possible to use chemicals in such a way that
they leave a residue of only 7 parts per million (the tolerance for DDT), or of 1 part per million
(the tolerance for parathion), or even of only 0.1 part per million as is required for dieldrin on a
great variety of fruits and vegetables, then why is it not possible, with only a little more care, to
prevent the occurrence of any residues at all? This, in fact, is what is required for some
chemicals such as heptachlor, endrin, and dieldrin on certain crops. If it is considered practical
in these instances, why not for all?
But this is not a complete or final solution, for a zero tolerance on paper is of little value. At
present, as we have seen, more than 99 per cent of the interstate food shipments slip by
without inspection. A vigilant and aggressive Food and Drug Administration, with a greatly
increased force of inspectors, is another urgent need. This system, however—deliberately
poisoning our food, then policing the result—is too reminiscent of Lewis Carroll’s White Knight
who thought of ‘a plan to dye one’s whiskers green, and always use so large a fan that they
could not be seen.’ The ultimate answer is to use less toxic chemicals so that the public hazard
from their misuse is greatly reduced. Such chemicals already exist: the pyrethrins, rotenone,
ryania, and others derived from plant substances. Synthetic substitutes for the pyrethrins have
recently been developed, and some of the producing countries stand ready to increase the
output of the natural product as the market may require. Public education as to the nature of
the chemicals offered for sale is sadly needed. The average purchaser is completely bewildered
by the array of available insecticides, fungicides, and weed killers, and has no way of knowing
which are the deadly ones, which reasonably safe.
In addition to making this change to less dangerous agricultural pesticides, we should diligently
explore the possibilities of nonchemical methods. Agricultural use of insect diseases, caused by
a bacterium highly specific for certain types of insects, is already being tried in California, and
more extended tests of this method are under way. A great many other possibilities exist for
effective insect control by methods that will leave no residues on foods (see Chapter 17). Until a
large-scale conversion to these methods has been made, we shall have little relief from a
situation that, by any commonsense standards, is intolerable. As matters stand now, we are in
little better position than the guests of the Borgias.

12. The Human Price
AS THE TIDE of chemicals born of the Industrial Age has arisen to engulf our
environment, a drastic change has come about in the nature of the most serious public health
problems. Only yesterday mankind lived in fear of the scourges of smallpox, cholera, and plague
that once swept nations before them. Now our major concern is no longer with the disease
organisms that once were omnipresent; sanitation, better living conditions, and new drugs
have given us a high degree of control over infectious disease. Today we are concerned with a
different kind of hazard that lurks in our environment—a hazard we ourselves have introduced
into our world as our modern way of life has evolved.
The new environmental health problems are multiple—created by radiation in all its forms,
born of the never-ending stream of chemicals of which pesticides are a part, chemicals now
pervading the world in which we live, acting upon us directly and indirectly, separately and
collectively. Their presence casts a shadow that is no less ominous because it is formless and
obscure, no less frightening because it is simply impossible to predict the effects of lifetime
exposure to chemical and physical agents that are not part of the biological experience of man.
‘We all live under the haunting fear that something may corrupt the environment to the point
where man joins the dinosaurs as an obsolete form of life,’ says Dr. David Price of the United
States Public Health Service. ‘And what makes these thoughts all the more disturbing is the
knowledge that our fate could perhaps be sealed twenty or more years before the
development of symptoms.’ Where do pesticides fit into the picture of environmental disease?
We have seen that they now contaminate soil, water, and food, that they have the power to
make our streams fishless and our gardens and woodlands silent and birdless. Man, however
much he may like to pretend the contrary, is part of nature. Can he escape a pollution that is
now so thoroughly distributed throughout our world?
We know that even single exposures to these chemicals, if the amount is large enough, can
precipitate acute poisoning. But this is not the major problem. The sudden illness or death of
farmers, spraymen, pilots, and others exposed to appreciable quantities of pesticides are tragic
and should not occur. For the population as a whole, we must be more concerned with the
delayed effects of absorbing small amounts of the pesticides that invisibly contaminate our
world. Responsible public health officials have pointed out that the biological effects of
chemicals are cumulative over long periods of time, and that the hazard to the individual may
depend on the sum of the exposures received throughout his lifetime. For these very reasons
the danger is easily ignored. It is human nature to shrug off what may seem to us a vague threat
of future disaster. ‘Men are naturally most impressed by diseases which have obvious
manifestations,’ says a wise physician, Dr. René Dubos, ‘yet some of their worst enemies creep
on them unobtrusively.’ For each of us, as for the robin in Michigan or the salmon in the
Miramichi, this is a problem of ecology, of interrelationships, of interdependence. We poison
the caddis flies in a stream and the salmon runs dwindle and die. We poison the gnats in a lake
and the poison travels from link to link of the food chain and soon the birds of the lake margins
become its victims. We spray our elms and the following springs are silent of robin song, not
because we sprayed the robins directly but because the poison traveled, step by step, through
the now familiar elm leaf-earthworm-robin cycle. These are matters of record, observable, part

of the visible world around us. They reflect the web of life—or death—that scientists know as
ecology.
But there is also an ecology of the world within our bodies. In this unseen world minute causes
produce mighty effects; the effect, moreover, is often seemingly unrelated to the cause,
appearing in a part of the body remote from the area where the original injury was sustained.
‘A change at one point, in one molecule even, may reverberate throughout the entire system to
initiate changes in seemingly unrelated organs and tissues,’ says a recent summary of the
present status of medical research. When one is concerned with the mysterious and wonderful
functioning of the human body, cause and effect are seldom simple and easily demonstrated
relationships. They may be widely separated both in space and time. To discover the agent of
disease and death depends on a patient piecing together of many seemingly distinct and
unrelated facts developed through a vast amount of research in widely separated fields.
We are accustomed to look for the gross and immediate effect and to ignore all else. Unless this
appears promptly and in such obvious form that it cannot be ignored, we deny the existence of
hazard. Even research men suffer from the handicap of inadequate methods of detecting the
beginnings of injury. The lack of sufficiently delicate methods to detect injury before symptoms
appear is one of the great unsolved problems in medicine.
‘But,’ someone will object, ‘I have used dieldrin sprays on the lawn many times but I have never
had convulsions like the World Health Organization spraymen—so it hasn’t harmed me.’ It is
not that simple. Despite the absence of sudden and dramatic symptoms, one who handles such
materials is unquestionably storing up toxic materials in his body. Storage of the chlorinated
hydrocarbons, as we have seen, is cumulative, beginning with the smallest intake. The toxic
materials become lodged in all the fatty tissues of the body. When these reserves of fat are
drawn upon, the poison may then strike quickly. A New Zealand medical journal recently
provided an example. A man under treatment for obesity suddenly developed symptoms of
poisoning. On examination his fat was found to contain stored dieldrin, which had been
metabolised as he lost weight. The same thing could happen with loss of weight in illness.
The results of storage, on the other hand, could be even less obvious. Several years ago the
Journal of the American Medical Association warned strongly of the hazards of insecticide
storage in adipose tissue, pointing out that drugs or chemicals that are cumulative require
greater caution than those having no tendency to be stored in the tissues. The adipose tissue,
we are warned, is not merely a place for the deposition of fat (which makes up about 18 per
cent of the body weight), but has many important functions with which the stored poisons may
interfere. Furthermore, fats are very widely distributed in the organs and tissues of the whole
body, even being constituents of cell membranes. It is important to remember, therefore, that
the fat-soluble insecticides become stored in individual cells, where they are in position to
interfere with the most vital and necessary functions of oxidation and energy production. This
important aspect of the problem will be taken up in the next chapter.
One of the most significant facts about the chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticides is their effect
on the liver. Of all organs in the body the liver is most extraordinary. In its versatility and in the
indispensable nature of its functions it has no equal. It presides over so many vital activities that
even the slightest damage to it is fraught with serious consequences. Not only does it provide
bile for the digestion of fats, but because of its location and the special circulatory pathways
that converge upon it, the liver receives blood directly from the digestive tract and is deeply

involved in the metabolism of all the principal foodstuffs. It stores sugar in the form of glycogen
and releases it as glucose in carefully measured quantities to keep the blood sugar at a normal
level. It builds body proteins, including some essential elements of blood plasma concerned
with blood-clotting. It maintains cholesterol at its proper level in the blood plasma, and
inactivates the male and female hormones when they reach excessive levels. It is a storehouse
of many vitamins, some of which in turn contribute to its own proper functioning.
Without a normally functioning liver the body would be disarmed—defenceless against the
great variety of poisons that continually invade it. Some of these are normal by-products of
metabolism, which the liver swiftly and efficiently makes harmless by withdrawing their
nitrogen. But poisons that have no normal place in the body may also be detoxified. The
‘harmless’ insecticides malathion and methoxychlor are less poisonous than their relatives only
because a liver enzyme deals with them, altering their molecules in such a way that their
capacity for harm is lessened. In similar ways the liver deals with the majority of the toxic
materials to which we are exposed.
Our line of defense against invading poisons or poisons from within is now weakened and
crumbling. A liver damaged by pesticides is not only incapable of protecting us from poisons,
the whole wide range of its activities may be interfered with. Not only are the consequences
far-reaching, but because of their variety and the fact that they may not immediately appear
they may not be attributed to their true cause. In connection with the nearly universal use of
insecticides that are liver poisons, it is interesting to note the sharp rise in hepatitis that began
during the 1950s and is continuing a fluctuating climb. Cirrhosis also is said to be increasing.
While it is admittedly difficult, in dealing with human beings rather than laboratory animals, to
‘prove’ that cause A produces effect B, plain common sense suggests that the relation between
a soaring rate of liver disease and the prevalence of liver poisons in the environment is no
coincidence. Whether or not the chlorinated hydrocarbons are the primary cause, it seems
hardly sensible under the circumstances to expose ourselves to poisons that have a proven
ability to damage the liver and so presumably to make it less resistant to disease.
Both major types of insecticides, the chlorinated hydrocarbons and the organic phosphates,
directly affect the nervous system, although in somewhat different ways. This has been made
clear by an infinite number of experiments on animals and by observations on human subjects
as well. As for DDT, the first of the new organic insecticides to be widely used, its action is
primarily on the central nervous system of man; the cerebellum and the higher motor cortex
are thought to be the areas chiefly affected. Abnormal sensations as of prickling, burning, or
itching, as well as tremors or even convulsions may follow exposure to appreciable amounts,
according to a standard textbook of toxicology.
Our first knowledge of the symptoms of acute poisoning by DDT was furnished by several
British investigators, who deliberately exposed themselves in order to learn the consequences.
Two scientists at the British Royal Navy Physiological Laboratory invited absorption of DDT
through the skin by direct contact with walls covered with a water soluble paint containing 2
per cent DDT, overlaid with a thin film of oil. The direct effect on the nervous system is
apparent in their eloquent description of their symptoms: ‘The tiredness, heaviness, and aching
of limbs were very real things, and the mental state was also most distressing...[there was]
extreme irritability...great distaste for work of any sort...a feeling of mental incompetence in
tackling the simplest mental task. The joint pains were quite violent at times.’

Another British experimenter who applied DDT in acetone solution to his skin reported
heaviness and aching of limbs, muscular weakness, and ‘spasms of extreme nervous tension’.
He took a holiday and improved, but on return to work his condition deteriorated. He then
spent three weeks in bed, made miserable by constant aching in limbs, insomnia, nervous
tension, and feelings of acute anxiety. On occasion tremors shook his whole body—tremors of
the sort now made all too familiar by the sight of birds poisoned by DDT. The experimenter lost
10 weeks from his work, and at the end of a year, when his case was reported in a British
medical journal, recovery was not complete. (Despite this evidence, several American
investigators conducting an experiment with DDT on volunteer subjects dismissed the
complaint of headache and ‘pain in every bone’ as ‘obviously of psychoneurotic origin’.)
There are now many cases on record in which both the symptoms and the whole course of the
illness point to insecticides as the cause. Typically, such a victim has had a known exposure to
one of the insecticides, his symptoms have subsided under treatment which included the
exclusion of all insecticides from his environment, and most significantly have returned with
each renewed contact with the offending chemicals. This sort of evidence—and no more—
forms the basis of a vast amount of medical therapy in many other disorders. There is no
reason why it should not serve as a warning that it is no longer sensible to take the ‘calculated
risk’ of saturating our environment with pesticides. Why does not everyone handling and using
insecticides develop the same symptoms? Here the matter of individual sensitivity enters in.
There is some evidence that women are more susceptible than men, the very young more than
adults, those who lead sedentary, indoor lives more than those leading a rugged life of work or
exercise in the open. Beyond these differences are others that are no less real because they are
intangible. What makes one person allergic to dust or pollen, sensitive to a poison, or
susceptible to an infection whereas another is not is a medical mystery for which there is at
present no explanation. The problem nevertheless exists and it affects significant numbers of
the population. Some physicians estimate that a third or more of their patients show signs of
some form of sensitivity, and that the number is growing. And unfortunately, sensitivity may
suddenly develop in a person previously insensitive. In fact, some medical men believe that
intermittent exposures to chemicals may produce just such sensitivity. If this is true, it may
explain why some studies on men subjected to continuous occupational exposure find little
evidence of toxic effects. By their constant contact with the chemicals these men keep
themselves desensitized—as an allergist keeps his patients desensitized by repeated small
injections of the allergen. The whole problem of pesticide poisoning is enormously complicated
by the fact that a human being, unlike a laboratory animal living under rigidly controlled
conditions, is never exposed to one chemical alone. Between the major groups of insecticides,
and between them and other chemicals, there are interactions that have serious potentials.
Whether released into soil or water or a man’s blood, these unrelated chemicals do not remain
segregated; there are mysterious and unseen changes by which one alters the power of
another for harm. There is interaction even between the two major groups of insecticides
usually thought to be completely distinct in their action. The power of the organic phosphates,
those poisoners of the nerve-protective enzyme cholinesterase, may become greater if the
body has first been exposed to a chlorinated hydrocarbon which injures the liver. This is
because, when liver function is disturbed, the cholinesterase level drops below normal. The
added depressive effect of the organic phosphate may then be enough to precipitate acute

symptoms. And as we have seen, pairs of the organic phosphates themselves may interact in
such a way as to increase their toxicity a hundredfold. Or the organic phosphates may interact
with various drugs, or with synthetic materials, food additives—who can say what else of the
infinite number of manmade substances that now pervade our world?
The effect of a chemical of supposedly innocuous nature can be drastically changed by the
action of another; one of the best examples is a close relative of DDT called methoxychlor.
(Actually, methoxychlor may not be as free from dangerous qualities as it is generally said to be,
for recent work on experimental animals shows a direct action on the uterus and a blocking
effect on some of the powerful pituitary hormones—reminding us again that these are
chemicals with enormous biologic effect. Other work shows that methoxychlor has a potential
ability to damage the kidneys.) Because it is not stored to any great extent when given alone,
we are told that methoxychlor is a safe chemical. But this is not necessarily true. If the liver has
been damaged by another agent, methoxychlor is stored in the body at 100 times its normal
rate, and will then imitate the effects of DDT with long-lasting effects on the nervous system.
Yet the liver damage that brings this about might be so slight as to pass unnoticed. It might
have been the result of any of a number of commonplace situations—using another insecticide,
using a cleaning fluid containing carbon tetrachloride, or taking one of the so-called
tranquilizing drugs, a number (but not all) of which are chlorinated hydrocarbons and possess
power to damage the liver.
Damage to the nervous system is not confined to acute poisoning; there may also be delayed
effects from exposure. Long-lasting damage to brain or nerves has been reported for
methoxychlor and others. Dieldrin, besides its immediate consequences, can have long delayed
effects ranging from ‘loss of memory, insomnia, and nightmares to mania’. Lindane, according
to medical findings, is stored in significant amounts in the brain and functioning liver tissue and
may induce ‘profound and long lasting effects on the central nervous system’. Yet this chemical,
a form of benzene hexachloride, is much used in vaporizers, devices that pour a stream of
volatilized insecticide vapor into homes, offices, restaurants. The organic phosphates, usually
considered only in relation to their more violent manifestations in acute poisoning, also have
the power to produce lasting physical damage to nerve tissues and, according to recent
findings, to induce mental disorders. Various cases of delayed paralysis have followed use of
one or another of these insecticides. A bizarre happening in the United States during the
prohibition era about 1930 was an omen of things to come. It was caused not by an insecticide
but by a substance belonging chemically to the same group as the organic phosphate
insecticides. During that period some medicinal substances were being pressed into service as
substitutes for liquor, being exempt from the prohibition law. One of these was Jamaica ginger.
But the United States Pharmacopeia product was expensive, and bootleggers conceived the
idea of making a substitute Jamaica ginger. They succeeded so well that their spurious product
responded to the appropriate chemical tests and deceived the government chemists. To give
their false ginger the necessary tang they had introduced a chemical known as triorthocresyl
phosphate. This chemical, like parathion and its relatives, destroys the protective enzyme
cholinesterase. As a consequence of drinking the bootleggers’ product some 15,000 people
developed a permanently crippling type of paralysis of the leg muscles, a condition now called
‘ginger paralysis’. The paralysis was accompanied by destruction of the nerve sheaths and by
degeneration of the cells of the anterior horns of the spinal cord.

About two decades later various other organic phosphates came into use as insecticides, as we
have seen, and soon cases reminiscent of the ginger paralysis episode began to occur. One was
a greenhouse worker in Germany who became paralyzed several months after experiencing
mild symptoms of poisoning on a few occasions after using parathion. Then a group of three
chemical plant workers developed acute poisoning from exposure to other insecticides of this
group. They recovered under treatment, but ten days later two of them developed muscular
weakness in the legs. This persisted for 10 months in one; the other, a young woman chemist,
was more severely affected, with paralysis in both legs and some involvement of the hands and
arms. Two years later when her case was reported in a medical journal she was still unable to
walk. The insecticide responsible for these cases has been withdrawn from the market, but
some of those now in use may be capable of like harm. Malathion (beloved of gardeners) has
induced severe muscular weakness in experiments on chickens. This was attended (as in ginger
paralysis) by destruction of the sheaths of the sciatic and spinal nerves. All these consequences
of organic phosphate poisoning, if survived, may be a prelude to worse. In view of the severe
damage they inflict upon the nervous system, it was perhaps inevitable that these insecticides
would eventually be linked with mental disease. That link has recently been supplied by
investigators at the University of Melbourne and Prince Henry’s Hospital in Melbourne, who
reported on 16 cases of mental disease. All had a history of prolonged exposure to organic
phosphorus insecticides. Three were scientists checking the efficacy of sprays; 8 worked in
greenhouses; 5 were farm workers. Their symptoms ranged from impairment of memory to
schizophrenic and depressive reactions. All had normal medical histories before the chemicals
they were using boomeranged and struck them down.
Echoes of this sort of thing are to be found, as we have seen, widely scattered throughout
medical literature, sometimes involving the chlorinated hydrocarbons, sometimes the organic
phosphates. Confusion, delusions, loss of memory, mania—a heavy price to pay for the
temporary destruction of a few insects, but a price that will continue to be exacted as long as
we insist upon using chemicals that strike directly at the nervous system.

13. Through a Narrow Window
THE BIOLOGIST George Wald once compared his work on an exceedingly specialized
subject, the visual pigments of the eye, to ‘a very narrow window through which at a distance
one can see only a crack of light. As one comes closer the view grows wider and wider, until
finally through this same narrow window one is looking at the universe.’ So it is that only when
we bring our focus to bear, first on the individual cells of the body, then on the minute
structures within the cells, and finally on the ultimate reactions of molecules within these
structures—only when we do this can we comprehend the most serious and far-reaching
effects of the haphazard introduction of foreign chemicals into our internal environment.
Medical research has only rather recently turned to the functioning of the individual cell in
producing the energy that is the indispensable quality of life. The extraordinary energyproducing mechanism of the body is basic not only to health but to life; it transcends in
importance even the most vital organs, for without the smooth and effective functioning of
energy-yielding oxidation none of the body’s functions can be performed. Yet the nature of
many of the chemicals used against insects, rodents, and weeds is such that they may strike
directly at this system, disrupting its beautifully functioning mechanism.
The research that led to our present understanding of cellular oxidation is one of the most
impressive accomplishments in all biology and biochemistry. The roster of contributors to this
work includes many Nobel Prize winners. Step by step it has been going on for a quarter of a
century, drawing on even earlier work for some of its foundation stones. Even yet it is not
complete in all details. And only within the past decade have all the varied pieces of research
come to form a whole so that biological oxidation could become part of the common
knowledge of biologists. Even more important is the fact that medical men who received their
basic training before 1950 have had little opportunity to realize the critical importance of the
process and the hazards of disrupting it.
The ultimate work of energy production is accomplished not in any specialized organ but in
every cell of the body. A living cell, like a flame, burns fuel to produce the energy on which life
depends. The analogy is more poetic than precise, for the cell accomplishes its ‘burning’ with
only the moderate heat of the body’s normal temperature. Yet all these billions of gently
burning little fires spark the energy of life. Should they cease to burn, ‘no heart could beat, no
plant could grow upward defying gravity, no amoeba could swim, no sensation could speed
along a nerve, no thought could flash in the human brain,’ said the chemist Eugene
Rabinowitch.
The transformation of matter into energy in the cell is an ever-flowing process, one of nature’s
cycles of renewal, like a wheel endlessly turning. Grain by grain, molecule by molecule,
carbohydrate fuel in the form of glucose is fed into this wheel; in its cyclic passage the fuel
molecule undergoes fragmentation and a series of minute chemical changes. The changes are
made in orderly fashion, step by step, each step directed and controlled by an enzyme of so
specialized a function that it does this one thing and nothing else. At each step energy is
produced, waste products (carbon dioxide and water) are given off, and the altered molecule of
fuel is passed on to the next stage. When the turning wheel comes full cycle the fuel molecule

has been stripped down to a form in which it is ready to combine with a new molecule coming
in and to start the cycle anew.
This process by which the cell functions as a chemical factory is one of the wonders of the living
world. The fact that all the functioning parts are of infinitesimal size adds to the miracle. With
few exceptions cells themselves are minute, seen only with the aid of a microscope. Yet the
greater part of the work of oxidation is performed in a theater far smaller, in tiny granules
within the cell called mitochondria. Although known for more than 60 years, these were
formerly dismissed as cellular elements of unknown and probably unimportant function. Only
in the 1950s did their study become an exciting and fruitful field of research; suddenly they
began to engage so much attention that 1000 papers on this subject alone appeared within a
five-year period. Again one stands in awe at the marvelous ingenuity and patience by which the
mystery of the mitochondria has been solved. Imagine a particle so small that you can barely
see it even though a microscope has enlarged it for you 300 times. Then imagine the skill
required to isolate this particle, to take it apart and analyze its components and determine their
highly complex functioning. Yet this has been done with the aid of the electron microscope and
the techniques of the biochemist.
It is now known that the mitochondria are tiny packets of enzymes, a varied assortment
including all the enzymes necessary for the oxidative cycle, arranged in precise and orderly
array on walls and partitions. The mitochondria are the ‘powerhouses’ in which most of the
energy-producing reactions occur. After the first, preliminary steps of oxidation have been
performed in the cytoplasm the fuel molecule is taken into the mitochondria. It is here that
oxidation is completed; it is here that enormous amounts of energy are released. The endlessly
turning wheels of oxidation within the mitochondria would turn to little purpose if it were not
for this all-important result. The energy produced at each stage of the oxidative cycle is in a
form familiarly spoken of by the biochemists as ATP (adenosine triphosphate), a molecule
containing three phosphate groups. The role of ATP in furnishing energy comes from the fact
that it can transfer one of its phosphate groups to other substances, along with the energy of
its bonds of electrons shuttling back and forth at high speed. Thus, in a muscle cell, energy to
contract is gained when a terminal phosphate group is transferred to the contracting muscle. So
another cycle takes place—a cycle within a cycle: a molecule of ATP gives up one of its
phosphate groups and retains only two, becoming a diphosphate molecule, ADP. But as the
wheel turns further another phosphate group is coupled on and the potent ATP is restored. The
analogy of the storage battery has been used: ATP represents the charged, ADP the discharged
battery.
ATP is the universal currency of energy—found in all organisms from microbes to man. It
furnishes mechanical energy to muscle cells; electrical energy to nerve cells. The sperm cell, the
fertilized egg ready for the enormous burst of activity that will transform it into a frog or a bird
or a human infant, the cell that must create a hormone, all are supplied with ATP. Some of the
energy of ATP is used in the mitochondrion but most of it is immediately dispatched into the
cell to provide power for other activities. The location of the mitochondria within certain cells is
eloquent of their function, since they are placed so that energy can be delivered precisely
where it is needed. In muscle cells they cluster around contracting fibers; in nerve cells they are
found at the junction with another cell, supplying energy for the transfer of impulses; in sperm
cells they are concentrated at the point where the propellant tail is joined to the head.

The charging of the battery, in which ADP and a free phosphate group are combined to restore
ATP, is coupled to the oxidative process; the close linking is known as coupled phosphorylation.
If the combination becomes uncoupled, the means is lost for providing usable energy.
Respiration continues but no energy is produced. The cell has become like a racing engine,
generating heat but yielding no power. Then the muscle cannot contract, nor can the impulse
race along the nerve pathways. Then the sperm cannot move to its destination; the fertilized
egg cannot carry to completion its complex divisions and elaborations. The consequences of
uncoupling could indeed be disastrous for any organism from embryo to adult: in time it could
lead to the death of the tissue or even of the organism. How can uncoupling be brought about?
Radiation is an uncoupler, and the death of cells exposed to radiation is thought by some to be
brought about in this way. Unfortunately, a good many chemicals also have the power to
separate oxidation from energy production, and the insecticides and weed killers are well
represented on the list. The phenols, as we have seen, have a strong effect on metabolism,
causing a potentially fatal rise in temperature; this is brought about by the ‘racing engine’ effect
of uncoupling. The dinitrophenols and pentachlorophenols are examples of this group that have
widespread use as herbicides. Another uncoupler among the herbicides is 2,4-D. Of the
chlorinated hydrocarbons, DDT is a proven uncoupler and further study will probably reveal
others among this group. But uncoupling is not the only way to extinguish the little fires in
some or all of the body’s billions of cells. We have seen that each step in oxidation is directed
and expedited by a specific enzyme. When any of these enzymes—even a single one of them—
is destroyed or weakened, the cycle of oxidation within the cell comes to a halt. It makes no
difference which enzyme is affected. Oxidation progresses in a cycle like a turning wheel. If we
thrust a crowbar between the spokes of a wheel it makes no difference where we do it, the
wheel stops turning. In the same way, if we destroy an enzyme that functions at any point in
the cycle, oxidation ceases. There is then no further energy production, so the end effect is very
similar to uncoupling.
The crowbar to wreck the wheels of oxidation can be supplied by any of a number of chemicals
commonly used as pesticides. DDT, methoxychlor, malathion, phenothiazine, and various
dinitro compounds are among the numerous pesticides that have been found to inhibit one or
more of the enzymes concerned in the cycle of oxidation. They thus appear as agents
potentially capable of blocking the whole process of energy production and depriving the cells
of utilizable oxygen. This is an injury with most disastrous consequences, only a few of which
can be mentioned here. Merely by systematically withholding oxygen, experimenters have
caused normal cells to turn into cancer cells, as we shall see in the following chapter. Some hint
of other drastic consequences of depriving a cell of oxygen can be seen in animal experiments
on developing embryos. With insufficient oxygen the orderly processes by which the tissues
unfold and the organs develop are disrupted; malformations and other abnormalities then
occur. Presumably the human embryo deprived of oxygen may also develop congenital
deformities.
There are signs that an increase in such disasters is being noticed, even though few look far
enough to find all of the causes. In one of the more unpleasant portents of the times, the Office
of Vital Statistics in 1961 initiated a national tabulation of malformations at birth, with the
explanatory comment that the resulting statistics would provide needed facts on the incidence
of congenital malformations and the circumstances under which they occur. Such studies will

no doubt be directed largely toward measuring the effects of radiation, but it must not be
overlooked that many chemicals are the partners of radiation, producing precisely the same
effects. Some of the defects and malformations in tomorrow’s children, grimly anticipated by
the Office of Vital Statistics, will almost certainly be caused by these chemicals that permeate
our outer and inner worlds. It may well be that some of the findings about diminished
reproduction are also linked with interference with biological oxidation, and consequent
depletion of the all-important storage batteries of ATP. The egg, even before fertilization, needs
to be generously supplied with ATP, ready and waiting for the enormous effort, the vast
expenditure of energy that will be required once the sperm has entered and fertilization has
occurred. Whether the sperm cell will reach and penetrate the egg depends upon its own
supply of ATP, generated in the mitochondria thickly clustered in the neck of the cell. Once
fertilization is accomplished and cell division has begun, the supply of energy in the form of ATP
will largely determine whether the development of the embryo will proceed to completion.
Embryologists studying some of their most convenient subjects, the eggs of frogs and of sea
urchins, have found that if the ATP content is reduced below a certain critical level the egg
simply stops dividing and soon dies.
It is not an impossible step from the embryology laboratory to the apple tree where a robin’s
nest holds its complement of blue-green eggs; but the eggs lie cold, the fires of life that
flickered for a few days now extinguished. Or to the top of a tall Florida pine where a vast pile
of twigs and sticks in ordered disorder holds three large white eggs, cold and lifeless. Why did
the robins and the eaglets not hatch? Did the eggs of the birds, like those of the laboratory
frogs, stop developing simply because they lacked enough of the common currency of energy—
the ATP molecules—to complete their development? And was the lack of ATP brought about
because in the body of the parent birds and in the eggs there were stored enough insecticides
to stop the little turning wheels of oxidation on which the supply of energy depends? It is no
longer necessary to guess about the storage of insecticides in the eggs of birds, which obviously
lend themselves to this kind of observation more readily than the mammalian ovum. Large
residues of DDT and other hydrocarbons have been found whenever looked for in the eggs of
birds subjected to these chemicals, either experimentally or in the wild. And the concentrations
have been heavy. Pheasant eggs in a California experiment contained up to 349 parts per
million of DDT. In Michigan, eggs taken from the oviducts of robins dead of DDT poisoning
showed concentrations up to 200 parts per million. Other eggs were taken from nests left
unattended as parent robins were stricken with poison; these too contained DDT. Chickens
poisoned by aldrin used on a neighboring farm have passed on the chemical to their eggs; hens
experimentally fed DDT laid eggs containing as much as 65 parts per million.
Knowing that DDT and other (perhaps all) chlorinated hydrocarbons stop the energy-producing
cycle by inactivating a specific enzyme or uncoupling the energy-producing mechanism, it is
hard to see how any egg so loaded with residues could complete the complex process of
development: the infinite number of cell divisions, the elaboration of tissues and organs, the
synthesis of vital substances that in the end produce a living creature. All this requires vast
amounts of energy—the little packets of ATP which the turning of the metabolic wheel alone
can produce. There is no reason to suppose these disastrous events are confined to birds. ATP
is the universal currency of energy, and the metabolic cycles that produce it turn to the same

purpose in birds and bacteria, in men and mice. The fact of insecticide storage in the germ cells
of any species should therefore disturb us, suggesting comparable effects in human beings.
And there are indications that these chemicals lodge in tissues concerned with the manufacture
of germ cells as well as in the cells themselves. Accumulations of insecticides have been
discovered in the sex organs of a variety of birds and mammals—in pheasants, mice, and guinea
pigs under controlled conditions, in robins in an area sprayed for elm disease, and in deer
roaming western forests sprayed for spruce budworm. In one of the robins the concentration of
DDT in the testes was heavier than in any other part of the body. Pheasants also accumulated
extraordinary amounts in the testes, up to 1500 parts per million. Probably as an effect of such
storage in the sex organs, atrophy of the testes has been observed in experimental mammals.
Young rats exposed to methoxychlor had extraordinarily small testes. When young roosters
were fed DDT, the testes made only 18 per cent of their normal growth; combs and wattles,
dependent for their development upon the testicular hormone, were only a third the normal
size. The spermatozoa themselves may well be affected by loss of ATP. Experiments show that
the motility of bull sperm is decreased by dinitrophenol, which interferes with the energycoupling mechanism with inevitable loss of energy. The same effect would probably be found
with other chemicals were the matter investigated. Some indication of the possible effect on
human beings is seen in medical reports of oligospermia, or reduced production of
spermatozoa, among aviation crop dusters applying DDT. . . .
For mankind as a whole, a possession infinitely more valuable than individual life is our genetic
heritage, our link with past and future. Shaped through long eons of evolution, our genes not
only make us what we are, but hold in their minute beings the future—be it one of promise or
threat. Yet genetic deterioration through man-made agents is the menace of our time, ‘the last
and greatest danger to our civilization’. Again the parallel between chemicals and radiation is
exact and inescapable. The living cell assaulted by radiation suffers a variety of injuries: its
ability to divide normally may be destroyed, it may suffer changes in chromosome structure, or
the genes, carriers of hereditary material, may undergo those sudden changes known as
mutations, which cause them to produce new characteristics in succeeding generations. If
especially susceptible the cell may be killed outright, or finally, after the passage of time
measured in years, it may become malignant.
All these consequences of radiation have been duplicated in laboratory studies by a large group
of chemicals known as radiomimetic or radiation-imitating. Many chemicals used as
pesticides—herbicides as well as insecticides—belong to this group of substances that have the
ability to damage the chromosomes, interfere with normal cell division, or cause mutations.
These injuries to the genetic material are of a kind that may lead to disease in the individual
exposed or they may make their effects felt in future generations. Only a few decades ago, no
one knew these effects of either radiation or chemicals. In those days the atom had not been
split and few of the chemicals that were to duplicate radiation had as yet been conceived in the
test tubes of chemists. Then in 1927, a professor of zoology in a Texas university, Dr. H. J.
Muller, found that by exposing an organism to X-radiation, he could produce mutations in
succeeding generations. With Muller’s discovery a vast new field of scientific and medical
knowledge was opened up. Muller later received the Nobel Prize in Medicine for his
achievement, and in a world that soon gained unhappy familiarity with the gray rains of fallout,
even the nonscientist now knows the potential results of radiation.

Although far less noticed, a companion discovery was made by Charlotte Auerbach and William
Robson at the University of Edinburgh in the early 1940s. Working with mustard gas, they found
that this chemical produces permanent chromosome abnormalities that cannot be
distinguished from those induced by radiation. Tested on the fruit fly, the same organism
Muller had used in his original work with X-rays, mustard gas also produced mutations. Thus
the first chemical mutagen was discovered. Mustard gas as a mutagen has now been joined by
a long list of other chemicals known to alter genetic material in plants and animals. To
understand how chemicals can alter the course of heredity, we must first watch the basic
drama of life as it is played on the stage of the living cell. The cells composing the tissues and
organs of the body must have the power to increase in number if the body is to grow and if the
stream of life is to be kept flowing from generation to generation. This is accomplished by the
process of mitosis, or nuclear division. In a cell that is about to divide, changes of the utmost
importance occur, first within the nucleus, but eventually involving the entire cell. Within the
nucleus, the chromosomes mysteriously move and divide, ranging themselves in age-old
patterns that will serve to distribute the determiners of heredity, the genes, to the daughter
cells. First they assume the form of elongated threads, on which the genes are aligned, like
beads on a string. Then each chromosome divides lengthwise (the genes dividing also). When
the cell divides into two, half of each goes to each of the daughter cells. In this way each new
cell will contain a complete set of chromosomes, and all the genetic information encoded
within them. In this way the integrity of the race and of the species is preserved; in this way like
begets like.
A special kind of cell division occurs in the formation of the germ cells. Because the
chromosome number for a given species is constant, the egg and the sperm, which are to unite
to form a new individual, must carry to their union only half the species number. This is
accomplished with extraordinary precision by a change in the behavior of the chromosomes
that occurs at one of the divisions producing those cells. At this time the chromosomes do not
split, but one whole chromosome of each pair goes into each daughter cell.
In this elemental drama all life is revealed as one. The events of the process of cell division are
common to all earthly life; neither man nor amoeba, the giant sequoia nor the simple yeast cell
can long exist without carrying on this process of cell division. Anything that disturbs mitosis is
therefore a grave threat to the welfare of the organism affected and to its descendants.
‘The major features of cellular organization, including, for instance, mitosis, must be much older
than 500 million years—more nearly 1000 million,’ wrote George Gaylord Simpson and his
colleagues Pittendrigh and Tiffany in their broadly encompassing book entitled Life. ‘In this
sense the world of life, while surely fragile and complex, is incredibly durable through time—
more durable than mountains. This durability is wholly dependent on the almost incredible
accuracy with which the inherited information is copied from generation to generation.’
But in all the thousand million years envisioned by these authors no threat has struck so
directly and so forcefully at that ‘incredible accuracy’ as the mid-20th century threat of manmade radiation and man-made and man-disseminated chemicals. Sir Macfarlane Burnet, a
distinguished Australian physician and a Nobel Prize winner, considers it ‘one of the most
significant medical features’ of our time that, ‘as a by-product of more and more powerful
therapeutic procedures and the production of chemical substances outside of biological

experiences, the normal protective barriers that kept mutagenic agents from the internal
organs have been more and more frequently penetrated.’
The study of human chromosomes is in its infancy, and so it has only recently become possible
to study the effect of environmental factors upon them. It was not until 1956 that new
techniques made it possible to determine accurately the number of chromosomes in the
human cell—46—and to observe them in such detail that the presence or absence of whole
chromosomes or even parts of chromosomes could be detected. The whole concept of genetic
damage by something in the environment is also relatively new, and is little understood except
by the geneticists, whose advice is too seldom sought. The hazard from radiation in its various
forms is now reasonably well understood—although still denied in surprising places. Dr. Muller
has frequently had occasion to deplore the ‘resistance to the acceptance of genetic principles
on the part of so many, not only of governmental appointees in the policy-making positions,
but also of so many of the medical profession.’ The fact that chemicals may play a role similar
to radiation has scarcely dawned on the public mind, nor on the minds of most medical or
scientific workers. For this reason the role of chemicals in general use (rather than in laboratory
experiments) has not yet been assessed. It is extremely important that this be done.
Sir Macfarlane is not alone in his estimate of the potential danger. Dr. Peter Alexander, an
outstanding British authority, has said that the radiomimetic chemicals ‘may well represent a
greater danger’ than radiation. Dr. Muller, with the perspective gained by decades of
distinguished work in genetics, warns that various chemicals (including groups represented by
pesticides) ‘can raise the mutation frequency as much as radiation...As yet far too little is
known of the extent to which our genes, under modern conditions of exposure to unusual
chemicals, are being subjected to such mutagenic influences.’
The widespread neglect of the problem of chemical mutagens is perhaps due to the fact that
those first discovered were of scientific interest only. Nitrogen mustard, after all, is not sprayed
upon whole populations from the air; its use is in the hands of experimental biologists or of
physicians who use it in cancer therapy. (A case of chromosome damage in a patient receiving
such therapy has recently been reported.) But insecticides and weed killers are brought into
intimate contact with large numbers of people. Despite the scant attention that has been given
to the matter, it is possible to assemble specific information on a number of these pesticides,
showing that they disturb the cell’s vital processes in ways ranging from slight chromosome
damage to gene mutation, and with consequences extending to the ultimate disaster of
malignancy. Mosquitoes exposed to DDT for several generations turned into strange creatures
called gynandromorphs—part male and part female.
Plants treated with various phenols suffered profound destruction of chromosomes, changes in
genes, a striking number of mutations, ‘irreversible hereditary changes’. Mutations also
occurred in fruit flies, the classic subject of genetics experiments, when subjected to phenol;
these flies developed mutations so damaging as to be fatal on exposure to one of the common
herbicides or to urethane. Urethane belongs to the group of chemicals called carbamates, from
which an increasing number of insecticides and other agricultural chemicals are drawn. Two of
the carbamates are actually used to prevent sprouting of potatoes in storage—precisely
because of their proven effect in stopping cell division. Another antisprouting agent, maleic
hydrazide, is rated a powerful mutagen. Plants treated with benzene hexachloride (BHC) or

lindane became monstrously deformed with tumorlike swellings on their roots. Their cells grew
in size, being swollen with chromosomes which doubled in number. The doubling continued
in future divisions until further cell division became mechanically impossible. The herbicide 2,4D has also produced tumorlike swellings in treated plants. Chromosomes become short, thick,
clumped together. Cell division is seriously retarded. The general effect is said to parallel closely
that produced by Xrays.
These are but a few illustrations; many more could be cited. As yet there has been no
comprehensive study aimed at testing the mutagenic effects of pesticides as such. The facts
cited above are by-products of research in cell physiology or genetics. What is urgently needed
is a direct attack on the problem. Some scientists who are willing to concede the potent effect
of environmental radiation on man nevertheless question whether mutagenic chemicals can, as
a practical proposition, have the same effect. They cite the great penetrating power of
radiation, but doubt that chemicals could reach the germ cells. Once again we are hampered by
the fact that there has been little direct investigation of the problem in man. However, the
finding of large residues of DDT in the gonads and germ cells of birds and mammals is strong
evidence that the chlorinated hydrocarbons, at least, not only become widely distributed
throughout the body but come into contact with genetic materials. Professor David E. Davis at
Pennsylvania State University has recently discovered that a potent chemical which prevents
cells from dividing and has had limited use in cancer therapy can also be used to cause sterility
in birds. Sublethal levels of the chemical halt cell division in the gonads. Professor Davis has had
some success in field trials. Obviously, then, there is little basis for the hope or belief that the
gonads of any organism are shielded from chemicals in the environment.
Recent medical findings in the field of chromosome abnormalities are of extreme interest and
significance. In 1959 several British and French research teams found their independent studies
pointing to a common conclusion—that some of humanity’s ills are caused by a disturbance of
the normal chromosome number. In certain diseases and abnormalities studied by these
investigators the number differed from the normal. To illustrate: it is now known that all typical
mongoloids have one extra chromosome. Occasionally this is attached to another so that the
chromosome number remains the normal 46. As a rule, however, the extra is a separate
chromosome, making the number 47. In such individuals, the original cause of the defect must
have occurred in the generation preceding its appearance. A different mechanism seems to
operate in a number of patients, both in America and Great Britain, who are suffering from a
chronic form of leukemia. These have been found to have a consistent chromosome
abnormality in some of the blood cells. The abnormality consists of the loss of part of a
chromosome. In these patients the skin cells have a normal complement of chromosomes. This
indicates that the chromosome defect did not occur in the germ cells that gave rise to these
individuals, but represents damage to particular cells (in this case, the precursors of blood cells)
that occurred during the life of the individual. The loss of part of a chromosome has perhaps
deprived these cells of their ‘instructions’ for normal behavior.
The list of defects linked to chromosome disturbances has grown with surprising speed since
the opening of this territory, hitherto beyond the boundaries of medical research. One, known
only as Klinefelter’s syndrome, involves a duplication of one of the sex chromosomes. The
resulting individual is a male, but because he carries two of the X chromosomes (becoming XXY
instead of XY, the normal male complement) he is somewhat abnormal. Excessive height and

mental defects often accompany the sterility caused by this condition. In contrast, an individual
who receives only one sex chromosome (becoming XO instead of either XX or XY) is actually
female but lacks many of the secondary sexual characteristics. The condition is accompanied by
various physical (and sometimes mental) defects, for of course the X chromosome carries genes
for a variety of characteristics. This is known as Turner’s syndrome. Both conditions had been
described in medical literature long before the cause was known.
An immense amount of work on the subject of chromosome abnormalities is being done by
workers in many countries. A group at the University of Wisconsin, headed by Dr. Klaus Patau,
has been concentrating on a variety of congenital abnormalities, usually including mental
retardation, that seem to result from the duplication of only part of a chromosome, as if
somewhere in the formation of one of the germ cells a chromosome had broken and the pieces
had not been properly redistributed. Such a mishap is likely to interfere with the normal
development of the embryo. According to present knowledge, the occurrence of an entire extra
body chromosome is usually lethal, preventing survival of the embryo. Only three such
conditions are known to be viable; one of them, of course, is mongolism. The presence of an
extra attached fragment, on the other hand, although seriously damaging is not necessarily
fatal, and according to the Wisconsin investigators this situation may well account for a
substantial part of the so far unexplained cases in which a child is born with multiple defects,
usually including mental retardation. This is so new a field of study that as yet scientists have
been more concerned with identifying the chromosome abnormalities associated with disease
and defective development than with speculating about the causes. It would be foolish to
assume that any single agent is responsible for damaging the chromosomes or causing their
erratic behavior during cell division. But can we afford to ignore the fact that we are now filling
the environment with chemicals that have the power to strike directly at the chromosomes,
affecting them in the precise ways that could cause such conditions? Is this not too high a price
to pay for a sproutless potato or a mosquitoless patio? We can, if we wish, reduce this threat to
our genetic heritage, a possession that has come down to us through some two billion years of
evolution and selection of living protoplasm, a possession that is ours for the moment only,
until we must pass it on to generations to come. We are doing little now to preserve its
integrity. Although chemical manufacturers are required by law to test their materials for
toxicity, they are not required to make the tests that would reliably demonstrate genetic effect,
and they do not do so.

14. One in Every Four
THE BATTLE of living things against cancer began so long ago that its origin is lost in
time. But it must have begun in a natural environment, in which whatever life inhabited the
earth was subjected, for good or ill, to influences that had their origin in sun and storm and the
ancient nature of the earth. Some of the elements of this environment created hazards to
which life had to adjust or perish. The ultraviolet radiation in sunlight could cause malignancy.
So could radiations from certain rocks, or arsenic washed out of soil or rocks to contaminate
food or water supplies. The environment contained these hostile elements even before there
was life; yet life arose, and over the millions of years it came to exist in infinite numbers and
endless variety. Over the eons of unhurried time that is nature’s, life reached an adjustment
with destructive forces as selection weeded out the less adaptable and only the most resistant
survived. These natural cancer-causing agents are still a factor in producing malignancy;
however, they are few in number and they belong to that ancient array of forces to which life
has been accustomed from the beginning.
With the advent of man the situation began to change, for man, alone of all forms of life, can
create cancer-producing substances, which in medical terminology are called carcinogens. A
few man-made carcinogens have been part of the environment for centuries. An example is
soot, containing aromatic hydrocarbons. With the dawn of the industrial era the world became
a place of continuous, ever-accelerating change. Instead of the natural environment there was
rapidly substituted an artificial one composed of new chemical and physical agents, many of
them possessing powerful capacities for inducing biologic change. Against these carcinogens
which his own activities had created man had no protection, for even as his biological heritage
has evolved slowly, so it adapts slowly to new conditions. As a result these powerful substances
could easily penetrate the inadequate defenses of the body.
The history of cancer is long, but our recognition of the agents that produce it has been slow to
mature. The first awareness that external or environmental agents could produce malignant
change dawned in the mind of a London physician nearly two centuries ago. In 1775 Sir
Percivall Pott declared that the scrotal cancer so common among chimney sweeps must be
caused by the soot that accumulated on their bodies. He could not furnish the ‘proof’ we would
demand today, but modern research methods have now isolated the deadly chemical in soot
and proved the correctness of his perception. For a century or more after Pott’s discovery there
seems to have been little further realization that certain of the chemicals in the human
environment could cause cancer by repeated skin contact, inhalation, or swallowing. True, it
had been noticed that skin cancer was prevalent among workers exposed to arsenic fumes in
copper smelters and tin foundries in Cornwall and Wales. And it was realized that workers in
the cobalt mines in Saxony and in the uranium mines at Joachimsthal in Bohemia were subject
to a disease of the lungs, later identified as cancer. But these were phenomena of the preindustrial era, before the flowering of the industries whose products were to pervade the
environment of almost every living thing.
The first recognition of malignancies traceable to the age of industry came during the last
quarter of the 19th century. About the time that Pasteur was demonstrating the microbial
origin of many infectious diseases, others were discovering the chemical origin of cancer skin

cancers among workers in the new lignite industry in Saxony and in the Scottish shale industry,
along with other cancers caused by occupational exposure to tar and pitch. By the end of the
19th century a half-dozen sources of industrial carcinogens were known; the 20th century was
to create countless new cancer-causing chemicals and to bring the general population into
intimate contact with them. In the less than two centuries intervening since the work of Pott,
the environmental situation has been vastly changed. No longer are exposures to dangerous
chemicals occupational alone; they have entered the environment of everyone—even of
children as yet unborn. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that we are now aware of an alarming
increase in malignant disease.
The increase itself is no mere matter of subjective impressions. The monthly report of the
Office of Vital Statistics for July 1959 states that malignant growths, including those of the
lymphatic and blood-forming tissues, accounted for 15 per cent of the deaths in 1958
compared with only 4 per cent in 1900. Judging by the present incidence of the disease, the
American Cancer Society estimates that 45,000,000 Americans now living will eventually
develop cancer. This means that malignant disease will strike two out of three families. The
situation with respect to children is even more deeply disturbing. A quarter century ago, cancer
in children was considered a medical rarity. Today, more American school children die of cancer
than from any other disease. So serious has this situation become that Boston has established
the first hospital in the United States devoted exclusively to the treatment of children with
cancer. Twelve per cent of all deaths in children between the ages of one and fourteen are
caused by cancer. Large numbers of malignant tumors are discovered clinically in children
under the age of five, but it is an even grimmer fact that significant numbers of such growths
are present at or before birth. Dr. W. C. Hueper of the National Cancer Institute, a foremost
authority on environmental cancer, has suggested that congenital cancers and cancers in
infants may be related to the action of cancer-producing agents to which the mother has been
exposed during pregnancy and which penetrate the placenta to act on the rapidly developing
fetal tissues. Experiments show that the younger the animal is when it is subjected to a cancerproducing agent the more certain is the production of cancer. Dr. Francis Ray of the University
of Florida has warned that ‘we may be initiating cancer in the children of today by the addition
of chemicals [to food]...We will not know, perhaps for a generation or two, what the effects will
be.’ . . .
The problem that concerns us here is whether any of the chemicals we are using in our
attempts to control nature play a direct or indirect role as causes of cancer. In terms of
evidence gained from animal experiments we shall see that five or possibly six of the pesticides
must definitely be rated as carcinogens. The list is greatly lengthened if we add those
considered by some physicians to cause leukemia in human patients. Here the evidence is
circumstantial, as it must be since we do not experiment on human beings, but it is nonetheless
impressive. Still other pesticides will be added as we include those whose action on living
tissues or cells may be considered an indirect cause of malignancy. One of the earliest
pesticides associated with cancer is arsenic, occurring in sodium arsenite as a weed killer, and in
calcium arsenate and various other compounds as insecticides. The association between arsenic
and cancer in man and animals is historic. A fascinating example of the consequences of
exposure to arsenic is related by Dr. Hueper in his Occupational Tumors, a classic monograph
on the subject. The city of Reichenstein in Silesia had been for almost a thousand years the site

of mining for gold and silver ores, and for several hundred years for arsenic ores. Over the
centuries arsenic wastes accumulated in the vicinity of the mine shafts and were picked up by
streams coming down from the mountains. The underground water also became contaminated,
and arsenic entered the drinking water. For centuries many of the inhabitants of this region
suffered from what came to be known as ‘the Reichenstein disease’—chronic arsenicism with
accompanying disorders of the liver, skin, and gastrointestinal and nervous systems. Malignant
tumors were a common accompaniment of the disease. Reichenstein’s disease is now chiefly of
historic interest, for new water supplies were provided a quarter of a century ago, from which
arsenic was largely eliminated. In Córdoba Province in Argentina, however, chronic arsenic
poisoning, accompanied by arsenical skin cancers, is endemic because of the contamination of
drinking water derived from rock formations containing arsenic.
It would not be difficult to create conditions similar to those in Reichenstein and Córdoba by
long continued use of arsenical insecticides. In the United States the arsenic-drenched soils of
tobacco plantations, of many orchards in the Northwest, and of blueberry lands in the East may
easily lead to pollution of water supplies. An arsenic-contaminated environment affects not
only man but animals as well. A report of great interest came from Germany in 1936. In the
area about Freiberg, Saxony, smelters for silver and lead poured arsenic fumes into the air, to
drift out over the surrounding countryside and settle down upon the vegetation. According to
Dr. Hueper, horses, cows, goats, and pigs, which of course fed on this vegetation, showed loss
of hair and thickening of the skin. Deer inhabiting nearby forests sometimes had abnormal
pigment spots and precancerous warts. One had a definitely cancerous lesion. Both domestic
and wild animals were affected by ‘arsenical enteritis, gastric ulcers, and cirrhosis of the liver.’
Sheep kept near the smelters developed cancers of the nasal sinus; at their death arsenic was
found in the brain, liver, and tumors. In the area there was also ‘an extraordinary mortality
among insects, especially bees. After rainfalls which washed the arsenical dust from the leaves
and carried it along into the water of brooks and pools, a great many fish died.’ . . .
An example of a carcinogen belonging to the group of new, organic pesticides is a chemical
widely used against mites and ticks. Its history provides abundant proof that, despite the
supposed safeguards provided by legislation, the public can be exposed to a known carcinogen
for several years before the slowly moving legal processes can bring the situation under control.
The story is interesting from another standpoint, proving that what the public is asked to accept
as ‘safe’ today may turn out tomorrow to be extremely dangerous. When this chemical was
introduced in 1955, the manufacturer applied for a tolerance which would sanction the
presence of small residues on any crops that might be sprayed. As required by law, he had
tested the chemical on laboratory animals and submitted the results with his application.
However, scientists of the Food and Drug Administration interpreted the tests as showing a
possible cancer-producing tendency and the Commissioner accordingly recommended a ‘zero
tolerance’, which is a way of saying that no residues could legally occur on food shipped across
state lines. But the manufacturer had the legal right to appeal and the case was accordingly
reviewed by a committee. The committee’s decision was a compromise: a tolerance of 1 part
per million was to be established and the product marketed for two years, during which time
further laboratory tests were to determine whether the chemical was actually a carcinogen.
Although the committee did not say so, its decision meant that the public was to act as guinea
pigs, testing the suspected carcinogen along with the laboratory dogs and rats. But laboratory

animals give more prompt results, and after the two years it was evident that this miticide was
indeed a carcinogen. Even at that point, in 1957, the Food and Drug Administration could not
instantly rescind the tolerance which allowed residues of a known carcinogen to contaminate
food consumed by the public. Another year was required for various legal procedures. Finally,
in December 1958 the zero tolerance which the Commissioner had recommended in 1955
became effective. These are by no means the only known carcinogens among pesticides. In
laboratory tests on animal subjects, DDT has produced suspicious liver tumors. Scientists of the
Food and Drug Administration who reported the discovery of these tumors were uncertain how
to classify them, but felt there was some ‘justification for considering them low grade hepatic
cell carcinomas.’ Dr. Hueper now gives DDT the definite rating of a ‘chemical carcinogen’.
Two herbicides belonging to the carbamate group, IPC and CIPC, have been found to play a role
in producing skin tumors in mice. Some of the tumors were malignant. These chemicals seem to
initiate the malignant change, which may then be completed by other chemicals of types
prevalent in the environment.
The weed-killer aminotriazole has caused thyroid cancer in test animals. This chemical was
misused by a number of cranberry growers in 1959, producing residues on some of the
marketed berries. In the controversy that followed seizure of contaminated cranberries by the
Food and Drug Administration, the fact that the chemical actually is cancer producing was
widely challenged, even by many medical men. The scientific facts released by the Food and
Drug Administration clearly indicate the carcinogenic nature of aminotriazole in laboratory rats.
When these animals were fed this chemical at the rate of 100 parts per million in the drinking
water (or one teaspoonful of chemical in ten thousand teaspoonfuls of water) they began to
develop thyroid tumors at the 68th week. After two years, such tumors were present in more
than half the rats examined. They were diagnosed as various types of benign and malignant
growths. The tumors also appeared at lower levels of feeding—in fact, a level that produced no
effect was not found. No one knows, of course, the level at which aminotriazole may be
carcinogenic for man, but as a professor of medicine at Harvard University, Dr. David Rutstein,
has pointed out, the level is just as likely to be to man’s disfavor as to his advantage.
As yet insufficient time has elapsed to reveal the full effect of the new chlorinated hydrocarbon
insecticides and of the modern herbicides. Most malignancies develop so slowly that they may
require a considerable segment of the victim’s life to reach the stage of showing clinical
symptoms. In the early 1920s women who painted luminous figures on watch dials swallowed
minute amounts of radium by touching the brushes to their lips; in some of these women bone
cancers developed after a lapse of 15 or more years. A period of 15 to 30 years or even more
has been demonstrated for some cancers caused by occupational exposures to chemical
carcinogens.
In contrast to these industrial exposures to various carcinogens the first exposures to DDT date
from about 1942 for military personnel and from about 1945 for civilians, and it was not until
the early fifties that a wide variety of pesticidal chemicals came into use. The full maturing of
whatever seeds of malignancy have been sown by these chemicals is yet to come.
There is, however, one presently known exception to the fact that a long period of latency is
common to most malignancies. This exception is leukemia. Survivors of Hiroshima began to
develop leukemia only three years after the atomic bombing, and there is now reason to
believe the latent period may be considerably shorter. Other types of cancer may in time be

found to have a relatively short latent period, also, but at present leukemia seems to be the
exception to the general rule of extremely slow development. Within the period covered by the
rise of modern pesticides, the incidence of leukemia has been steadily rising. Figures available
from the National Office of Vital Statistics clearly establish a disturbing rise in malignant
diseases of the bloodforming tissues. In the year 1960, leukemia alone claimed 12,290 victims.
Deaths from all types of malignancies of blood and lymph totaled 25,400, increasing sharply
from the 16,690 figure of 1950. In terms of deaths per 100,000 of population, the increase is
from 11.1 in 1950 to 14. 1 in 1960 The increase is by no means confined to the United States; in
all countries the recorded deaths from leukemia at all ages are rising at a rate of 4 to 5 per cent
a year. What does it mean? To what lethal agent or agents, new to our environment, are people
now exposed with increasing frequency?
Such world-famous institutions as the Mayo Clinic admit hundreds of victims of these diseases
of the blood-forming organs. Dr. Malcolm Hargraves and his associates in the Hematology
Department at the Mayo Clinic report that almost without exception these patients have had a
history of exposure to various toxic chemicals, including sprays which contain DDT, chlordane,
benzene, lindane, and petroleum distillates.
Environmental diseases related to the use of various toxic substances have been increasing,
‘particularly during the past ten years’, Dr. Hargraves believes. From extensive clinical
experience he believes that ‘the vast majority of patients suffering from the blood dyscrasias
and lymphoid diseases have a significant history of exposure to the various hydrocarbons which
in turn includes most of the pesticides of today. A careful medical history will almost invariably
establish such a relationship.’ This specialist now has a large number of detailed case histories
based on every patient he has seen with leukemias, aplastic anemias, Hodgkin’s disease, and
other disorders of the blood and blood-forming tissues. ‘They had all been exposed to these
environmental agents, with a fair amount of exposure,’ he reports. What do these case
histories show? One concerned a housewife who abhorred spiders. In mid-August she had gone
into her basement with an aerosol spray containing DDT and petroleum distillate. She sprayed
the entire basement thoroughly, under the stairs, in the fruit cupboards and in all the protected
areas around ceiling and rafters. As she finished the spraying she began to feel quite ill, with
nausea and extreme anxiety and nervousness. Within the next few days she felt better,
however, and apparently not suspecting the cause of her difficulty, she repeated the entire
procedure in September, running through two more cycles of spraying, falling ill, recovering
temporarily, spraying again. After the third use of the aerosol new symptoms developed: fever,
pains in the joints and general malaise, acute phlebitis in one leg. When examined by Dr.
Hargraves she was found to be suffering from acute leukemia. She died within the following
month.
Another of Dr. Hargraves’ patients was a professional man who had his office in an old building
infested by roaches. Becoming embarrassed by the presence of these insects, he took control
measures in his own hands. He spent most of one Sunday spraying the basement and all
secluded areas. The spray was a 25 per cent DDT concentrate suspended in a solvent containing
methylated naphthalenes. Within a short time he began to bruise and bleed. He entered the
clinic bleeding from a number of hemorrhages. Studies of his blood revealed a severe
depression of the bone marrow called aplastic anemia. During the next five and one half
months he received 59 transfusions in addition to other therapy. There was partial recovery but

about nine years later a fatal leukemia developed. Where pesticides are involved, the chemicals
that figure most prominently in the case histories are DDT, lindane, benzene hexachloride, the
nitrophenols, the common moth crystal paradichlorobenzene, chlordane, and, of course, the
solvents in which they are carried. As this physician emphasizes, pure exposure to a single
chemical is the exception, rather than the rule. The commercial product usually contains
combinations of several chemicals, suspended in a petroleum distillate plus some dispersing
agent. The aromatic cyclic and unsaturated hydrocarbons of the vehicle may themselves be a
major factor in the damage done the blood-forming organs. From the practical rather than the
medical standpoint this distinction is of little importance, however, because these petroleum
solvents are an inseparable part of most common spraying practices.
The medical literature of this and other countries contains many significant cases that support
Dr. Hargraves’ belief in a cause-and-effect relation between these chemicals and leukemia and
other blood disorders. They concern such everyday people as farmers caught in the ‘fallout’ of
their own spray rigs or of planes, a college student who sprayed his study for ants and remained
in the room to study, a woman who had installed a portable lindane vaporizer in her home, a
worker in a cotton field that had been sprayed with chlordane and toxaphene. They carry, half
concealed within their medical terminology, stories of such human tragedies as that of two
young cousins in Czechoslovakia, boys who lived in the same town and had always worked and
played together. Their last and most fateful employment was at a farm cooperative where it
was their job to unload sacks of an insecticide (benzene hexachloride). Eight months later one
of the boys was stricken with acute leukemia. In nine days he was dead. At about this time his
cousin began to tire easily and to run a temperature. Within about three months his symptoms
became more severe and he, too, was hospitalized. Again the diagnosis was acute leukemia,
and again the disease ran its inevitably fatal course.
And then there is the case of a Swedish farmer, strangely reminiscent of that of the Japanese
fisherman Kuboyama of the tuna vessel the Lucky Dragon. Like Kuboyama, the farmer had been
a healthy man, gleaning his living from the land as Kuboyama had taken his from the sea. For
each man a poison drifting out of the sky carried a death sentence. For one, it was radiationpoisoned ash; for the other, chemical dust. The farmer had treated about 60 acres of land with
a dust containing DDT and benzene hexachloride. As he worked puffs of wind brought little
clouds of dust swirling about him. ‘In the evening he felt unusually tired, and during the
subsequent days he had a general feeling of weakness, with backache and aching legs as well as
chills, and was obliged to take to his bed,’ says a report from the Medical Clinic at Lund. ‘His
condition became worse, however, and on May 19 [a week after the spraying] he applied for
admission to the local hospital.’ He had a high fever and his blood count was abnormal. He was
transferred to the Medical Clinic, where, after an illness of two and one half months, he died. A
post-mortem examination revealed a complete wasting away of the bone marrow. . . .
How a normal and necessary process such as cell division can become altered so that it is alien
and destructive is a problem that has engaged the attention of countless scientists and untold
sums of money. What happens in a cell to change its orderly multiplication into the wild and
uncontrolled proliferation of cancer? When answers are found they will almost certainly be
multiple. Just as cancer itself is a disease that wears many guises, appearing in various forms
that differ in their origin, in the course of their development, and in the factors that influence
their growth or regression, so there must be a corresponding variety of causes. Yet underlying

them all, perhaps, only a few basic kinds of injuries to the cell are responsible. Here and there,
in research widely scattered and sometimes not undertaken as a cancer study at all, we see
glimmerings of the first light that may one day illuminate this problem.
Again we find that only by looking at some of the smallest units of life, the cell and its
chromosomes, can we find that wider vision needed to penetrate such mysteries. Here, in this
microcos m, we must look for those factors that somehow shift the marvelously functioning
mechanisms of the cell out of their normal patterns. One of the most impressive theories of the
origin of cancer cells was developed by a German biochemist, Professor Otto Warburg of the
Max Planck Institute of Cell Physiology. Warburg has devoted a lifetime of study to the complex
processes of oxidation within the cell. Out of this broad background of understanding came a
fascinating and lucid explanation of the way a normal cell can become malignant. Warburg
believes that either radiation or a chemical carcinogen acts by destroying the respiration of
normal cells, thus depriving them of energy. This action may result from minute doses often
repeated. The effect, once achieved, is irreversible. The cells not killed outright by the impact of
such a respiratory poison struggle to compensate for the loss of energy. They can no longer
carry on that extraordinary and efficient cycle by which vast amounts of ATP are produced, but
are thrown back on a primitive and far less efficient method, that of fermentation. The struggle
to survive by fermentation continues for a long period of time. It continues through ensuing cell
divisions, so that all the descendant cells have this abnormal method of respiration. Once a cell
has lost its normal respiration it cannot regain it—not in a year, not in a decade or in many
decades. But little by little, in this grueling struggle to restore lost energy, those cells that
survive begin to compensate by increased fermentation. It is a Darwinian struggle, in which only
the most fit or adaptable survive. At last they reach the point where fermentation is able to
produce as much energy as respiration. At this point, cancer cells may be said to have been
created from normal body cells.
Warburg’s theory explains many otherwise puzzling things. The long latent period of most
cancers is the time required for the infinite number of cell divisions during which fermentation
is gradually increasing after the initial damage to respiration. The time required for
fermentation to become dominant varies in different species because of different fermentation
rates: a short time in the rat, in which cancers appear quickly, a long time (decades even) in
man, in whom the development of malignancy is a deliberate process.
The Warburg theory also explains why repeated small doses of a carcinogen are more
dangerous under some circumstances than a single large dose. The latter may kill the cells
outright, whereas the small doses allow some to survive, though in a damaged condition. These
survivors may then develop into cancer cells. This is why there is no ‘safe’ dose of a carcinogen.
In Warburg’s theory we also find explanation of an otherwise incomprehensible fact—that one
and the same agent can be useful in treating cancer and can also cause it. This, as everyone
knows, is true of radiation, which kills cancer cells but may also cause cancer. It is also true of
many of the chemicals now used against cancer. Why? Both types of agents damage
respiration. Cancer cells already have a defective respiration, so with additional damage they
die. The normal cells, suffering respiratory damage for the first time, are not killed but are set
on the path that may eventually lead to malignancy.
Warburg’s ideas received confirmation in 1953 when other workers were able to turn normal
cells into cancer cells merely by depriving them of oxygen intermittently over long periods.

Then in 1961 other confirmation came, this time from living animals rather than tissue cultures.
Radioactive tracer substances were injected into cancerous mice. Then by careful
measurements of their respiration, it was found that the fermentation rate was markedly above
normal, just as Warburg had foreseen. Measured by the standards established by Warburg,
most pesticides meet the criterion of the perfect carcinogen too well for comfort. As we have
seen in the preceding chapter, many of the chlorinated hydrocarbons, the phenols, and some
herbicides interfere with oxidation and energy production within the cell. By these means they
may be creating sleeping cancer cells, in which an irreversible malignancy will slumber long and
undetected until finally—its cause long forgotten and even unsuspected—it flares into the open
as recognizable cancer.
Another path to cancer may be by way of the chromosomes. Many of the most distinguished
research men in this field look with suspicion on any agent that damages the chromosomes,
interferes with cell division, or causes mutations. In the view of these men any mutation is a
potential cause of cancer. Although discussions of mutations usually refer to those in the germ
cells, which may then make their effect felt in future generations, there may also be mutations
in the body cells. According to the mutation theory of the origin of cancer, a cell, perhaps under
the influence of radiation or of a chemical, develops a mutation that allows it to escape the
controls the body normally asserts over cell division. It is therefore able to multiply in a wild
and unregulated manner. The new cells resulting from these divisions have the same ability to
escape control, and in time enough such cells have accumulated to constitute a cancer. Other
investigators point to the fact that the chromosomes in cancer tissue are unstable; they tend to
be broken or damaged, the number may be erratic, there may even be double sets.
The first investigators to trace chromosome abnormalities all the way to actual malignancy
were Albert Levan and John J. Biesele, working at the Sloan-Kettering Institute in New York. As
to which came first, the malignancy or the disturbance of the chromosomes, these workers say
without hesitation that ‘the chromosomal irregularities precede the malignancy.’ Perhaps, they
speculate, after the initial chromosome damage and the resulting instability there is a long
period of trial and error through many cell generations (the long latent period of malignancy)
during which a collection of mutations is finally accumulated which allow the cells to escape
from control and embark on the unregulated multiplication that is cancer.
Ojvind Winge, one of the early proponents of the theory of chromosome instability, felt that
chromosome doublings were especially significant. Is it coincidence, then, that benzene
hexachloride and its relative, lindane, are known through repeated observations to double the
chromosomes in experimental plants —and that these same chemicals have been implicated in
many well-documented cases of fatal anemias? And what of the many other pesticides that
interfere with cell division, break chromosomes, cause mutations? It is easy to see why
leukemia should be one of the most common diseases to result from exposure to radiation or
to chemicals that imitate radiation. The principal targets of physical or chemical mutagenic
agents are cells that are undergoing especially active division. This includes various tissues but
most importantly those engaged in the production of blood. The bone marrow is the chief
producer of red blood cells throughout life, sending some 10 million new cells per second into
the bloodstream of man. White corpuscles are formed in the lymph glands and in some of the
marrow cells at a variable, but still prodigious, rate.

Certain chemicals, again reminding us of radiation products like Strontium 90, have a peculiar
affinity for the bone marrow. Benzene, a frequent constituent of insecticidal solvents, lodges in
the marrow and remains deposited there for periods known to be as long as 20 months.
Benzene itself has been recognized in medical literature for many years as a cause of leukemia.
The rapidly growing tissues of a child would also afford conditions most suitable for the
development of malignant cells. Sir Macfarlane Burnet has pointed out that not only is
leukemia increasing throughout the world but it has become most common in the three- to
four-year age bracket, an age incidence shown by no other disease. According to this authority,
‘The peak between three and four years of age can hardly have any other interpretation than
exposure of the young organism to a mutagenic stimulus around the time of birth.’
Another mutagen known to produce cancer is urethane. When pregnant mice are treated with
this chemical not only do they develop cancer of the lung but their young do, also. The only
exposure of the infant mice to urethane was prenatal in these experiments, proving that the
chemical must have passed through the placenta. In human populations exposed to urethane
or related chemicals there is a possibility that tumors will develop in infants through prenatal
exposure, as Dr. Hueper has warned. Urethane as a carbamate is chemically related to the
herbicides IPC and CIPC. Despite the warnings of cancer experts, carbamates are now widely
used, not only as insecticides, weed killers, and fungicides, but also in a variety of products
including plasticizers, medicines, clothing, and insulating materials. . . .
The road to cancer may also be an indirect one. A substance that is not a carcinogen in the
ordinary sense may disturb the normal functioning of some part of the body in such a way that
malignancy results. Important examples are the cancers, especially of the reproductive system,
that appear to be linked with disturbances of the balance of sex hormones; these disturbances,
in turn, may in some cases be the result of something that affects the ability of the liver to
preserve a proper level of these hormones. The chlorinated hydrocarbons are precisely the kind
of agent that can bring about this kind of indirect carcinogenesis, because all of them are toxic
in some degree to the liver. The sex hormones are, of course, normally present in the body and
perform a necessary growth-stimulating function in relation to the various organs of
reproduction. But the body has a built-in protection against excessive accumulations, for the
liver acts to keep a proper balance between male and female hormones (both are produced in
the bodies of both sexes, although in different amounts) and to prevent an excess accumulation
of either. It cannot do so, however, if it has been damaged by disease or chemicals, or if the
supply of the B-complex vitamins has been reduced. Under these conditions the estrogens build
up to abnormally high levels.
What are the effects? In animals, at least, there is abundant evidence from experiments. In one
such, an investigator at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research found that rabbits with
livers damaged by disease show a very high incidence of uterine tumors, thought to have
developed because the liver was no longer able to inactivate the estrogens in the blood, so that
they ‘subsequently rose to a carcinogenic level.’ Extensive experiments on mice, rats, guinea
pigs, and monkeys show that prolonged administration of estrogens (not necessarily at high
levels) has caused changes in the tissues of the reproductive organs, ‘varying from benign
overgrowth to definite malignancy’. Tumors of the kidneys have been induced in hamsters by
administering estrogens. Although medical opinion is divided on the question, much evidence
exists to support the view that similar effects may occur in human tissues. Investigators at the

Royal Victoria Hospital at McGill University found two thirds of 150 cases of uterine cancer
studied by them gave evidence of abnormally high estrogen levels. In 90 per cent of a later
series of 20 cases there was similar high estrogen activity.
It is possible to have liver damage sufficient to interfere with estrogen elimination without
detection of the damage by any tests now available to the medical profession. This can easily be
caused by the chlorinated hydrocarbons, which, as we have seen, set up changes in liver cells at
very low levels of intake. They also cause loss of the B vitamins. This, too, is extremely
important, for other chains of evidence show the protective role of these vitamins against
cancer. The late C. P. Rhoads, onetime director of the Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer
Research, found that test animals exposed to a very potent chemical carcinogen developed no
cancer if they had been fed yeast, a rich source of the natural B vitamins. A deficiency of these
vitamins has been found to accompany mouth cancer and perhaps cancer of other sites in the
digestive tract. This has been observed not only in the United States but in the far northern
parts of Sweden and Finland, where the diet is ordinarily deficient in vitamins. Groups prone to
primary liver cancer, as for example the Bantu tribes of Africa, are typically subject to
malnutrition. Cancer of the male breast is also prevalent in parts of Africa, associated with liver
disease and malnutrition. In postwar Greece enlargement of the male breast was a common
accompaniment of periods of starvation.
In brief, the argument for the indirect role of pesticides in cancer is based on their proven
ability to damage the liver and to reduce the supply of B vitamins, thus leading to an increase in
the ‘endogenous’ estrogens, or those produced by the body itself. Added to these are the wide
variety of synthetic estrogens to which we are increasingly exposed—those in cosmetics, drugs,
foods, and occupational exposures. The combined effect is a matter that warrants the most
serious concern. . . .
Human exposures to cancer-producing chemicals (including pesticides) are uncontrolled and
they are multiple. An individual may have many different exposures to the same chemical.
Arsenic is an example. It exists in the environment of every individual in many different guises:
as an air pollutant, a contaminant of water, a pesticide residue on food, in medicines,
cosmetics, wood preservatives, or as a coloring agent in paints and inks. It is quite possible that
no one of these exposures alone would be sufficient to precipitate malignancy—yet any single
supposedly ‘safe dose’ may be enough to tip the scales that are already loaded with other ‘safe
doses’. Or again the harm may be done by two or more different carcinogens acting together,
so that there is a summation of their effects. The individual exposed to DDT, for example, is
almost certain to be exposed to other liver-damaging hydrocarbons, which are so widely used
as solvents, paint removers, degreasing agents, dry-cleaning fluids, and anesthetics. What then
can be a ‘safe dose’ of DDT? The situation is made even more complicated by the fact that one
chemical may act on another to alter its effect. Cancer may sometimes require the
complementary action of two chemicals, one of which sensitizes the cell or tissue so that it may
later, under the action of another or promoting agent, develop true malignancy. Thus, the
herbicides IPC and CIPC may act as initiators in the production of skin tumors, sowing the seeds
of malignancy that may be brought into actual being by something else—perhaps a common
detergent.
There may be interaction, too, between a physical and a chemical agent. Leukemia may occur
as a two-step process, the malignant change being initiated by X-radiation, the promoting

action being supplied by a chemical, as, for example, urethane. The growing exposure of the
population to radiation from various sources, plus the many contacts with a host of chemicals
suggest a grave new problem for the modern world. The pollution of water supplies with
radioactive materials poses another problem. Such materials, present as contaminants in water
that also contains chemicals, may actually change the nature of the chemicals by the impact of
ionizing radiation, rearranging their atoms in unpredictable ways to create new chemicals.
Water pollution experts throughout the United States are concerned by the fact that
detergents are now a troublesome and practically universal contaminant of public water
supplies. There is no practical way to remove them by treatment. Few detergents are known to
be carcinogenic, but in an indirect way they may promote cancer by acting on the lining of the
digestive tract, changing the tissues so that they more easily absorb dangerous chemicals,
thereby aggravating their effect. But who can foresee and control this action? In the
kaleidoscope of shifting conditions, what dose of a carcinogen can be ‘safe’ except a zero dose?
We tolerate cancer-causing agents in our environment at our peril, as was clearly illustrated by
a recent happening. In the spring of 1961 an epidemic of liver cancer appeared among rainbow
trout in many federal, state, and private hatcheries. Trout in both eastern and western parts of
the United States were affected; in some areas practically 100 per cent of the trout over three
years of age developed cancer. This discovery was made because of a preexisting arrangement
between the Environmental Cancer Section of the National Cancer Institute and the Fish and
Wildlife Service for the reporting of all fish with tumors, so that early warning might be had of a
cancer hazard to man from water contaminants.
Although studies are still under way to determine the exact cause of this epidemic over so wide
an area, the best evidence is said to point to some agent present in the prepared hatchery
feeds. These contain an incredible variety of chemical additives and medicinal agents in
addition to the basic foodstuffs. The story of the trout is important for many reasons, but
chiefly as an example of what can happen when a potent carcinogen is introduced into the
environment of any species. Dr. Hueper has described this epidemic as a serious warning that
greatly increased attention must be given to controlling the number and variety of
environmental carcinogens. ‘If such preventive measures are not taken,’ says Dr. Hueper, ‘the
stage will be set at a progressive rate for the future occurrence of a similar disaster to the
human population.’ The discovery that we are, as one investigator phrased it, living in a ‘sea of
carcinogens’ is of course dismaying and may easily lead to reactions of despair and defeatism.
‘Isn’t it a hopeless situation?’ is the common reaction. ‘Isn’t it impossible even to attempt to
eliminate these cancer-producing agents from our world? Wouldn’t it be better not to waste
time trying, but instead to put all our efforts into research to find a cure for cancer?’
When this question is put to Dr. Hueper, whose years of distinguished work in cancer make his
opinion one to respect, his reply is given with the thoughtfulness of one who has pondered it
long, and has a lifetime of research and experience behind his judgment. Dr. Hueper believes
that our situation with regard to cancer today is very similar to that which faced mankind with
regard to infectious diseases in the closing years of the 19th century. The causative relation
between pathogenic organisms and many diseases had been established through the brilliant
work of Pasteur and Koch. Medical men and even the general public were becoming aware that
the human environment was inhabited by an enormous number of microorganisms capable of
causing disease, just as today carcinogens pervade our surroundings. Most infectious diseases

have now been brought under a reasonable degree of control and some have been practically
eliminated. This brilliant medical achievement came about by an attack that was twofold—that
stressed prevention as well as cure. Despite the prominence that ‘magic bullets’ and ‘wonder
drugs’ hold in the layman’s mind, most of the really decisive battles in the war against
infectious disease consisted of measures to eliminate disease organisms from the environment.
An example from history concerns the great outbreak of cholera in London more than one
hundred years ago. A London physician, John Snow, mapped the occurrence of cases and found
they originated in one area, all of whose inhabitants drew their water from one pump located
on Broad Street. In a swift and decisive practice of preventive medicine, Dr. Snow removed the
handle from the pump. The epidemic was brought under control—not by a magic pill that killed
the (then unknown) organism of cholera, but by eliminating the organism from the
environment. Even therapeutic measures have the important result not only of curing the
patient but of reducing the foci of infection. The present comparative rarity of tuberculosis
results in large measure from the fact that the average person now seldom comes into contact
with the tubercle bacillus. Today we find our world filled with cancer-producing agents. An
attack on cancer that is concentrated wholly or even largely on therapeutic measures (even
assuming a ‘cure’ could be found) in Dr. Hueper’s opinion will fail because it leaves untouched
the great reservoirs of carcinogenic agents which would continue to claim new victims faster
than the as yet elusive ‘cure’ could allay the disease.
Why have we been slow to adopt this common-sense approach to the cancer problem?
Probably ‘the goal of curing the victims of cancer is more exciting, more tangible, more
glamorous and rewarding than prevention,’ says Dr. Hueper. Yet to prevent cancer from ever
being formed is ‘definitely more humane’ and can be ‘much more effective than cancer cures’.
Dr. Hueper has little patience with the wishful thinking that promises ‘a magic pill that we shall
take each morning before breakfast’ as protection against cancer. Part of the public trust in
such an eventual outcome results from the misconception that cancer is a single, though
mysterious disease, with a single cause and, hopefully, a single cure. This of course is far from
the known truth. Just as environmental cancers are induced by a wide variety of chemical and
physical agents, so the malignant condition itself is manifested in many different and
biologically distinct ways. The long promised ‘breakthrough’, when or if it comes, cannot be
expected to be a panacea for all types of malignancy. Although the search must be continued
for therapeutic measures to relieve and to cure those who have already become victims of
cancer, it is a disservice to humanity to hold out the hope that the solution will come suddenly,
in a single master stroke. It will come slowly, one step at a time. Meanwhile as we pour our
millions into research and invest all our hopes in vast programs to find cures for established
cases of cancer, we are neglecting the golden opportunity to prevent, even while we seek to
cure.
The task is by no means a hopeless one. In one important respect the outlook is more
encouraging than the situation regarding infectious disease at the turn of the century. The
world was then full of disease germs, as today it is full of carcinogens. But man did not put the
germs into the environment and his role in spreading them was involuntary. In contrast, man
has put the vast majority of carcinogens into the environment, and he can, if he wishes,
eliminate many of them. The chemical agents of cancer have become entrenched in our world
in two ways: first, and ironically, through man’s search for a better and easier way of life;

second, because the manufacture and sale of such chemicals has become an accepted part of
our economy and our way of life. It would be unrealistic to suppose that all chemical
carcinogens can or will be eliminated from the modern world. But a very large proportion are
by no means necessities of life. By their elimination the total load of carcinogens would be
enormously lightened, and the threat that one in every four will develop cancer would at least
be greatly mitigated. The most determined effort should be made to eliminate those
carcinogens that now contaminate our food, our water supplies, and our atmosphere, because
these provide the most dangerous type of contact—minute exposures, repeated over and over
throughout the years.
Among the most eminent men in cancer research are many others who share Dr. Hueper’s
belief that malignant diseases can be reduced significantly by determined efforts to identify the
environmental causes and to eliminate them or reduce their impact. For those in whom cancer
is already a hidden or a visible presence, efforts to find cures must of course continue. But for
those not yet touched by the disease and certainly for the generations as yet unborn,
prevention is the imperative need.

15. Nature Fights Back
TO HAVE RISKED so much in our efforts to mold nature to our satisfaction and yet to
have failed in achieving our goal would indeed be the final irony. Yet this, it seems, is our
situation. The truth, seldom mentioned but there for anyone to see, is that nature is not so
easily molded and that the insects are finding ways to circumvent our chemical attacks on
them.
‘The insect world is nature’s most astonishing phenomenon,’ said the Dutch biologist C. J.
Briejèr. ‘Nothing is impossible to it; the most improbable things commonly occur there. One
who penetrates deeply into its mysteries is continually breathless with wonder. He knows that
anything can happen, and that the completely impossible often does.’ The ‘impossible’ is now
happening on two broad fronts. By a process of genetic selection, the insects are developing
strains resistant to chemicals. This will be discussed in the following chapter. But the broader
problem, which we shall look at now, is the fact that our chemical attack is weakening the
defenses inherent in the environment itself, defenses designed to keep the various species in
check. Each time we breach these defenses a horde of insects pours through.
From all over the world come reports that make it clear we are in a serious predicament. At the
end of a decade or more of intensive chemical control, entomologists were finding that
problems they had considered solved a few years earlier had returned to plague them. And new
problems had arisen as insects once present only in insignificant numbers had increased to the
status of serious pests. By their very nature chemical controls are self-defeating, for they have
been devised and applied without taking into account the complex biological systems against
which they have been blindly hurled. The chemicals may have been pretested against a few
individual species, but not against living communities. In some quarters nowadays it is
fashionable to dismiss the balance of nature as a state of affairs that prevailed in an earlier,
simpler world—a state that has now been so thoroughly upset that we might as well forget it.
Some find this a convenient assumption, but as a chart for a course of action it is highly
dangerous. The balance of nature is not the same today as in Pleistocene times, but it is still
there: a complex, precise, and highly integrated system of relationships between living things
which cannot safely be ignored any more than the law of gravity can be defied with impunity by
a man perched on the edge of a cliff. The balance of nature is not a status quo; it is fluid, ever
shifting, in a constant state of adjustment. Man, too, is part of this balance. Sometimes the
balance is in his favor; sometimes—and all too often through his own activities—it is shifted to
his disadvantage.
Two critically important facts have been overlooked in designing the modern insect control
programs. The first is that the really effective control of insects is that applied by nature, not by
man. Populations are kept in check by something the ecologists call the resistance of the
environment, and this has been so since the first life was created. The amount of food
available, conditions of weather and climate, the presence of competing or predatory species,
all are critically important. ‘The greatest single factor in preventing insects from overwhelming
the rest of the world is the internecine warfare which they carry out among themselves,’ said
the entomologist Robert Metcalf. Yet most of the chemicals now used kill all insects, our friends
and enemies alike.

The second neglected fact is the truly explosive power of a species to reproduce once the
resistance of the environment has been weakened. The fecundity of many forms of life is
almost beyond our power to imagine, though now and then we have suggestive glimpses. I
remember from student days the miracle that could be wrought in a jar containing a simple
mixture of hay and water merely by adding to it a few drops of material from a mature culture
of protozoa. Within a few days the jar would contain a whole galaxy of whirling, darting life—
uncountable trillions of the slipper animalcule, Paramecium, each small as a dust grain, all
multiplying without restraint in their temporary Eden of favorable temperatures, abundant
food, absence of enemies. Or I think of shore rocks white with barnacles as far as the eye can
see, or of the spectacle of passing through an immense school of jellyfish, mile after mile, with
seemingly no end to the pulsing, ghostly forms scarcely more substantial than the water itself.
We see the miracle of nature’s control at work when the cod move through winter seas to their
spawning grounds, where each female deposits several millions of eggs. The sea does not
become a solid mass of cod as it would surely do if all the progeny of all the cod were to
survive. The checks that exist in nature are such that out of the millions of young produced by
each pair only enough, on the average, survive to adulthood to replace the parent fish.
Biologists used to entertain themselves by speculating as to what would happen if, through
some unthinkable catastrophe, the natural restraints were thrown off and all the progeny of a
single individual survived. Thus Thomas Huxley a century ago calculated that a single female
aphis (which has the curious power of reproducing without mating) could produce progeny in a
single year’s time whose total weight would equal that of the inhabitants of the Chinese empire
of his day. Fortunately for us such an extreme situation is only theoretical, but the dire results
of upsetting nature’s own arrangements are well known to students of animal populations. The
stockman’s zeal for eliminating the coyote has resulted in plagues of field mice, which the
coyote formerly controlled. The oft repeated story of the Kaibab deer in Arizona is another case
in point. At one time the deer population was in equilibrium with its environment. A number of
predators—wolves, pumas, and coyotes—prevented the deer from outrunning their food
supply. Then a campaign was begun to ‘conserve’ the deer by killing off their enemies. Once the
predators were gone, the deer increased prodigiously and soon there was not enough food for
them. The browse line on the trees went higher and higher as they sought food, and in time
many more deer were dying of starvation than had formerly been killed by predators. The
whole environment, moreover, was damaged by their desperate efforts to find food.
The predatory insects of field and forests play the same role as the wolves and coyotes of the
Kaibab. Kill them off and the population of the prey insect surges upward. No one knows how
many species of insects inhabit the earth because so many are yet to be identified. But more
than 700,000 have already been described. This means that in terms of the number of species,
70 to 80 per cent of the earth’s creatures are insects. The vast majority of these insects are held
in check by natural forces, without any intervention by man. If this were not so, it is doubtful
that any conceivable volume of chemicals —or any other methods—could possibly keep down
their populations. The trouble is that we are seldom aware of the protection afforded by
natural enemies until it fails. Most of us walk unseeing through the world, unaware alike of its
beauties, its wonders, and the strange and sometimes terrible intensity of the lives that are
being lived about us. So it is that the activities of the insect predators and parasites are known
to few.

Perhaps we may have noticed an oddly shaped insect of ferocious mien on a bush in the garden
and been dimly aware that the praying mantis lives at the expense of other insects. But we see
with understanding eye only if we have walked in the garden at night and here and there with a
flashlight have glimpsed the mantis stealthily creeping upon her prey. Then we sense
something of the drama of the hunter and the hunted. Then we begin to feel something of that
relentlessly pressing force by which nature controls her own. The predators—insects that kill
and consume other insects—are of many kinds. Some are quick and with the speed of swallows
snatch their prey from the air. Others plod methodically along a stem, plucking off and
devouring sedentary insects like the aphids. The yellowjackets capture soft-bodied insects and
feed the juices to their young. Muddauber wasps build columned nests of mud under the caves
of houses and stock them with insects on which their young will feed. The horseguard wasp
hovers above herds of grazing cattle, destroying the blood-sucking flies that torment them. The
loudly buzzing syrphid fly, often mistaken for a bee, lays its eggs on leaves of aphis-infested
plants; the hatching larvae then consume immense numbers of aphids. Ladybugs or lady
beetles are among the most effective destroyers of aphids, scale insects, and other plant-eating
insects. Literally hundreds of aphids are consumed by a single ladybug to stoke the little fires of
energy which she requires to produce even a single batch of eggs.
Even more extraordinary in their habits are the parasitic insects. These do not kill their hosts
outright. Instead, by a variety of adaptations they utilize their victims for the nurture of their
own young. They may deposit their eggs within the larvae or eggs of their prey, so that their
own developing young may find food by consuming the host. Some attach their eggs to a
caterpillar by means of a sticky solution; on hatching, the larval parasite bores through the skin
of the host. Others, led by an instinct that simulates foresight, merely lay their eggs on a leaf so
that a browsing caterpillar will eat them inadvertently.
Everywhere, in field and hedgerow and garden and forest, the insect predators and parasites
are at work. Here, above a pond, the dragonflies dart and the sun strikes fire from their wings.
So their ancestors sped through swamps where huge reptiles lived. Now, as in those ancient
times, the sharp-eyed capture mosquitoes in the air, scooping them in with basket-shaped legs.
In the waters below, their young, the dragonfly nymphs, or naiads, prey on the aquatic stages
of mosquitoes and other insects. Or there, almost invisible against a leaf, is the lacewing, with
green gauze wings and golden eyes, shy and secretive, descendant of an ancient race that lived
in Permian times. The adult lacewing feeds mostly on plant nectars and the honeydew of
aphids, and in time she lays her eggs, each on the end of a long stalk which she fastens to a leaf.
From these emerge her children—strange, bristled larvae called aphis lions, which live by
preying on aphids, scales, or mites, which they capture and suck dry of fluid. Each may consume
several hundred aphids before the ceaseless turning of the cycle of its life brings the time when
it will spin a white silken cocoon in which to pass the pupa stage.
And there are many wasps, and flies as well, whose very existence depends on the destruction
of the eggs or larvae of other insects through parasitism. Some of the egg parasites are
exceedingly minute wasps, yet by their numbers and their great activity they hold down the
abundance of many crop-destroying species. All these small creatures are working—working in
sun and rain, during the hours of darkness, even when winter’s grip has damped down the fires
of life to mere embers. Then this vital force is merely smoldering, awaiting the time to flare
again into activity when spring awakens the insect world. Meanwhile, under the white blanket

of snow, below the frosthardened soil, in crevices in the bark of trees, and in sheltered caves,
the parasites and the predators have found ways to tide themselves over the season of cold.
The eggs of the mantis are secure in little cases of thin parchment attached to the branch of a
shrub by the mother who lived her life span with the summer that is gone.
The female Polistes wasp, taking shelter in a forgotten corner of some attic, carries in her body
the fertilized eggs, the heritage on which the whole future of her colony depends. She, the lone
survivor, will start a small paper nest in the spring, lay a few eggs in its cells, and carefully rear a
small force of workers. With their help she will then enlarge the nest and develop the colony.
Then the workers, foraging ceaselessly through the hot days of summer, will destroy countless
caterpillars. Thus, through the circumstances of their lives, and the nature of our own wants, all
these have been our allies in keeping the balance of nature tilted in our favor. Yet we have
turned our artillery against our friends. The terrible danger is that we have grossly
underestimated their value in keeping at bay a dark tide of enemies that, without their help,
can overrun us.
The prospect of a general and permanent lowering of environmental resistance becomes grimly
and increasingly real with each passing year as the number, variety, and destructiveness of
insecticides grows. With the passage of time we may expect progressively more serious
outbreaks of insects, both disease-carrying and crop-destroying species, in excess of anything
we have ever known. ‘Yes, but isn’t this all theoretical?’ you may ask. ‘Surely it won’t really
happen—not in my lifetime, anyway.’ But it is happening, here and now. Scientific journals had
already recorded some 50 species involved in violent dislocations of nature’s balance by 1958.
More examples are being found every year. A recent review of the subject contained references
to 215 papers reporting or discussing unfavorable upsets in the balance of insect populations
caused by pesticides.
Sometimes the result of chemical spraying has been a tremendous upsurge of the very insect
the spraying was intended to control, as when blackflies in Ontario became 17 times more
abundant after spraying than they had been before. Or when in England an enormous outbreak
of the cabbage aphid—an outbreak that had no parallel on record—followed spraying with one
of the organic phosphorus chemicals. At other times spraying, while reasonably effective
against the target insect, has let loose a whole Pandora’s box of destructive pests that had
never previously been abundant enough to cause trouble. The spider mite, for example, has
become practically a worldwide pest as DDT and other insecticides have killed off its enemies.
The spider mite is not an insect. It is a barely visible eight-legged creature belonging to the
group that includes spiders, scorpions, and ticks. It has mouth parts adapted for piercing and
sucking, and a prodigious appetite for the chlorophyll that makes the world green. It inserts
these minute and stiletto-sharp mouth parts into the outer cells of leaves and evergreen
needles and extracts the chlorophyll. A mild infestation gives trees and shrubbery a mottled or
salt-and-pepper appearance; with a heavy mite population, foliage turns yellow and falls.
This is what happened in some of the western national forests a few years ago, when in 1956
the United States Forest Service sprayed some 885,000 acres of forested lands with DDT. The
intention was to control the spruce budworm, but the following summer it was discovered that
a problem worse than the budworm damage had been created. In surveying the forests from
the air, vast blighted areas could be seen where the magnificent Douglas firs were turning
brown and dropping their needles. In the Helena National Forest and on the western slopes of

the Big Belt Mountains, then in other areas of Montana and down into Idaho the forests looked
as though they had been scorched. It was evident that this summer of 1957 had brought the
most extensive and spectacular infestation of spider mites in history. Almost all of the sprayed
area was affected. Nowhere else was the damage evident. Searching for precedents, the
foresters could remember other scourges of spider mites, though less dramatic than this one.
There had been similar trouble along the Madison River in Yellowstone Park in 1929, in
Colorado 20 years later, and then in New Mexico in 1956. Each of these outbreaks had followed
forest spraying with insecticides. (The 1929 spraying, occurring before the DDT era, employed
lead arsenate.)
Why does the spider mite appear to thrive on insecticides? Besides the obvious fact that it is
relatively insensitive to them, there seem to be two other reasons. In nature it is kept in check
by various predators such as ladybugs, a gall midge, predaceous mites and several pirate bugs,
all of them extremely sensitive to insecticides. The third reason has to do with population
pressure within the spider mite colonies. An undisturbed colony of mites is a densely settled
community, huddled under a protective webbing for concealment from its enemies. When
sprayed, the colonies disperse as the mites, irritated though not killed by the chemicals, scatter
out in search of places where they will not be disturbed. In so doing they find a far greater
abundance of space and food than was available in the former colonies. Their enemies are now
dead so there is no need for the mites to spend their energy in secreting protective webbing.
Instead, they pour all their energies into producing more mites. It is not uncommon for their
egg production to be increased threefold—all through the beneficent effect of insecticides.
In the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, a famous apple-growing region, hordes of a small insect
called the red-banded leaf roller arose to plague the growers as soon as DDT began to replace
arsenate of lead. Its depredations had never before been important; soon its toll rose to 50 per
cent of the crop and it achieved the status of the most destructive pest of apples, not only in
this region but throughout much of the East and Midwest, as the use of DDT increased. The
situation abounds in ironies. In the apple orchards of Nova Scotia in the late 1940s the worst
infestations of the codling moth (cause of ‘wormy apples’) were in the orchards regularly
sprayed. In unsprayed orchards the moths were not abundant enough to cause real trouble.
Diligence in spraying had a similarly unsatisfactory reward in the eastern Sudan, where cotton
growers had a bitter experience with DDT. Some 60,000 acres of cotton were being grown
under irrigation in the Gash Delta. Early trials of DDT having given apparently good results,
spraying was intensified. It was then that trouble began. One of the most destructive enemies
of cotton is the bollworm. But the more cotton was sprayed, the more bollworms appeared.
The unsprayed cotton suffered less damage to fruits and later to mature bolls than the sprayed,
and in twice-sprayed fields the yield of seed cotton dropped significantly. Although some of the
leaf-feeding insects were eliminated, any benefit that might thus have been gained was more
than offset by bollworm damage. In the end the growers were faced with the unpleasant truth
that their cotton yield would have been greater had they saved themselves the trouble and
expense of spraying.
In the Belgian Congo and Uganda the results of heavy applications of DDT against an insect pest
of the coffee bush were almost ‘catastrophic’. The pest itself was found to be almost
completely unaffected by the DDT, while its predator was extremely sensitive. In America,
farmers have repeatedly traded one insect enemy for a worse one as spraying upsets the

population dynamics of the insect world. Two of the mass-spraying programs recently carried
out have had precisely this effect. One was the fire ant eradication program in the South; the
other was the spraying for the Japanese beetle in the Midwest. (See Chapters 10 and 7.)
When a wholesale application of heptachlor was made to the farmlands in Louisiana in 1957,
the result was the unleashing of one of the worst enemies of the sugarcane crop—the
sugarcane borer. Soon after the heptachlor treatment, damage by borers increased sharply.
The chemical aimed at the fire ant had killed off the enemies of the borer. The crop was so
severely damaged that farmers sought to bring suit against the state for negligence in not
warning them that this might happen. The same bitter lesson was learned by Illinois farmers.
After the devastating bath of dieldrin recently administered to the farmlands in eastern Illinois
for the control of the Japanese beetle, farmers discovered that corn borers had increased
enormously in the treated area. In fact, corn grown in fields within this area contained almost
twice as many of the destructive larvae of this insect as did the corn grown outside. The
farmers may not yet be aware of the biological basis of what has happened, but they need no
scientists to tell them they have made a poor bargain. In trying to get rid of one insect, they
have brought on a scourge of a much more destructive one. According to Department of
Agriculture estimates, total damage by the Japanese beetle in the United States adds up to
about 10 million dollars a year, while damage by the corn borer runs to about 85 million.
It is worth noting that natural forces had been heavily relied on for control of the corn borer.
Within two years after this insect was accidentally introduced from Europe in 1917, the United
States Government had mounted one of its most intensive programs for locating and importing
parasites of an insect pest. Since that time 24 species of parasites of the corn borer have been
brought in from Europe and the Orient at considerable expense. Of these, 5 are recognized as
being of distinct value in control. Needless to say, the results of all this work are now
jeopardized as the enemies of the corn borer are killed off by the sprays.
If this seems absurd, consider the situation in the citrus groves of California, where the world’s
most famous and successful experiment in biological control was carried out in the 1880s. In
1872 a scale insect that feeds on the sap of citrus trees appeared in California and within the
next 25 years developed into a pest so destructive that the fruit crop in many orchards was a
complete loss. The young citrus industry was threatened with destruction. Many farmers gave
up and pulled out their trees. Then a parasite of the scale insect was imported from Australia, a
small lady beetle called the vedalia. Within only two years after the first shipment of the
beetles, the scale was under complete control throughout the citrus-growing sections of
California. From that time on one could search for days among the orange groves without
finding a single scale insect.
Then in the 1940s the citrus growers began to experiment with glamorous new chemicals
against other insects. With the advent of DDT and the even more toxic chemicals to follow, the
populations of the vedalia in many sections of California were wiped out. Its importation had
cost the government a mere $5000. Its activities had saved the fruit growers several millions of
dollars a year, but in a moment of heedlessness the benefit was canceled out. Infestations of
the scale insect quickly reappeared and damage exceeded anything that had been seen for fifty
years. ‘This possibly marked the end of an era,’ said Dr. Paul DeBach of the Citrus Experiment
Station in Riverside. Now control of the scale has become enormously complicated. The vedalia
can be maintained only by repeated releases and by the most careful attention to spray

schedules, to minimize their contact with insecticides. And regardless of what the citrus
growers do, they are more or less at the mercy of the owners of adjacent acreages, for severe
damage has been done by insecticidal drift. . . .
All these examples concern insects that attack agricultural crops. What of those that carry
disease? There have already been warnings. On Nissan Island in the South Pacific, for example,
spraying had been carried on intensively during the Second World War, but was stopped when
hostilities came to an end. Soon swarms of a malaria-carrying mosquito reinvaded the island.
All of its predators had been killed off and there had not been time for new populations to
become established. The way was therefore clear for a tremendous population explosion.
Marshall Laird, who has described this incident, compares chemical control to a treadmill; once
we have set foot on it we are unable to stop for fear of the consequences.
In some parts of the world disease can be linked with spraying in quite a different way. For
some reason, snail-like mollusks seem to be almost immune to the effects of insecticides. This
has been observed many times. In the general holocaust that followed the spraying of salt
marshes in eastern Florida (pages 115-116), aquatic snails alone survived. The scene as
described was a macabre picture—something that might have been created by a surrealist
brush. The snails moved among the bodies of the dead fishes and the moribund crabs,
devouring the victims of the death rain of poison. But why is this important? It is important
because many aquatic snails serve as hosts of dangerous parasitic worms that spend part of
their life cycle in a mollusk, part in a human being. Examples are the blood flukes, or
schistosoma, that cause serious disease in man when they enter the body by way of drinking
water or through the skin when people are bathing in infested waters. The flukes are released
into the water by the host snails. Such diseases are especially prevalent in parts of Asia and
Africa. Where they occur, insect control measures that favor a vast increase of snails are likely
to be followed by grave consequences.
And of course man is not alone in being subject to snail-borne disease. Liver disease in cattle,
sheep, goats, deer, elk, rabbits, and various other warm-blooded animals may be caused by
liver flukes that spend part of their life cycles in fresh-water snails. Livers infested with these
worms are unfit for use as human food and are routinely condemned. Such rejections cost
American cattlemen about 3½ million dollars annually. Anything that acts to increase the
number of snails can obviously make this problem an even more serious one. . . .
Over the past decade these problems have cast long shadows, but we have been slow to
recognize them. Most of those best fitted to develop natural controls and assist in putting them
into effect have been too busy laboring in the more exciting vineyards of chemical control. It
was reported in 1960 that only 2 per cent of all the economic entomologists in the country
were then working in the field of biological controls. A substantial number of the remaining 98
per cent were engaged in research on chemical insecticides.
Why should this be? The major chemical companies are pouring money into the universities to
support research on insecticides. This creates attractive fellowships for graduate students and
attractive staff positions. Biological-control studies, on the other hand, are never so endowed—
for the simple reason that they do not promise anyone the fortunes that are to be made in the
chemical industry. These are left to state and federal agencies, where the salaries paid are far
less. This situation also explains the otherwise mystifying fact that certain outstanding
entomologists are among the leading advocates of chemical control. Inquiry into the

background of some of these men reveals that their entire research program is supported by
the chemical industry. Their professional prestige, sometimes their very jobs depend on the
perpetuation of chemical methods. Can we then expect them to bite the hand that literally
feeds them? But knowing their bias, how much credence can we give to their protests that
insecticides are harmless? Amid the general acclaim for chemicals as the principal method of
insect control, minority reports have occasionally been filed by those few entomologists who
have not lost sight of the fact that they are neither chemists nor engineers, but biologists.
F. H. Jacob in England has declared that ‘the activities of many so-called economic
entomologists would make it appear that they operate in the belief that salvation lies at the
end of a spray nozzle...that when they have created problems of resurgence or resistance or
mammalian toxicity, the chemist will be ready with another pill. That view is not held
here...Ultimately only the biologist will provide the answers to the basic problems of pest
control.’ ‘Economic entomologists must realize,’ wrote A. D. Pickett of Nova Scotia, ‘that they
are dealing with living things...their work must be more than simply insecticide testing or a
quest for highly destructive chemicals.’ Dr. Pickett himself was a pioneer in the field of working
out sane methods of insect control that take full advantage of the predatory and parasitic
species. The method which he and his associates evolved is today a shining model but one too
little emulated. Only in the integrated control programs developed by some California
entomologists do we find anything comparable in this country.
Dr. Pickett began his work some thirty-five years ago in the apple orchards of the Annapolis
Valley in Nova Scotia, once one of the most concentrated fruit-growing areas in Canada. At that
time it was believed that insecticides—then inorganic chemicals—would solve the problems of
insect control, that the only task was to induce fruit growers to follow the recommended
methods. But the rosy picture failed to materialize. Somehow the insects persisted. New
chemicals were added, better spraying equipment was devised, and the zeal for spraying
increased, but the insect problem did not get any better. Then DDT promised to ‘obliterate the
nightmare’ of codling moth outbreaks. What actually resulted from its use was an
unprecedented scourge of mites. ‘We move from crisis to crisis, merely trading one problem for
another,’ said Dr. Pickett.
At this point, however, Dr. Pickett and his associates struck out on a new road instead of going
along with other entomologists who continued to pursue the will-o’-the-wisp of the ever more
toxic chemical. Recognizing that they had a strong ally in nature, they devised a program that
makes maximum use of natural controls and minimum use of insecticides. Whenever
insecticides are applied only minimum dosages are used—barely enough to control the pest
without avoidable harm to beneficial species. Proper timing also enters in. Thus, if nicotine
sulphate is applied before rather than after the apple blossoms turn pink one of the important
predators is spared, probably because it is still in the egg stage.
Dr. Pickett uses special care to select chemicals that will do as little harm as possible to insect
parasites and predators. ‘When we reach the point of using DDT, parathion, chlordane, and
other new insecticides as routine control measures in the same way we have used the inorganic
chemicals in the past, entomologists interested in biological control may as well throw in the
sponge,’ he says. Instead of these highly toxic, broad-spectrum insecticides, he places chief
reliance on ryania (derived from ground stems of a tropical plant), nicotine sulphate, and lead
arsenate. In certain situations very weak concentrations of DDT or malathion are used (1 or 2

ounces per 100 gallons in contrast to the usual 1 or 2 pounds per 100 gallons). Although these
two are the least toxic of the modern insecticides, Dr. Pickett hopes by further research to
replace them with safer and more selective materials.
How well has this program worked? Nova Scotia orchardists who are following Dr. Pickett’s
modified spray program are producing as high a proportion of first-grade fruit as are those who
are using intensive chemical applications. They are also getting as good production. They are
getting these results, moreover, at a substantially lower cost. The outlay for insecticides in Nova
Scotia apple orchards is only from 10 to 20 per cent of the amount spent in most other applegrowing areas. More important than even these excellent results is the fact that the modified
program worked out by these Nova Scotian entomologists is not doing violence to nature’s
balance. It is well on the way to realizing the philosophy stated by the Canadian entomologist
G. C. Ullyett a decade ago: ‘We must change our philosophy, abandon our attitude of human
superiority and admit that in many cases in natural environments we find ways and means of
limiting populations of organisms in a more economical way than we can do it ourselves.’

16. The Rumblings of an Avalanche
IF DARWIN were alive today the insect world would delight and astound him with its
impressive verification of his theories of the survival of the fittest. Under the stress of intensive
chemical spraying the weaker members of the insect populations are being weeded out. Now,
in many areas and among many species only the strong and fit remain to defy our efforts to
control them. Nearly half a century ago, a professor of entomology at Washington State
College, A. L. Melander, asked the now purely rhetorical question, ‘Can insects become
resistant to sprays?’ If the answer seemed to Melander unclear, or slow in coming, that was
only because he asked his question too soon—in 1914 instead of 40 years later. In the pre-DDT
era, inorganic chemicals, applied on a scale that today would seem extraordinarily modest,
produced here and there strains of insects that could survive chemical spraying or dusting.
Melander himself had run into difficulty with the San Jose scale, for some years satisfactorily
controlled by spraying with lime sulfur. Then in the Clarkston area of Washington the insects
became refractory—they were harder to kill than in the orchards of the Wenatchee and Yakima
valleys and elsewhere.
Suddenly the scale insects in other parts of the country seemed to have got the same idea: it
was not necessary for them to die under the sprayings of lime sulfur, diligently and liberally
applied by orchardists. Throughout much of the Midwest thousands of acres of fine orchards
were destroyed by insects now impervious to spraying. Then in California the time-honored
method of placing canvas tents over trees and fumigating them with hydrocyanic acid began to
yield disappointing results in certain areas, a problem that led to research at the California
Citrus Experiment Station, beginning about 1915 and continuing for a quarter of a century.
Another insect to learn the profitable way of resistance was the codling moth, or appleworm, in
the 1920s, although lead arsenate had been used successfully against it for some 40 years.
But it was the advent of DDT and all its many relatives that ushered in the true Age of
Resistance. It need have surprised no one with even the simplest knowledge of insects or of the
dynamics of animal populations that within a matter of a very few years an ugly and dangerous
problem had clearly defined itself. Yet awareness of the fact that insects possess an effective
counterweapon to aggressive chemical attack seems to have dawned slowly. Only those
concerned with disease-carrying insects seem by now to have been thoroughly aroused to the
alarming nature of the situation; the agriculturists still for the most part blithely put their faith
in the development of new and ever more toxic chemicals, although the present difficulties
have been born of just such specious reasoning.
If understanding of the phenomenon of insect resistance developed slowly, it was far otherwise
with resistance itself. Before 1945 only about a dozen species were known to have developed
resistance to any of the pre-DDT insecticides. With the new organic chemicals and new
methods for their intensive application, resistance began a meteoric rise that reached the
alarming level of 137 species in 1960. No one believes the end is in sight. More than 1000
technical papers have now been published on the subject. The World Health Organization has
enlisted the aid of some 300 scientists in all parts of the world, declaring that ‘resistance is at
present the most important single problem facing vector-control programmes.’ A distinguished

British student of animal populations, Dr. Charles Elton, has said, ‘We are hearing the early
rumblings of what may become an avalanche in strength.’
Sometimes resistance develops so rapidly that the ink is scarcely dry on a report hailing
successful control of a species with some specified chemical when an amended report has to be
issued. In South Africa, for example, cattlemen had long been plagued by the blue tick, from
which, on one ranch alone, 600 head of cattle had died in one year. The tick had for some years
been resistant to arsenical dips. Then benzene hexachloride was tried, and for a very short time
all seemed to be well. Reports issued early in the year 1949 declared that the arsenic-resistant
ticks could be controlled readily with the new chemical; later in the same year, a bleak notice of
developing resistance had to be published. The situation prompted a writer in the Leather
Trades Review to comment in 1950: ‘News such as this quietly trickling through scientific circles
and appearing in small sections of the overseas press is enough to make headlines as big as
those concerning the new atomic bomb if only the significance of the matter were properly
understood.’ Although insect resistance is a matter of concern in agriculture and forestry, it is in
the field of public health that the most serious apprehensions have been felt. The relation
between various insects and many diseases of man is an ancient one. Mosquitoes of the genus
Anopheles may inject into the human bloodstream the single-celled organism of malaria.
Other mosquitoes transmit yellow fever. Still others carry encephalitis. The housefly, which
does not bite, nevertheless by contact may contaminate human food with the bacillus of
dysentery, and in many parts of the world may play an important part in the transmission of
eye diseases. The list of diseases and their insect carriers, or vectors, includes typhus and body
lice, plague and rat fleas, African sleeping sickness and tsetse flies, various fevers and ticks, and
innumerable others.
These are important problems and must be met. No responsible person contends that insectborne disease should be ignored. The question that has now urgently presented itself is
whether it is either wise or responsible to attack the problem by methods that are rapidly
making it worse. The world has heard much of the triumphant war against disease through the
control of insect vectors of infection, but it has heard little of the other side of the story—the
defeats, the short-lived triumphs that now strongly support the alarming view that the insect
enemy has been made actually stronger by our efforts. Even worse, we may have destroyed our
very means of fighting. A distinguished Canadian entomologist, Dr. A. W. A. Brown, was
engaged by the World Health Organization to make a comprehensive survey of the resistance
problem. In the resulting monograph, published in 1958, Dr. Brown has this to say: ‘Barely a
decade after the introduction of the potent synthetic insecticides in public health programmes,
the main technical problem is the development of resistance to them by the insects they
formerly controlled.’ In publishing his monograph, the World Health Organization warned that
‘the vigorous offensive now being pursued against arthropodborne diseases such as malaria,
typhus fever, and plague risks a serious setback unless this new problem can be rapidly
mastered.’
What is the measure of this setback? The list of resistant species now includes practically all of
the insect groups of medical importance. Apparently the blackflies, sand flies, and tsetse flies
have not yet become resistant to chemicals. On the other hand, resistance among houseflies
and body lice has now developed on a global scale. Malaria programs are threatened by
resistance among mosquitoes. The oriental rat flea, the principal vector of plague, has recently

demonstrated resistance to DDT, a most serious development. Countries reporting resistance
among a large number of other species represent every continent and most of the island
groups.
Probably the first medical use of modern insecticides occurred in Italy in 1943 when the Allied
Military Government launched a successful attack on typhus by dusting enormous numbers of
people with DDT. This was followed two years later by extensive application of residual sprays
for the control of malaria mosquitoes. Only a year later the first signs of trouble appeared. Both
houseflies and mosquitoes of the genus Culex began to show resistance to the sprays. In 1948 a
new chemical, chlordane, was tried as a supplement to DDT. This time good control was
obtained for two years, but by August of 1950 chlordane-resistant flies appeared, and by the
end of that year all of the houseflies as well as the Culex mosquitoes seemed to be resistant to
chlordane. As rapidly as new chemicals were brought into use, resistance developed.
By the end of 1951, DDT, methoxychlor, chlordane, heptachlor, and benzene hexachloride had
joined the list of chemicals no longer effective. The flies, meanwhile, had become ‘fantastically
abundant’. The same cycle of events was being repeated in Sardinia during the late 1940s. In
Denmark, products containing DDT were first used in 1944; by 1947 fly control had failed in
many places. In some areas of Egypt, flies had already become resistant to DDT by 1948; BHC
was substituted but was effective for less than a year. One Egyptian village in particular
symbolizes the problem. Insecticides gave good control of flies in 1950 and during this same
year the infant mortality rate was reduced by nearly 50 per cent. The next year, nevertheless,
flies were resistant to DDT and chlordane. The fly population returned to its former level; so did
infant mortality.
In the United States, DDT resistance among flies had become widespread in the Tennessee
Valley by 1948. Other areas followed. Attempts to restore control with dieldrin met with little
success, for in some places the flies developed strong resistance to this chemical within only
two months. After running through all the available chlorinated hydrocarbons, control agencies
turned to the organic phosphates, but here again the story of resistance was repeated. The
present conclusion of experts is that ‘housefly control has escaped insecticidal techniques and
once more must be based on general sanitation.’ The control of body lice in Naples was one of
the earliest and most publicized achievements of DDT. During the next few years its success in
Italy was matched by the successful control of lice affecting some two million people in Japan
and Korea in the winter of 1945-46. Some premonition of trouble ahead might have been
gained by the failure to control a typhus epidemic in Spain in 1948. Despite this failure in actual
practice, encouraging laboratory experiments led entomologists to believe lice were unlikely to
develop resistance. Events in Korea in the winter of 1950-51 were therefore startling. When
DDT powder was applied to a group of Korean soldiers the extraordinary result was an actual
increase in the infestation of lice. When lice were collected and tested, it was found that 5 per
cent DDT powder caused no increase in their natural mortality rate. Similar results among lice
collected from vagrants in Tokyo, from an asylum in Itabashi, and from refugee camps in Syria,
Jordan, and eastern Egypt, confirmed the ineffectiveness of DDT for the control of lice and
typhus. When by 1957 the list of countries in which lice had become resistant to DDT was
extended to include Iran, Turkey, Ethiopia, West Africa, South Africa, Peru, Chile, France,
Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Uganda, Mexico, and Tanganyika, the initial triumph in Italy seemed
dim indeed. The first malaria mosquito to develop resistance to DDT was Anopheles sacharovi

in Greece. Extensive spraying was begun in 1946 with early success; by 1949, however,
observers noticed that adult mosquitoes were resting in large numbers under road bridges,
although they were absent from houses and stables that had been treated. Soon this habit of
outside resting was extended to caves, outbuildings, and culverts and to the foliage and trunks
of orange trees. Apparently the adult mosquitoes had become sufficiently tolerant of DDT to
escape from sprayed buildings and rest and recover in the open. A few months later they were
able to remain in houses, where they were found resting on treated walls. This was a portent of
the extremely serious situation that has now developed. Resistance to insecticides by
mosquitoes of the anophelene group has surged upward at an astounding rate, being created
by the thoroughness of the very housespraying programs designed to eliminate malaria. In
1956, only 5 species of these mosquitoes displayed resistance; by early 1960 the number had
risen from 5 to 28! The number includes very dangerous malaria vectors in West Africa, the
Middle East, Central America, Indonesia, and the eastern European region.
Among other mosquitoes, including carriers of other diseases, the pattern is being repeated. A
tropical mosquito that carries parasites responsible for such diseases as elephantiasis has
become strongly resistant in many parts of the world. In some areas of the United States the
mosquito vector of western equine encephalitis has developed resistance. An even more
serious problem concerns the vector of yellow fever, for centuries one of the great plagues of
the world. Insecticide resistant strains of this mosquito have occurred in Southeast Asia and are
now common in the Caribbean region. The consequences of resistance in terms of malaria and
other diseases are indicated by reports from many parts of the world. An outbreak of yellow
fever in Trinidad in 1954 followed failure to control the vector mosquito because of resistance.
There has been a flare-up of malaria in Indonesia and Iran. In Greece, Nigeria, and Liberia the
mosquitoes continue to harbor and transmit the malaria parasite. A reduction of diarrheal
disease achieved in Georgia through fly control was wiped out within about a year. The
reduction in acute conjunctivitis in Egypt, also attained through temporary fly control, did not
last beyond 1950.
Less serious in terms of human health, but vexatious as man measures economic values, is the
fact that salt-marsh mosquitoes in Florida also are showing resistance. Although these are not
vectors of disease, their presence in bloodthirsty swarms had rendered large areas of coastal
Florida uninhabitable until control—of an uneasy and temporary nature—was established. But
this was quickly lost. The ordinary house mosquito is here and there developing resistance, a
fact that should give pause to many communities that now regularly arrange for wholesale
spraying. This species is now resistant to several insecticides, among which is the almost
universally used DDT, in Italy, Israel, Japan, France, and parts of the United States, including
California, Ohio, New Jersey, and Massachusetts.
Ticks are another problem. The woodtick, vector of spotted fever, has recently developed
resistance; in the brown dog tick the ability to escape a chemical death has long been
thoroughly and widely established. This poses problems for human beings as well as for dogs.
The brown dog tick is a semitropical species and when it occurs as far north as New Jersey it
must live over winter in heated buildings rather than out of doors. John C. Pallister of the
American Museum of Natural History reported in the summer of 1959 that his department had
been getting a number of calls from neighboring apartments on Central Park West. ‘Every now
and then,’ Mr. Pallister said, ‘a whole apartment house gets infested with young ticks, and

they’re hard to get rid of. A dog will pick up ticks in Central Park, and then the ticks lay eggs and
they hatch in the apartment. They seem immune to DDT or chlordane or most of our modern
sprays. It used to be very unusual to have ticks in New York City, but now they’re all over here
and on Long Island, in Westchester and on up into Connecticut. We’ve noticed this particularly
in the past five or six years.’
The German cockroach throughout much of North America has become resistant to chlordane,
once the favorite weapon of exterminators who have now turned to the organic phosphates.
However, the recent development of resistance to these insecticides confronts the
exterminators with the problem of where to go next. Agencies concerned with vector-borne
disease are at present coping with their problems by switching from one insecticide to another
as resistance develops. But this cannot go on indefinitely, despite the ingenuity of the chemists
in supplying new materials. Dr. Brown has pointed out that we are traveling ‘a one-way street’.
No one knows how long the street is. If the dead end is reached before control of diseasecarrying insects is achieved, our situation will indeed be critical.
With insects that infest crops the story is the same. To the list of about a dozen agricultural
insects showing resistance to the inorganic chemicals of an earlier era there is now added a
host of others resistant to DDT, BHC, lindane, toxaphene, dieldrin, aldrin, and even to the
phosphates from which so much was hoped. The total number of resistant species among cropdestroying insects had reached 65 in 1960. The first cases of DDT resistance among agricultural
insects appeared in the United States in 1951, about six years after its first use. Perhaps the
most troublesome situation concerns the codling moth, which is now resistant to DDT in
practically all of the world’s apple-growing regions. Resistance in cabbage insects is creating
another serious problem. Potato insects are escaping chemical control in many sections of the
United States. Six species of cotton insects, along with an assortment of thrips, fruit moths, leaf
hoppers, caterpillars, mites, aphids, wireworms, and many others now are able to ignore the
farmer’s assault with chemical sprays.
The chemical industry is perhaps understandably loath to face up to the unpleasant fact of
resistance. Even in 1959, with more than 100 major insect species showing definite resistance
to chemicals, one of the leading journals in the field of agricultural chemistry spoke of ‘real or
imagined’ insect resistance. Yet hopefully as the industry may turn its face the other way, the
problem simply does not go away, and it presents some unpleasant economic facts. One is that
the cost of insect control by chemicals is increasing steadily. It is no longer possible to stockpile
materials well in advance; what today may be the most promising of insecticidal chemicals may
be the dismal failure of tomorrow. The very substantial financial investment involved in backing
and launching an insecticide may be swept away as the insects prove once more that the
effective approach to nature is not through brute force. And however rapidly technology may
invent new uses for insecticides and new ways of applying them, it is likely to find the insects
keeping a lap ahead. . . .
Darwin himself could scarcely have found a better example of the operation of natural selection
than is provided by the way the mechanism of resistance operates. Out of an original
population, the members of which vary greatly in qualities of structure, behavior, or physiology,
it is the ‘tough’ insects that survive chemical attack. Spraying kills off the weaklings. The only
survivors are insects that have some inherent quality that allows them to escape harm. These
are the parents of the new generation, which, by simple inheritance, possesses all the qualities

of ‘toughness’ inherent in its forebears. Inevitably it follows that intensive spraying with
powerful chemicals only makes worse the problem it is designed to solve. After a few
generations, instead of a mixed population of strong and weak insects, there results a
population consisting entirely of tough, resistant strains.
The means by which insects resist chemicals probably vary and as yet are not thoroughly
understood. Some of the insects that defy chemical control are thought to be aided by a
structural advantage, hut there seems to be little actual proof of this. That immunity exists in
some strains is clear, however, from observations like those of Dr. Briejèr, who reports
watching flies at the Pest Control Institute at Springforbi, Denmark, ‘disporting themselves in
DDT as much at home as primitive sorcerers cavorting over red-hot coals.’ Similar reports come
from other parts of the world. In Malaya, at Kuala Lumpur, mosquitoes at first reacted to DDT
by leaving the treated interiors. As resistance developed, however, they could be found at rest
on surfaces where the deposit of DDT beneath them was clearly visible by torchlight. And in an
army camp in southern Taiwan samples of resistant bedbugs were found actually carrying a
deposit of DDT powder on their bodies. When these bedbugs were experimentally placed in
cloth impregnated with DDT, they lived for as long as a month; they proceeded to lay their
eggs; and the resulting young grew and thrived.
Nevertheless, the quality of resistance does not necessarily depend on physical structure. DDTresistant flies possess an enzyme that allows them to detoxify the insecticide to the less toxic
chemical DDE. This enzyme occurs only in flies that possess a genetic factor for DDT resistance.
This factor is, of course, hereditary. How flies and other insects detoxify the organic phosphorus
chemicals is less clearly understood. Some behavioral habit may also place the insect out of
reach of chemicals. Many workers have noticed the tendency of resistant flies to rest more on
untreated horizontal surfaces than on treated walls. Resistant houseflies may have the stablefly habit of sitting still in one place, this greatly reducing the frequency of their contact with
residues of poison. Some malaria mosquitoes have a habit that so reduces their exposure to
DDT as to make them virtually immune. Irritated by the spray, they leave the huts and survive
outside. Ordinarily resistance takes two or three years to develop, although occasionally it will
do so in only one season, or even less. At the other extreme it may take as long as six years. The
number of generations produced by an insect population in a year is important, and this varies
with species and climate. Flies in Canada, for example, have been slower to develop resistance
than those in southern United States, where long hot summers favor a rapid rate of
reproduction.
The hopeful question is sometimes asked, ‘If insects can become resistant to chemicals, could
human beings do the same thing?’ Theoretically they could; but since this would take hundreds
or even thousands of years, the comfort to those living now is slight. Resistance is not
something that develops in an individual. If he possesses at birth some qualities that make him
less susceptible than others to poisons he is more likely to survive and produce children.
Resistance, therefore, is something that develops in a population after time measured in
several or many generations. Human populations reproduce at the rate of roughly three
generations per century, but new insect generations arise in a matter of days or weeks.
‘It is more sensible in some cases to take a small amount of damage in preference to having
one for a time but paying for it in the long run by losing the very means of fighting,’ is the
advice given in Holland by Dr. Briejèr in his capacity as director of the Plant Protection Service.

‘Practical advice should be “Spray as little as you possibly can” rather than “Spray to the limit of
your capacity.”...Pressure on the pest population should always be as slight as possible.’
Unfortunately, such vision has not prevailed in the corresponding agricultural services of the
United States. The Department of Agriculture’s Yearbook for 1952, devoted entirely to insects,
recognizes the fact that insects become resistant but says, ‘More applications or greater
quantities of the insecticides are needed then for adequate control.’ The Department does not
say what will happen when the only chemicals left untried are those that render the earth not
only insectless but lifeless. But in 1959, only seven years after this advice was given, a
Connecticut entomologist was quoted in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry to the
effect that on at least one or two insect pests the last available new material was then being
used. Dr. Briejèr says: It is more than clear that we are traveling a dangerous road. ...We are
going to have to do some very energetic research on other control measures, measures that will
have to be biological, not chemical. Our aim should be to guide natural processes as cautiously
as possible in the desired direction rather than to use brute force...
We need a more high-minded orientation and a deeper insight, which I miss in many
researchers. Life is a miracle beyond our comprehension, and we should reverence it even
where we have to struggle against it...The resort to weapons such as insecticides to control it is
a proof of insufficient knowledge and of an incapacity so to guide the processes of nature that
brute force becomes unnecessary. Humbleness is in order; there is no excuse for scientific
conceit here.

17. The Other Road
WE STAND NOW where two roads diverge. But unlike the roads in Robert Frost’s
familiar poem, they are not equally fair. The road we have long been traveling is deceptively
easy, a smooth superhighway on which we progress with great speed, but at its end lies
disaster. The other fork of the road—the one ‘less traveled by’—offers our last, our only chance
to reach a destination that assures the preservation of our earth.
The choice, after all, is ours to make. If, having endured much, we have at last asserted our
‘right to know’, and if, knowing, we have concluded that we are being asked to take senseless
and frightening risks, then we should no longer accept the counsel of those who tell us that we
must fill our world with poisonous chemicals; we should look about and see what other course
is open to us. A truly extraordinary variety of alternatives to the chemical control of insects is
available. Some are already in use and have achieved brilliant success. Others are in the stage
of laboratory testing. Still others are little more than ideas in the minds of imaginative
scientists, waiting for the opportunity to put them to the test. All have this in common: they are
biological solutions, based on understanding of the living organisms they seek to control, and of
the whole fabric of life to which these organisms belong. Specialists representing various areas
of the vast field of biology are contributing— entomologists, pathologists, geneticists,
physiologists, biochemists, ecologists—all pouring their knowledge and their creative
inspirations into the formation of a new science of biotic controls.
‘Any science may be likened to a river,’ says a Johns Hopkins biologist, Professor Carl P.
Swanson. ‘It has its obscure and unpretentious beginning; its quiet stretches as well as its
rapids; its periods of drought as well as of fullness. It gathers momentum with the work of
many investigators and as it is fed by other streams of thought; it is deepened and broadened
by the concepts and generalizations that are gradually evolved.’
So it is with the science of biological control in its modern sense. In America it had its obscure
beginnings a century ago with the first attempts to introduce natural enemies of insects that
were proving troublesome to farmers, an effort that sometimes moved slowly or not at all, but
now and again gathered speed and momentum under the impetus of an outstanding success. It
had its period of drought when workers in applied entomology, dazzled by the spectacular new
insecticides of the 1940s, turned their backs on all biological methods and set foot on ‘the
treadmill of chemical control’. But the goal of an insect-free world continued to recede. Now at
last, as it has become apparent that the heedless and unrestrained use of chemicals is a greater
menace to ourselves than to the targets, the river which is the science of biotic control flows
again, fed by new streams of thought.
Some of the most fascinating of the new methods are those that seek to turn the strength of a
species against itself—to use the drive of an insect’s life forces to destroy it. The most
spectacular of these approaches is the ‘male sterilization’ technique developed by the chief of
the United States Department of Agriculture’s Entomology Research Branch, Dr. Edward
Knipling, and his associates. About a quarter of a century ago Dr. Knipling startled his colleagues
by proposing a unique method of insect control. If it were possible to sterilize and release large
numbers of insects, he theorized, the sterilized males would, under certain conditions, compete

with the normal wild males so successfully that, after repeated releases, only infertile eggs
would be produced and the population would die out.
The proposal was met with bureaucratic inertia and with skepticism from scientists, but the
idea persisted in Dr. Knipling’s mind. One major problem remained to be solved before it could
be put to the test—a practical method of insect sterilization had to be found. Academically, the
fact that insects could be sterilized by exposure to X-ray had been known since 1916, when an
entomologist by the name of G. A. Runner reported such sterilization of cigarette beetles.
Hermann Muller’s pioneering work on the production of mutations by X-ray opened up vast
new areas of thought in the late 1920s, and by the middle of the century various workers had
reported the sterilization by X-rays or gamma rays of at least a dozen species of insects.
But these were laboratory experiments, still a long way from practical application. About 1950,
Dr. Knipling launched a serious effort to turn insect sterilization into a weapon that would wipe
out a major insect enemy of livestock in the South, the screw-worm fly. The females of this
species lay their eggs in any open wound of a warm-blooded animal. The hatching larvae are
parasitic, feeding on the flesh of the host. A full-grown steer may succumb to a heavy
infestation in 10 days, and livestock losses in the United States have been estimated at
$40,000,000 a year. The toll of wildlife is harder to measure, but it must be great. Scarcity of
deer in some areas of Texas is attributed to the screw-worm. This is a tropical or sub-tropical
insect, inhabiting South and Central America and Mexico, and in the United States normally
restricted to the Southwest. About 1933, however, it was accidentally introduced into Florida,
where the climate allowed it to survive over winter and to establish populations. It even pushed
into southern Alabama and Georgia, and soon the livestock industry of the southeastern states
was faced with annual losses running to $20,000,000.
A vast amount of information on the biology of the screw-worm had been accumulated over
the years by Agriculture Department scientists in Texas. By 1954, after some preliminary field
trials on Florida islands, Dr. Knipling was ready for a full-scale test of his theory. For this, by
arrangement with the Dutch Government, he went to the island of Curaçao in the Caribbean,
cut off from the mainland by at least 50 miles of sea. Beginning in August 1954, screw-worms
reared and sterilized in an Agriculture Department laboratory in Florida were flown to Curaçao
and released from airplanes at the rate of about 400 per square mile per week. Almost at once
the number of egg masses deposited on experimental goats began to decrease, as did their
fertility. Only seven weeks after the releases were started, all eggs were infertile. Soon it was
impossible to find a single egg mass, sterile or otherwise. The screw-worm had indeed been
eradicated on Curaçao. The resounding success of the Curaçao experiment whetted the
appetites of Florida livestock raisers for a similar feat that would relieve them of the scourge of
screw-worms. Although the difficulties here were relatively enormous—an area 300 times as
large as the small Caribbean island—in 1957 the United States Department of Agriculture and
the State of Florida joined in providing funds for an eradication effort. The project involved the
weekly production of about 50 million screw-worms at a specially constructed ‘fly factory’, the
use of 20 light airplanes to fly prearranged flight patterns, five to six hours daily, each plane
carrying a thousand paper cartons, each carton containing 200 to 400 irradiated flies.
The cold winter of 1957-58, when freezing temperatures gripped northern Florida, gave an
unexpected opportunity to start the program while the screw-worm populations were reduced
and confined to a small area. By the time the program was considered complete at the end of

17 months, 3½ billion artificially reared, sterilized flies had been released over Florida and
sections of Georgia and Alabama. The last-known animal wound infestation that could be
attributed to screwworms occurred in February 1959. In the next few weeks several adults
were taken in traps. Thereafter no trace of the screwworm could be discovered. Its extinction in
the Southeast had been accomplished—a triumphant demonstration of the worth of scientific
creativity, aided by thorough basic research, persistence, and determination.
Now a quarantine barrier in Mississippi seeks to prevent the re-entrance of the screw-worm
from the Southwest, where it is firmly entrenched. Eradication there would be a formidable
undertaking, considering the vast areas involved and the probability of re-invasion from
Mexico. Nevertheless, the stakes are high and the thinking in the Department seems to be that
some sort of program, designed at least to hold the screw-worm populations at very low levels,
may soon be attempted in Texas and other infested areas of the Southwest. . . .
The brilliant success of the screw-worm campaign has stimulated tremendous interest in
applying the same methods to other insects. Not all, of course, are suitable subjects for this
technique, much depending on details of the life history, population density, and reactions to
radiation. Experiments have been undertaken by the British in the hope that the method could
be used against the tsetse fly in Rhodesia. This insect infests about a third of Africa, posing a
menace to human health and preventing the keeping of livestock in an area of some 4½ million
square miles of wooded grasslands. The habits of the tsetse differ considerably from those of
the screw-worm fly, and although it can be sterilized by radiation some technical difficulties
remain to be worked out before the method can be applied.
The British have already tested a large number of other species for susceptibility to radiation.
United States scientists have had some encouraging early results with the melon fly and the
oriental and Mediterranean fruit flies in laboratory tests in Hawaii and field tests on the remote
island of Rota. The corn borer and the sugarcane borer are also being tested. There are
possibilities, too, that insects of medical importance might be controlled by sterilization. A
Chilean scientist has pointed out that malaria-carrying mosquitoes persist in his country in spite
of insecticide treatment; the release of sterile males might then provide the final blow needed
to eliminate this population.
The obvious difficulties of sterilizing by radiation have led to search for an easier method of
accomplishing similar results, and there is now a strongly running tide of interest in chemical
sterilants. Scientists at the Department of Agriculture laboratory in Orlando, Florida, are now
sterilizing the housefly in laboratory experiments and even in some field trials, using chemicals
incorporated in suitable foods. In a test on an island in the Florida Keys in 1961, a population of
flies was nearly wiped out within a period of only five weeks. Repopulation of course followed
from nearby islands, but as a pilot project the test was successful. The Department’s
excitement about the promise of this method is easily understood. In the first place, as we have
seen, the housefly has now become virtually uncontrollable by insecticides. A completely new
method of control is undoubtedly needed. One of the problems of sterilization by radiation is
that this requires not only artificial rearing but the release of sterile males in larger number
than are present in the wild population. This could be done with the screw-worm, which is
actually not an abundant insect. With the housefly, however, more than doubling the
population through releases could be highly objectionable, even though the increase would be
only temporary. A chemical sterilant, on the other hand, could be combined with a bait

substance and introduced into the natural environment of the fly; insects feeding on it would
become sterile and in the course of time the sterile flies would predominate and the insects
would breed themselves out of existence. The testing of chemicals for a sterilizing effect is
much more difficult than the testing of chemical poisons. It takes 30 days to evaluate one
chemical—although, of course, a number of tests can be run concurrently. Yet between April
1958 and December 1961 several hundred chemicals were screened at the Orlando laboratory
for a possible sterilizing effect.
The Department of Agriculture seems happy to have found among these even a handful of
chemicals that show promise. Now other laboratories of the Department are taking up the
problem, testing chemicals against stable flies, mosquitoes, boll weevils, and an assortment of
fruit flies. All this is presently experimental but in the few years since work began on
chemosterilants the project has grown enormously. In theory it has many attractive features.
Dr. Knipling has pointed out that effective chemical insect sterilization ‘might easily outdo some
of the best of known insecticides.’ Take an imaginary situation in which a population of a
million insects is multiplying five times in each generation. An insecticide might kill 90 per cent
of each generation, leaving 125,000 insects alive after the third generation. In contrast, a
chemical that would produce 90 per cent sterility would leave only 125 insects alive.
On the other side of the coin is the fact that some extremely potent chemicals are involved. It is
fortunate that at least during these early stages most of the men working with chemosterilants
seem mindful of the need to find safe chemicals and safe methods of application. Nonetheless,
suggestions are heard here and there that these sterilizing chemicals might be applied as aerial
sprays—for example, to coat the foliage chewed by gypsy moth larvae. To attempt any such
procedure without thorough advance research on the hazards involved would be the height of
irresponsibility. If the potential hazards of the chemosterilants are not constantly borne in mind
we could easily find ourselves in even worse trouble than that now created by the insecticides.
The sterilants currently being tested fall generally into two groups, both of which are extremely
interesting in their mode of action. The first are intimately related to the life processes, or
metabolism, of the cell; i.e., they so closely resemble a substance the cell or tissue needs that
the organism ‘mistakes’ them for the true metabolite and tries to incorporate them in its
normal building processes. But the fit is wrong in some detail and the process comes to a halt.
Such chemicals are called antimetabolites.
The second group consists of chemicals that act on the chromosomes, probably affecting the
gene chemicals and causing the chromosomes to break up. The chemosterilants of this group
are alkylating agents, which are extremely reactive chemicals, capable of intense cell
destruction, damage to chromosomes, and production of mutations. It is the view of Dr. Peter
Alexander of the Chester Beatty Research Institute in London that ‘any alkylating agent which is
effective in sterilizing insects would also be a powerful mutagen and carcinogen.’ Dr. Alexander
feels that any conceivable use of such chemicals in insect control would be ‘open to the most
severe objections’. It is to be hoped, therefore, that the present experiments will lead not to
actual use of these particular chemicals but to the discovery of others that will be safe and also
highly specific in their action on the target insect. . . .
Some of the most interesting of the recent work is concerned with still other ways of forging
weapons from the insect’s own life processes. Insects produce a variety of venoms, attractants,
repellents. What is the chemical nature of these secretions? Could we make use of them as,

perhaps, very selective insecticides? Scientists at Cornell University and elsewhere are trying to
find answers to some of these questions, studying the defense mechanisms by which many
insects protect themselves from attack by predators, working out the chemical structure of
insect secretions. Other scientists are working on the so-called ‘juvenile hormone’, a powerful
substance which prevents metamorphosis of the larval insect until the proper stage of growth
has been reached.
Perhaps the most immediately useful result of this exploration of insect secretion is the
development of lures, or attractants. Here again, nature has pointed the way. The gypsy moth
is an especially intriguing example. The female moth is too heavy-bodied to fly. She lives on or
near the ground, fluttering about among low vegetation or creeping up tree trunks. The male,
on the contrary, is a strong flier and is attracted even from considerable distances by a scent
released by the female from special glands. Entomologists have taken advantage of this fact for
a good many years, laboriously preparing this sex attractant from the bodies of the female
moths. It was then used in traps set for the males in census operations along the fringe of the
insect’s range. But this was an extremely expensive procedure. Despite the much publicized
infestations in the northeastern states, there were not enough gypsy moths to provide the
material, and handcollected female pupae had to be imported from Europe, sometimes at a
cost of half a dollar per tip. It was a tremendous breakthrough, therefore, when, after years of
effort, chemists of the Agriculture Department recently succeeded in isolating the attractant.
Following upon this discovery was the successful preparation of a closely related synthetic
material from a constituent of castor oil; this not only deceives the male moths but is
apparently fully as attractive as the natural substance.
As little as one microgram (1/1,000,000 gram) in a trap is an effective lure. All this is of much
more than academic interest, for the new and economical ‘gyplure’ might be used not merely in
census operations but in control work. Several of the more attractive possibilities are now being
tested. In what might be termed an experiment in psychological warfare, the attractant is
combined with a granular material and distributed by planes. The aim is to confuse the male
moth and alter the normal behavior so that, in the welter of attractive scents, he cannot find
the true scent trail leading to the female. This line of attack is being carried even further in
experiments aimed at deceiving the male into attempting to mate with a spurious female. In
the laboratory, male gypsy moths have attempted copulation with chips of wood, vermiculite,
and other small, inanimate objects, so long as they were suitably impregnated with gyplure.
Whether such diversion of the mating instinct into nonproductive channels would actually serve
to reduce the population remains to be tested, but it is an interesting possibility.
The gypsy moth lure was the first insect sex attractant to be synthesized, but probably there
will soon be others. A number of agricultural insects are being studied for possible attractants
that man could imitate. Encouraging results have been obtained with the Hessian fly and the
tobacco hornworm. Combinations of attractants and poisons are being tried against several
insect species. Government scientists have developed an attractant called methyl-eugenol,
which males of the oriental fruit fly and the melon fly find irresistible. This has been combined
with a poison in tests in the Bonin Islands 450 miles south of Japan. Small pieces of fiberboard
were impregnated with the two chemicals and were distributed by air over the entire island
chain to attract and kill the male flies. This program of ‘male annihilation’ was begun in 1960: a
year later the Agriculture Department estimated that more than 99 per cent of the population

had been eliminated. The method as here applied seems to have marked advantages over the
conventional broadcasting of insecticides. The poison, an organic phosphorus chemical, is
confined to squares of fiberboard which are unlikely to be eaten by wildlife; its residues,
moreover, are quickly dissipated and so are not potential contaminants of soil or water.
But not all communication in the insect world is by scents that lure or repel. Sound also may be
a warning or an attraction. The constant stream of ultrasonic sound that issues from a bat in
flight (serving as a radar system to guide it through darkness) is heard by certain moths,
enabling them to avoid capture. The wing sounds of approaching parasitic flies warn the larvae
of some sawflies to herd together for protection. On the other hand, the sounds made by
certain wood-boring insects enable their parasites to find them, and to the male mosquito the
wingbeat of the female is a siren song.
What use, if any, can be made of this ability of the insect to detect and react to sound? As yet in
the experimental stage, but nonetheless interesting, is the initial success in attracting male
mosquitoes to playback recordings of the flight sound of the female. The males were lured to a
charged grid and so killed. The repellent effect of bursts of ultrasonic sound is being tested in
Canada against corn borer and cutworm moths. Two authorities on animal sound, Professors
Hubert and Mable Frings of the University of Hawaii, believe that a field method of influencing
the behavior of insects with sound only awaits discovery of the proper key to unlock and apply
the vast existing knowledge of insect sound production and reception. Repellent sounds may
offer greater possibilities than attractants. The Fringses are known for their discovery that
starlings scatter in alarm before a recording of the distress cry of one of their fellows; perhaps
somewhere in this fact is a central truth that may be applied to insects. To practical men of
industry the possibilities seem real enough so that at least one major electronic corporation is
preparing to set up a laboratory to test them.
Sound is also being tested as an agent of direct destruction. Ultrasonic sound will kill all
mosquito larvae in a laboratory tank; however, it kills other aquatic organisms as well. In other
experiments, blowflies, mealworms, and yellow fever mosquitoes have been killed by airborne
ultrasonic sound in a matter of seconds. All such experiments are first steps toward wholly new
concepts of insect control which the miracles of electronics may some day make a reality. . . .
The new biotic control of insects is not wholly a matter of electronics and gamma radiation and
other products of man’s inventive mind. Some of its methods have ancient roots, based on the
knowledge that, like ourselves, insects are subject to disease. Bacterial infections sweep
through their populations like the plagues of old; under the onset of a virus their hordes sicken
and die. The occurrence of disease in insects was known before the time of Aristotle; the
maladies of the silkworm were celebrated in medieval poetry; and through study of the
diseases of this same insect the first understanding of the principles of infectious disease came
to Pasteur. Insects are beset not only by viruses and bacteria but also by fungi, protozoa,
microscopic worms, and other beings from all that unseen world of minute life that, by and
large, befriends mankind. For the microbes include not only disease organisms but those that
destroy waste matter, make soils fertile, and enter into countless biological processes like
fermentation and nitrification. Why should they not also aid us in the control of insects? One of
the first to envision such use of microorganisms was the 19th-century zoologist Elie
Metchnikoff. During the concluding decades of the 19th and the first half of the 20th centuries
the idea of microbial control was slowly taking form. The first conclusive proof that an insect

could be brought under control by introducing a disease into its environment came in the late
1930s with the discovery and use of milky disease for the Japanese beetle, which is caused by
the spores of a bacterium belonging to the genus Bacillus. This classic example of bacterial
control has a long history of use in the eastern part of the United States, as I have pointed out
in Chapter 7.
High hopes now attend tests of another bacterium of this genus—Bacillus thuringiensis—
originally discovered in Germany in 1911 in the province of Thuringia, where it was found to
cause a fatal septicemia in the larvae of the flour moth. This bacterium actually kills by
poisoning rather than by disease. Within its vegetative rods there are formed, along with
spores, peculiar crystals composed of a protein substance highly toxic to certain insects,
especially to the larvae of the mothlike lepidopteras. Shortly after eating foliage coated with
this toxin the larva suffers paralysis, stops feeding, and soon dies. For practical purposes, the
fact that feeding is interrupted promptly is of course an enormous advantage, for crop damage
stops almost as soon as the pathogen is applied. Compounds containing spores of Bacillus
thuringiensis are now being manufactured by several firms in the United States under various
trade names. Field tests are being made in several countries: in France and Germany against
larvae of the cabbage butterfly, in Yugoslavia against the fall webworm, in the Soviet Union
against a tent caterpillar. In Panama, where tests were begun in 1961, this bacterial insecticide
may be the answer to one or more of the serious problems confronting banana growers. There
the root borer is a serious pest of the banana, so weakening its roots that the trees are easily
toppled by wind. Dieldrin has been the only chemical effective against the borer, but it has now
set in motion a chain of disaster. The borers are becoming resistant. The chemical has also
destroyed some important insect predators and so has caused an increase in the tortricids—
small, stout-bodied moths whose larvae scar the surface of the bananas. There is reason to
hope the new microbial insecticide will eliminate both the tortricids and the borers and that it
will do so without upsetting natural controls.
In eastern forests of Canada and the United States bacterial insecticides may be one important
answer to the problems of such forest insects as the budworms and the gypsy moth. In 1960
both countries began field tests with a commercial preparation of Bacillus thuringiensis. Some
of the early results have been encouraging. In Vermont, for example, the end results of
bacterial control were as good as those obtained with DDT. The main technical problem now is
to find a carrying solution that will stick the bacterial spores to the needles of the evergreens.
On crops this is not a problem—even a dust can be used. Bacterial insecticides have already
been tried on a wide variety of vegetables, especially in California. Meanwhile, other perhaps
less spectacular work is concerned with viruses. Here and there in California fields of young
alfalfa are being sprayed with a substance as deadly as any insecticide for the destructive alfalfa
caterpillar—a solution containing a virus obtained from the bodies of caterpillars that have died
because of infection with this exceedingly virulent disease. The bodies of only five diseased
caterpillars provide enough virus to treat an acre of alfalfa. In some Canadian forests a virus
that affects pine sawflies has proved so effective in control that it has replaced insecticides.
Scientists in Czechoslovakia are experimenting with protozoa against webworms and other
insect pests, and in the United States a protozoan parasite has been found to reduce the
egglaying potential of the corn borer. To some the term microbial insecticide may conjure up
pictures of bacterial warfare that would endanger other forms of life. This is not true. In

contrast to chemicals, insect pathogens are harmless to all but their intended targets. Dr.
Edward Steinhaus, an outstanding authority on insect pathology, has stated emphatically that
there is ‘no authenticated recorded instance of a true insect pathogen having caused an
infectious disease in a vertebrate animal either experimentally or in nature.’
The insect pathogens are so specific that they infect only a small group of insects—sometimes a
single species. Biologically they do not belong to the type of organisms that cause disease in
higher animals or in plants. Also, as Dr. Steinhaus points out, outbreaks of insect disease in
nature always remain confined to insects, affecting neither the host plants nor animals feeding
on them. Insects have many natural enemies—not only microbes of many kinds but other
insects. The first suggestion that an insect might be controlled by encouraging its enemies is
generally credited to Erasmus Darwin about 1800. Probably because it was the first generally
practiced method of biological control, this setting of one insect against another is widely but
erroneously thought to be the only alternative to chemicals. In the United States the true
beginnings of conventional biological control date from 1888 when Albert Koebele, the first of a
growing army of entomologist explorers, went to Australia to search for natural enemies of the
cottony cushion scale that threatened the California citrus industry with destruction. As we
have seen in Chapter 15, the mission was crowned with spectacular success, and in the century
that followed the world has been combed for natural enemies to control the insects that have
come uninvited to our shores. In all, about 100 species of imported predators and parasites
have become established. Besides the vedalia beetles brought in by Koebele, other
importations have been highly successful. A wasp imported from Japan established complete
control of an insect attacking eastern apple orchards. Several natural enemies of the spotted
alfalfa aphid, an accidental import from the Middle East, are credited with saving the California
alfalfa industry. Parasites and predators of the gypsy moth achieved good control, as did the
Tiphia wasp against the Japanese beetle. Biological control of scales and mealy bugs is
estimated to save California several millions of dollars a year—indeed, one of the leading
entomologists of that state, Dr. Paul DeBach, has estimated that for an investment of
$4,000,000 in biological control work California has received a return of $100,000,000.
Examples of successful biological control of serious pests by importing their natural enemies are
to be found in some 40 countries distributed over much of the world. The advantages of such
control over chemicals are obvious: it is relatively inexpensive, it is permanent, it leaves no
poisonous residues. Yet biological control has suffered from lack of support. California is
virtually alone among the states in having a formal program in biological control, and many
states have not even one entomologist who devotes full time to it. Perhaps for want of support
biological control through insect enemies has not always been carried out with the scientific
thoroughness it requires—exacting studies of its impact on the populations of insect prey have
seldom been made, and releases have not always been made with the precision that might
spell the difference between success and failure.
The predator and the preyed upon exist not alone, but as part of a vast web of life, all of which
needs to be taken into account. Perhaps the opportunities for the more conventional types of
biological control are greatest in the forests. The farmlands of modern agriculture are highly
artificial, unlike anything nature ever conceived. But the forests are a different world, much
closer to natural environments. Here, with a minimum of help and a maximum of

noninterference from man, Nature can have her way, setting up all that wonderful and intricate
system of checks and balances that protects the forest from undue damage by insects.
In the United States our foresters seem to have thought of biological control chiefly in terms of
introducing insect parasites and predators. The Canadians take a broader view, and some of the
Europeans have gone farthest of all to develop the science of ‘forest hygiene’ to an amazing
extent. Birds, ants, forest spiders, and soil bacteria are as much a part of a forest as the trees, in
the view of European foresters, who take care to inoculate a new forest with these protective
factors. The encouragement of birds is one of the first steps. In the modern era of intensive
forestry the old hollow trees are gone and with them homes for woodpeckers and other treenesting birds. This lack is met by nesting boxes, which draw the birds back into the forest. Other
boxes are specially designed for owls and for bats, so that these creatures may take over in the
dark hours the work of insect hunting performed in daylight by the small birds.
But this is only the beginning. Some of the most fascinating control work in European forests
employs the forest red ant as an aggressive insect predator—a species which, unfortunately,
does not occur in North America. About 25 years ago Professor Karl Gösswald of the University
of Würzburg developed a method of cultivating this ant and establishing colonies. Under his
direction more than 10,000 colonies of the red ant have been established in about 90 test areas
in the German Federal Republic. Dr. Gösswald’s method has been adopted in Italy and other
countries, where ant farms have been established to supply colonies for distribution in the
forests. In the Apennines, for example, several hundred nests have been set out to protect
reforested areas. ‘Where you can obtain in your forest a combination of birds’ and ants’
protection together with some bats and owls, the biological equilibrium has already been
essentially improved,’ says Dr. Heinz Ruppertshofen, a forestry officer in Mölln, Germany, who
believes that a single introduced predator or parasite is less effective than an array of the
‘natural companions’ of the trees.
New ant colonies in the forests at Mölln are protected from woodpeckers by wire netting to
reduce the toll. In this way the woodpeckers, which have increased by 400 per cent in 10 years
in some of the test areas, do not seriously reduce the ant colonies, and pay handsomely for
what they take by picking harmful caterpillars off the trees. Much of the work of caring for the
ant colonies (and the birds’ nesting boxes as well) is assumed by a youth corps from the local
school, children 10 to 14 years old. The costs are exceedingly low; the benefits amount to
permanent protection of the forests. Another extremely interesting feature of Dr.
Ruppertshofen’s work is his use of spiders, in which he appears to be a pioneer. Although there
is a large literature on the classification and natural history of spiders, it is scattered and
fragmentary and deals not at all with their value as an agent of biological control. Of the 22,000
known kinds of spiders, 760 are native to Germany (and about 2000 to the United States).
Twenty-nine families of spiders inhabit German forests. To a forester the most important fact
about a spider is the kind of net it builds. The wheel-net spiders are most important, for the
webs of some of them are so narrow-meshed that they can catch all flying insects. A large web
(up to 16 inches in diameter) of the cross spider bears some 120,000 adhesive nodules on its
strands. A single spider may destroy in her life of 18 months an average of 2000 insects. A
biologically sound forest has 50 to 150 spiders to the square meter (a little more than a square
yard). Where there are fewer, the deficiency may be remedied by collecting and distributing the
baglike cocoons containing the eggs. ‘Three cocoons of the wasp spider [which occurs also in

America] yield a thousand spiders, which can catch 200,000 flying insects,’ says Dr.
Ruppertshofen. The tiny and delicate young of the wheel-net spiders that emerge in the spring
are especially important, he says, ‘as they spin in a teamwork a net umbrella above the top
shoots of the trees and thus protect the young shoots against the flying insects.’ As the spiders
molt and grow, the net is enlarged.
Canadian biologists have pursued rather similar lines of investigation, although with differences
dictated by the fact that North American forests are largely natural rather than planted, and
that the species available as aids in maintaining a healthy forest are somewhat different. The
emphasis in Canada is on small mammals, which are amazingly effective in the control of
certain insects, especially those that live within the spongy soil of the forest floor. Among such
insects are the sawflies, so-called because the female has a saw-shaped ovipositor with which
she slits open the needles of evergreen trees in order to deposit her eggs. The larvae eventually
drop to the ground and form cocoons in the peat of tamarack bogs or the duff under spruce or
pines. But beneath the forest floor is a world honeycombed with the tunnels and runways of
small mammals—whitefooted mice, voles, and shrews of various species. Of all these small
burrowers, the voracious shrews find and consume the largest number of sawfly cocoons. They
feed by placing a forefoot on the cocoon and biting off the end, showing an extraordinary
ability to discriminate between sound and empty cocoons. And for their insatiable appetite the
shrews have no rivals. Whereas a vole can consume about 200 cocoons a day, a shrew,
depending on the species, may devour up to 800! This may result, according to laboratory tests,
in destruction of 75 to 98 per cent of the cocoons present.
It is not surprising that the island of Newfoundland, which has no native shrews but is beset
with sawflies, so eagerly desired some of these small, efficient mammals that in 1958 the
introduction of the masked shrew—the most efficient sawfly predator—was attempted.
Canadian officials report in 1962 that the attempt has been successful. The shrews are
multiplying and are spreading out over the island, some marked individuals having been
recovered as much as ten miles from the point of release.
There is, then, a whole battery of armaments available to the forester who is willing to look for
permanent solutions that preserve and strengthen the natural relations in the forest. Chemical
pest control in the forest is at best a stopgap measure bringing no real solution, at worst killing
the fishes in the forest streams, bringing on plagues of insects, and destroying the natural
controls and those we may be trying to introduce. By such violent measures, says Dr.
Ruppertshofen, ‘the partnership for life of the forest is entirely being unbalanced, and the
catastrophes caused by parasites repeat in shorter and shorter periods...We, therefore, have to
put an end to these unnatural manipulations brought into the most important and almost last
natural living space which has been left for us.’ . . .
Through all these new, imaginative, and creative approaches to the problem of sharing our
earth with other creatures there runs a constant theme, the awareness that we are dealing
with life—with living populations and all their pressures and counter-pressures, their surges
and recessions. Only by taking account of such life forces and by cautiously seeking to guide
them into channels favorable to ourselves can we hope to achieve a reasonable
accommodation between the insect hordes and ourselves.
The current vogue for poisons has failed utterly to take into account these most fundamental
considerations. As crude a weapon as the cave man’s club, the chemical barrage has been

hurled against the fabric of life—a fabric on the one hand delicate and destructible, on the
other miraculously tough and resilient, and capable of striking back in unexpected ways. These
extraordinary capacities of life have been ignored by the practitioners of chemical control who
have brought to their task no ‘high-minded orientation’, no humility before the vast forces with
which they tamper. The ‘control of nature’ is a phrase conceived in arrogance, born of the
Neanderthal age of biology and philosophy, when it was supposed that nature exists for the
convenience of man. The concepts and practices of applied entomology for the most part date
from that Stone Age of science. It is our alarming misfortune that so primitive a science has
armed itself with the most modern and terrible weapons, and that in turning them against the
insects it has also turned them against the earth.
