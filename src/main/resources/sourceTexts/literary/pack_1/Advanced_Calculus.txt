PREFACE
This book is based on an honors course in advanced calculus that we gave in the
1960's. The foundational material, presented in the unstarred sections of Chapters 1 through 11, was normally covered, but different applications of this basic
material were stressed from year to year, and the book therefore contains more
material than was covered in anyone year. It can accordingly be used (with
omissions) as a text for a year's course in advanced calculus, or as a text for a
three-semester introduction to analysis.
These prerequisites are a good grounding in the calculus of one variable
from a mathematically rigorous point of view, together with some acquaintance
with linear algebra. The reader should be familiar with limit and continuity type
arguments and have a certain amount of mathematical sophistication. AB possible introductory texts, we mention Differential and Integral Calculus by R. Courant, Calculus by T. Apostol, Calculus by M. Spivak, and Pure Mathematics by
G. Hardy. The reader should also have some experience with partial derivatives.
In overall plan the book divides roughly into a first half which develops the
calculus (principally the differential calculus) in the setting of normed vector
spaces, and a second half which deals with the calculus of differentiable manifolds.
Vector space calculus is treated in two chapters, the differential calculus in
Chapter 3, and the basic theory of ordinary differential equations in Chapter 6.
The other early chapters are auxiliary. The first two chapters develop the necessary purely algebraic theory of vector spaces, Chapter 4 presents the material
on compactness and completeness needed for the more substantive results of
the calculus, and Chapter 5 contains a brief account of the extra structure encountered in scalar product spaces. Chapter 7 is devoted to multilinear (tensor)
algebra and is, in the main, a reference chapter for later use. Chapter 8 deals
with the theory of (Riemann) integration on Euclidean spaces and includes (in
exercise form) the fundamental facts about the Fourier transform. Chapters 9
and 10 develop the differential and integral calculus on manifolds, while Chapter
11 treats the exterior calculus of E. Cartan.
The first eleven chapters form a logical unit, each chapter depending on the
results of the preceding chapters. (Of course, many chapters contain material
that can be omitted on first reading; this is generally found in starred sections.)

On the other hand, Chapters 12, 13, and the latter parts of Chapters 6 and 11
are independent of each other, and are to be regarded as illustrative applications
of the methods developed in the earlier chapters. Presented here are elementary
Sturm-Liouville theory and Fourier series, elementary differential geometry,
potential theory, and classical mechanics. We usually covered only one or two
of these topics in our one-year course.
We have not hesitated to present the same material more than once from
different points of view. For example, although we have selected the contraction
mapping fixed-point theorem as our basic approach to the in1plicit-function
theorem, we have also outlined a "Newton's method" proof in the text and have
sketched still a third proof in the exercises. Similarly, the calculus of variations
is encountered twice-once in the context of the differential calculus of an
infinite-dimensional vector space and later in the context of classical mechanics.
The notion of a submanifold of a vector space is introduced in the early ohapters,
while the invariant definition of a manifold is given later on.
In the introductory treatment of vector space theory, we are more careful
and precise than is customary. In fact, this level of precision of language is not
maintained in the later chapters. Our feeling is that in linear algebra, where the
concepts are so clear and the axioms so familiar, it is pedagogically sound to
illustrate various subtle points, such as distinguishing between spaces that are
normally identified, discussing the naturality of various maps, and so on. Later
on, when overly precise language would be more cumbersome, the reader should
be able to produce for hin1self a more precise version of any assertions that he
finds to be formulated too loosely. Similarly, the proofs in the first few chapters
are presented in more formal detail. Again, the philosophy is that once the
student has mastered the notion of what constitutes a fonnal mathematical
proof, it is safe and more convenient to present arguments in the usual mathematical colloquialisms.
While the level of formality decreases, the level of mathematical sophistication does not. Thus increasingly abstract and sophisticated mathematical
objects are introduced. It has been our experience that Chapter 9 contains the
concepts most difficult for students to absorb, especially the notions of the
tangent space to a manifold and the Lie derivative of various objects with
respect to a vector field.

There are exercises of many different kinds spread throughout the book.
Some are in the nature of routine applications. Others ask the r~ader to fill in
or extend various proofs of results presented in the text. Sometimes whole
topics, such as the Fourier transform or the residue calculus, are presented in
exercise form. Due to the rather abstract nature of the textual material, the student is strongly advised to work out as many of the exercises as he possibly can.
Any enterprise of this nature owes much to many people besides the authors,
but we particularly wish to acknowledge the help of L. Ahlfors, A. Gleason,
R. Kulkarni, R. Rasala, and G. Mackey and the general influence of the book by
Dieudonne. We also wish to thank the staff of Jones and Bartlett for their invaluable
help in preparing this revised edition.

INTRODUCTION

This preliminary chapter contains a short exposition of the set theory that
forms the substratum of mathematical thinking today. It begins with a brief
discussion of logic, so that set theory can be discussed with some precision, and
continues with a review of the way in which mathematical objects can be defined
as sets. The chapter ends with four sections which treat specific set-theoretic
topics.
It is intended that this material be used mainly for reference. Some of it
will be familiar to the reader and some of it will probably be new. We suggest
that he read the chapter through "lightly" at first, and then refer back to it
for details as needed.
1. LOGIC: QUANTIFIERS

A statement is a sentence which is true or false as it stands. Thus '1 < 2' and
'4 3 = 5' are, respectively, true and false mathematical statements. Many
sentences occurring in mathematics contain variables and are therefore not true
or false as they stand, but become statements when the variables are given
values. Simple examples are 'x < 4', 'x < 1/', 'x is an integer', '3x 2
y2 = 10'.
Such sentences will be called statementjrames. If P(x) is a frame containing the
one variable 'x', then P(5) is the statement obtained by replacing 'x' in P(x) by
the numeral '5'. For example, if P(x) is 'x < 4', then P(5) is '5 < 4', P(0)
is '0 < 4', and so on.
Another way to obtain a statement from the frame P(x) is to assert that P(x)
is always true. We do this by prefixing the phrase 'for every x'. Thus, 'for every
x, x < 4' is a false statement, and 'for every x, x 2 - 1 = (x - 1)(x
1)' is a
true statement. This prefixing phrase is called a universal quantifier. Synonymous phrases are 'for each x' and 'for all x', and the symbol customarily
used is '("Ix)', which can be read in any of these ways. One frequently presents
sentences containing variables as being always true without explicitly writing
the universal quantifiers. For instance, the associative law for the addition of
numbers is often written

+

+

+

x

+ (y + z) =

(x

+ y) + z,

where it is understood that the equation is true for all x, y and z.

Thus the

2

INTRODUCTION

actual statement being made is
(Vx) (Vy) (Vz) [x

+ (y + z)

=

(x

+ y) + z].

Finally, we can convert the frame P(x) into a statement by asserting that
it is sometimes true, which we do by writing 'there exists an x such that P(x)'.
This process is called existential quantification. Synonymous prefixing phrases
here are 'there is an x such that', 'for some x', and, symbolically, '(::jx)'.
The statement '(Vx)(x < 4)' still contains the variable 'x', of course, but
'x' is no longer free to be given values, and is now called a bound variable.
Roughly speaking, quantified variables are bound and unquantified variables
are free. The notation 'P(x), is used only when 'x' is free in the sentence being
discussed.
Now suppose that we have a sentence P(x, y) containing two free variables.
Clearly, we need two quantifiers to obtain a statement from this sentence.
This brings us to a very important observation. If quantifiers of both types are
used, then the order in which they are written affects the meaning of the statement;
(::jy)(Vx)P(x, y) and (Vx)(::jy)P(x, y) say different things. The first says that one y
can be found that works for all x: "there exists a y such that for all x ... ".
The second says that for each x a y can be found that works: "for each x there
exists a y such that ... ". ~ut in the second case, it may very well happen that
when x is changed, the y that can be found will also have to be changed. The
existence of a single y that serves for all x is thus the stronger statement. For
example, it is true that (Vx)(::jy)(x < y) and false that (::jy)(Vx)(x < y). The
reader must be absolutely clear on this point; his whole mathematical future is
at stake. The second statement says that there exists a y, call it Yo, such that
(Vx)(x < Yo), that is, such that every number is less than Yo. This is false;
Yo
1, in particular, is not less than Yo. The first statement says that for each x
we can find a corresponding y. And we can: take y = x
1.
On the other hand, among a group of quantifiers of the same type the order
does not affect the meaning. Thus '(Vx) (Vy)' and '(Vy) (Vx) , have the same meaning. We often abbreviate such clumps of similar quantifiers by using the quantification symbol only once, as in '(Vx, y)', which can be read 'for every x and y'.
Thus the strictly correct '(Vx) (Vy) (Vz) [x + (y + z) = (x + y) + zl' receives the
slightly more idiomatic rendition '(Vx, y, z)[x + (y + z) = (x + y) + zl'. The
situation is clearly the same for a group of existential quantifiers.
The beginning student generally feels that the prefixing phrases 'for every x
there exists a y such that' and 'there exists a y such that for every x' sound
artificial and are unidiomatic. This is indeed the case, but this awkwardness is the
price that has to be paid for the order of the quantifiers to be fixed, so that the
meaning of the quantified statement is clear and unambiguous. Quantifiers do
occur in ordinary idiomatic discourse, but their idiomatic occurrences often
house ambiguity. The following two sentences are good examples of such
ambiguous idiomatic usage: "Every x is less than some y" and "Some y is greater
than every x". If a poll were taken, it would be found that most men on the

+

street feel that these two sentences say the same thing, but half will feel that the
common assertion is false and half will think it true! The trouble here is that
the matrix is preceded by one quantifier and followed by another, and the poor
reader doesn't know which to take as the inside, or first applied, quantifier. The
two possible symbolic renditions of our first sentence, '[(Vx)(x < y)](3y)' and
'(Vx)[(x < y)(3y)1', are respectively false and true. Mathematicians do use
hanging quantifiers in the interests of more idiomatic writing, but only if they
are sure the reader will understand their order of application, either from the
context or by comparison with standard usage. In general, a hanging quantifier
would probably be read as the inside, or first applied, quantifier, and with this
understanding our two ambiguous sentences become true and false in that order.
After this apology the reader should be able to tolerate t.he definit.ion of
sequential convergence. It involves three quantifiers and runs as follows: The
sequence {xn} converges to x if (Ve) (3N) (Vn) (if n > N then IXn - xl < e).
In exactly the same format, we define a function f to be continuous at a if
(Ve) (3 0) (Vx) (if Ix - al < 0 then If(x) - f(a) I < e). We often omit an inside
universal quantifier by displaying the final frame, so that the universal quantification is understood. Thus we define f to be continuous at a if for every e
there is a 0 such that
if

Ix - al

< 0,

then

If(x) - f(a) I

<

E.

We shall study these definitions later. We remark only that it is perfectly
possible to build up an intuitive understanding of what these and similar
quantified statements actually say.
2. TIlE LOGICAL CONNECTIVES

When the word 'and' is inserted between two sentences, the resulting sentence
is true if both constituent sentences are true and is false otherwise. That is, the
"truth value", T or F, of the compound sentence depends only on the truth
values of the constituent sentences. We can thus describe the way 'and' acts in
compounding sentences in the simple "truth table"
P

Q

P and Q

T
T
F
F

T
F
T
F

T

F

where 'P' and 'Q' stand for arbitrary statement frames. Words like 'and' are
called logical connectives. It is often convenient to use symbols for connectives,
and a standard symbol for 'and' is the ampersand '&'. Thus 'P & Q' is read
'P andQ'.

4

0.2

INTRODUCTION

Another logical connective is the word 'or'. Unfortunately, this word is used
ambiguously in ordinary discourse. Sometimes it is used in the exclusive sense,
where 'P or Q' means that one of P and Q is true, but not both, and sometimes
it is used in the inclusive sense that at least one is true, and possibly both are
true. Mathematics cannot tolerate any fundamental ambiguity, and in mathematics 'or' is always used in the latter way. We thus have the truth table
P

Q

P orQ

T
T
F
F

T
F
T
F

T
T
T
Ii'

The above two connectives are binary, in the sense that they combine two
sentences to form one new sentence. The word 'not' applies to one sentence and
really shouldn't be considered a connective at all; nevertheless, it is called a
unary connective. A standard symbol for 'not' is '~'. Its truth table is obviously
P

~P

T

F

F

T

In idiomatic usage the word 'not' is generally buried in the interior of a
sentence. We write' x is not equal to y' rather than' not (x is equal to y)'.
However, for the purpose of logical manipulation, the negation sign (the word
'not' or a symbol like '~') precedes the sentence being negated. We shall, of
course, continue to write 'x ~ y', but keep in mind that this is idiomatic for
'not (x = y)' or '~(x = y)'.
We come now to the troublesome 'if ... ,then ... ' connective, which we
write as either 'if P, then Q' or 'P ==} Q'. This is almost always applied in the
universally quantified context (Vx) (P(x) ==} Q(x»), and its meaning is best
unraveled by a study of this usage. We consider 'if x < 3, then x < 5' to be a
true sentence. More exactly, it is true for all x, so that the universal quantification (Vx)(x < 3 ==} x < 5) is a true statement. This conclusion forces us to
agree that, in particular, '2 < 3 ==} 2 < 5', '4 < 3 ==} 4 < 5', and '6 < 3 ==}
6 < 5' are all true statements. The truth table for '==}' thus contains the
values entered below.

On the other hand, we consider 'x < 7 ==} x < 5' to be a false sentence, and
therefore have to agree that '6 < 7 ==} 6 < 5' is false. Thus the remaining row
in the table above gives the value 'F' for P ==} Q.
Combinations of frame variables and logical connectives such as we have
been considering are called truth-functional forms. We can further combine the
elementary forms such as 'P ==} Q' and '",P' by connectives to construct composite forms such as '",(P ==} Q)' and '(P ==} Q) & (Q ==} P)'. A sentence has a
given (truth-functional) form if it can be obtained from that form by substitution.
Thus 'x < y or ",(x < V)' has the form 'P or ",P', since it is obtained from this
form by substituting the sentence 'x < y' for the sentence variable 'P'. Composite truth-functional forms have truth tables that can be worked out by
combining the elementary tables. For example, '",(P ==} Q)' has the table below,
the truth value for the whole form being in the column under the connective
which is applied last ('",' in this example).

Q

",(P

T
F

Thus", (P ==} Q) is true only when P is true and Q is false.
A truth-functional form such as 'P or (",P), which is always true (i.e., has
only 'T' in the final column of its truth table) is called a tautology or a tautologous
form. The reader can check that
((P

and

==}

Q) & (Q

==}

R))

==}

(P

==}

R)

are also tautologous. Indeed, any valid principle of reasoning that does not
involve quantifiers must be expressed by a tautologous form.
The 'if and only if' form 'P <=? Q', or 'P if and only if Q', or 'P iff Q', is an
abbreviation for '(P ==} Q) & (Q ==} P)'. Its truth table works out to be
P

Q

P<=?Q

T
T
F

That is, P <=? Q is true if P and Q have the same truth values, and is false
otherwise.
Two truth-functional forms A and B are said to be equivalent if (the final
columns of) their truth tables are the same, and, in view of the table for '<=?',
we see that A and B are equivalent if A <=? B is tautologous, and conversely.

INTRODUCTION

Replacing a sentence obtained by substitution in a form A by the equivalent
sentence obtained by the same substitutions in an equivalent form B is a device
much used in logical reasoning. Thus to prove a statement P true, it suffices to
prove the statement ",P false, since 'P' and '",(",P), are equivalent forms.
Other important equivalences are
",(P or Q)

~

(",P) & (",Q),

(P => Q)
",(P => Q)

~

Q or (",P),
P & (",Q).

~

A bit of conventional sloppiness which we shall indulge in for smoother
idiom is the use of 'if' instead of the correct 'if and only if' in definitions. We
definefto be continuous at x if so-and-so, meaning, of course, thatfis continuous
at x if and only if so-and-so. This causes no difficulty, since it is clear that 'if
and only if' is meant when a definition is being given.
3. NEGATIONS OF QUANTIFIERS

The combinations '",(V'x)' and '(3x)",' have the same meanings: something is
not always true if and only if it is sometimes false. Similarly, '",(3y)' and '(V'y)",'
have the same meanings. These equivalences can be applied to move a negation
sign past each quantifier in a string of quantifiers, giving the following important
practical rule:
In taking the negation of a statement beginning with a string of quantifiers,
we simply change each quantifier to the opposite kind and move the negation
sign to the end of the string.

Thus

There are other principles of quantificational reasoning that can be isolated
and which we shall occasionally mention, but none seem worth formalizing here.
4. SETS

It is present-day practice to define every mathematical object as a set of some
kind or other, and we must examine this fundamental notion, however briefly.
A set is a collection of objects that is itself considered an entity. The objects
in the collection are called the elements or members of the set. The symbol for
'is a member of' is 'E' (a sort of capital epsilon), so that 'x E A' is read "x is a
member of A", "x is an element of A", "x belongs to A", or "x is in A".
We use the equals sign '=' in mathematics to mean logical identity; A = B
means that A is B. Now a set A is considered to be the same object as a set B
if and only if A and B have exactly the same members. That is, 'A = B' means
that (V'x)(x E A ~ x E B).

0.4

SETS

7

We say that a set A is a subset of a set B, or that A is included in B (or that
B is a superset of A) if every element of A is an element of B. The symbol for
inclusion is Ie'. Thus 'A e B' means that (Yx)(x E A = } x E B). Clearly,
(A = B)

{=}

(A

e B)

and (B

e

A).

This is a frequently used way of establishing set identity: we prove that A = B
by proving that A e B and that B e A. If the reader thinks about the above
equivalence, he will see that it depends first on the equivalence of the truth-functional forms 'P {=} Q' and '(P =} Q) & (Q =} P)', and then on the obvious
quantificational equivalence between '(Yx)(R & S)' and '(Yx)R & (Yx)S'.
We define a set by specifying its members. If the set is finite, the members
can actually be listed, and the notation used is braces surrounding a membership list. For example {I, 4, 7} is the set containing the three numbers 1, 4, 7,
{x} is the unit set of x (the set having only the one object x as a member),
and {x, y} is the pair set of x and y. We can abuse this notation to name some
infinite sets. Thus {2, 4, 6, 8, ... } would certainly be considered the set of all
even positive integers. But infinite sets are generally defined by statement
frames. If P(x) is a frame containing the free variable 'x', then {x : P(x)} is the
set of all x such that P(x) is true. In other words, {x : P(x)} is that set A such
that
yEA

{=}

P(y).

For example, {x: x 2 < 9} is the set of all real numbers x such that x 2 < 9,
that is, the open interval (-3, 3), and y E {x : x 2 < 9} {=} y2 < 9. A statement
frame P(x) can be thought of as stating a property that an object x mayor may
not have, and {x : P(x)} is the set of all objects having that property.
We need the empty set 0, in much the same way that we need zero in
arithmetic. If P(x) is never true, then {x: P(x)} = 0. For example,
{x:x ~ x}

= 0.

When we said earlier that all mathematical objects are customarily considered sets, it was taken for granted that the reader understands the distinction
between an object and a name of that object. To be on the safe side, we add a
few words. A chair is not the same thing as the word 'chair', and the number 4
is a mathematical object that is not the same thing as the numeral '4'. The
numeral '4' is a name of the number 4, as also are 'four', '2 2', and 'IV'.
According to our present viewpoint, 4 itself is taken to be some specific set.
There is no need in this course to carry logical analysis this far, but some readers
may be interested to know that we usually define 4 as {O, 1, 2, 3}. Similarly,
2 = {O, I}, 1 = {O}, and 0 is the empty set 0.
It should be clear from the above discussion and our exposition thus far
that we are using a symbol surrounded by single quotation marks as a name of
that symbol (the symbol itself being a name of something else). Thus' '4' , is a
name of '4' (which is itself a name of the number 4). This is strictly correct

+

INTRODUCTION

usage, but mathematicians almost universally mishandle it. It is accurate to
write: let x be the number; call this number 'x'. However, the latter is almost
always written: call this number x. This imprecision causes no difficulty to the
reading mathematician, and it often saves the printed page from a shower of
quotation marks. There is, however, a potential victim of such ambiguous
treatment of symbols. This is the person who has never realized that mathematics is not about symbols but about objects to which the symbols refer. Since
by now the present reader has safely avoided this pitfall, we can relax and
occasionally omit the strictly necessary quotation marks.
In order to avoid overworking the word 'set', we use many synonyms,
such as 'class', 'collection', 'family' and 'aggregate'. Thus we might say, "Let a
be a family of classes of sets". If a shoe store is a collection of pairs of shoes, then
a chain of shoe stores is such a three-level object.
5. RESTRICTED VARIABLES

A variable used in mathematics is not allowed to take all objects as values; it
can only take as values the members of a certain set, called the domain of the
variable. The dOInain is sometimes explicitly indicated, but is often only implied. For example, the letter' n' is customarily used to specify an integer, so
that' (Vn)P(n) , would automatically be read "for every integer n, P(n)". However, sometimes n is taken to be a positive integer. In case of possible ambiguity
or doubt, we would indicate the restriction explicitly and write' ("In E 71.)P(n)',
where' 71.' is the standard symbol for the set of all integers. The quantifier is
read, literally, "for all n in 71.", and more freely, "for every integer n". Similarly,
'(3n E 71.)P(n), is read "there exists an n in 71. such that P(n)" or "there exists
an integer n such that P(n)". Note that the symbol 'E' is here read as the
preposition' in'. The above quantifiers are called restricted quantifiers.
In the same way, we have restricted set formation, both implicit and explicit,
as in '{n: P(n)} , and '{n E 71. : pen)}', both of which are read "the set of all
integers n such that P(n)".
Restricted variables can be defined as abbreviations of unrestricted variables
by
("Ix E A)P(x)

¢=>

(3x E A)P(x)

¢=>

{x E A :P(x)}

=

("Ix) (x E A => P(x)),
(3x) (x E A & P(x)),
{x:x E A & P(x)}.

Although there is never any ambiguity in sentences containing explicitly
restricted variables, it sometimes helps the eye to see the structure of the
sentence if the restricting phrases are written in superscript position, as in
(Ve>o)(3n EZ ). Some restriction was implicit on page 1. If the reader agreed that
(Vx)(x 2 - 1 = (x - 1)(x
1)) was true, he probably took x to be a real
number.

ORDERED PAIRS AND RELATIONS

6. ORDERED PAIRS AND RELATIONS

Ordered pairs are basic tools, as the reader knows from analytic geometry.
According to our general principle, the ordered pair -< a, b> is taken to be a
certain set, but here again we don't care which particular set it is so long as it
guarantees the crucial characterizing property:
-<x,y> = -<a,b>

R

x = aandy = b.

Thus -<1, 3> ~ -<3,1>.
The notion of a correspondence, or relation, and the special case of a mapping, or function, is fundamental to mathematics. A correspondence is a pairing
of objects such that given any two objects x and y, the pair -< x, y> either does
or does not correspond. A particular correspondence (relation) is generally
presented by a statement frame P(x, y) having two free variables, with x and y
corresponding if any only if P(x, y) is true. Given any relation (correspondence),
the set of all ordered pairs -<x, y> of corresponding elements is called its graph.
Now a relation is a mathematical object, and, as we have said several times,
it is current practice to regard every mathematical object as a set of some sort
or other. Since the graph of a relation is a set (of ordered pairs), it is efficient and
customary to take the graph to be the relation. Thus a relation (correspondence)
is simply a set of ordered pairs. If R is a relation, then we say that x has the
relation R to y, and we write 'xRy', if and only if -<x, y> E R. We also say
that x corresponds to y under R. The set of all first elements occurring in the
ordered pairs of a relation R is called the domain of R and is designated dom R
or ~(R). Thus
dom R = {x: (~y)-<x, y> E R}.
The set of second elements is called the mnge of R:
rangeR =

{y:(~x)-<x,y>

ER}.

The inverse, R-l, of a relation R is the set of ordered pairs obtained by reversing
those of R:
R- 1 = {-<x, y> : -<y, x> E R}.
A statement frame P(x, y) having two free variables actually determines a pair
of mutually inverse relations R & S, called the gmphs of P, as follows:
R

=

{-<x, y> : P(x, y)},

S = {-<y, x> : P(x, y)}.

A two-variable frame together with a choice of which variable is considered to
be first might be called a directed frame. Then a directed frame would have a
uniquely determined relation for its graph. The relation of strict inequality
on the real number system IR would be considered the set {-<x, y> : x < y},
since the variables in 'x < y' have a natural order.
The set A X B = {-<x, y> : x E A & y E B} of all ordered pairs with
first element in A and second element in B is called the Cartesian product of the

10

0.7

INTRODUCTION

sets A and B. A relation R is always a subset of dom R X range R. If the two
"factor spaces" are the same, we can use exponential notation: A 2 = A X A.
The Cartesian product R2 = R X R is the "analytic plane". Analytic
geometry rests upon the one-to-one coordinate correspondence between R2 and
the Euclidean plane [2 (determined by an axis system in the latter), which
enables us to treat geometric questions algebraically and algebraic questions
geometrically. In particular, since a relation between sets of real numbers is a
subset of R2, we can "picture" it by the corresponding subset of the Euclidean
plane, or of any model of the Euclidean plane, such as this page. A simple
Cartesian product is shown in Fig. 0.1 (A U B is the union of the sets A and B).

If R is a relation and A is any set, then the restriction of R to A, R
is the subset of R consisting of those pairs with first element in A:

R

tA

=

r A,

{-<x, y> : -<x, y> E R and x E A}.

Thus R r A = R n (A X range R), where C n D is the intersection of the sets
CandD.
If R is a relation and A is any set, then the image oj A under R, R[A), is
the set of second elements of ordered pairs in R whose first elements are in A:
R[A} = {y: (3x)(x E A & -<x. y> E R)}.

Thus R[A] = range (R

r A), as shown in Fig. 0.2.

7. FUNCTIONS AND MAPPINGS

A Junction is a relation J such that each domain element x is paired with exactly
one range element y. This property can be expressed as follows:
-<x, y> EJ and -<x,

Z> EJ

=}

y = z.

0.7

FUNCTIONS AND MAPPINGS

11

The y which is thus uniquely determined by f and x is designated f(x):
y = f(x)

~

<x, y> Ef.

One tends to think of a function as being active and a relation which is not
a function as being passive. A function f acts on an element x in its domain to
givef(x). We take x and apply fto it; indeed we often call a function an operator.
On the other hand, if R is a relation but not a function, then there is in general
no particular y related to an element x in its domain, and the pairing of x and y
is viewed more passively.
We often define a function f by specifying its value f(x) for each x in its
domain, and in this connection a stopped arrow notation is used to indicate the
pairing. Thus x 1-+ x 2 is the function assigning to each number x its square x 2•

Fig. 0.3

If we want it to be understood that f is this function, we can write "Consider
the function f: x 1-+ X2ll • The domain of f must be understood for this notation
to be meaningful.
If f is a function, then 1 is of course a relation, but in general it is not a
function. For example, if f is the function x 1-+ X2, then 1 contains the pairs
<4,2> and <4, -2> and so is not a function (see Fig. 0.3). If 1 is a function, we say that f is one-to-one and that f is a one-to-one correspondence between
its domain and its range. Each x E domf corresponds to only one y E rangef
(f is a function), and each y E range f corresponds to only one x E dom f (r1 is
a function).
The notation·
f:A -tB

r

r

r

is read "a (the) function f on A into B" or "the function f from A to B". The
notation implies that f is a function, that domf = A, and that range feB.
Many people feel that the very notion of function should include all these
ingredients; that is, a function should be considered an ordered triple <f, A, B> ,
where f is a function according to our more limited definition, A is the domain

12

INTRODUCTION

0.8

of f, and B is a superset of the range of f, which we shall call the codomain of f in
this context. We shall use the terms 'map', 'mapping', and 'transformation'
for such a triple, so that the notationf: A --+ B in its totality presents a mapping.
Moreover, when there is no question about which set is the codomain, we shall
often call the function f itself a mapping, since the triple -<f, A, B>- is then
determined by f. The two arrow notations can be combined, as in: "Define
f: !Fl --+ !Fl by x 1-+ x 2 ".
A mapping f: A --+ B is said to be injective if f is one-to-one, surjective if
range f = B, and bijective if it is both injective and surjective. A bijective
mapping f: A --+ B is thus a one-to-one correspondence between its domain A
and its codomain B. Of course, a function is always surjective onto its range R,
and the statement that f is surjective means that R = B, where B is the understood codomain.
8. PRODUCT SETS; INDEX NOTATION

One of the characteristic habits of the modern mathematician is that as soon as
a new kind of object has been defined and discussed a little, he immediately
looks at the set of all such objects. With the notion of a function from A to S
well in hand, we naturally consider the set of all functions from A to S, which we
designate SA. Thus!Fl R is the set of all real-valued functions of one real variable,
and sz+ is the set of all infinite sequences in S. (It is understood that an infinite
sequence is nothing but a function whose domain is the set Z+ of all positive
integers.) Similarly, if we set n = {I, ... , n}, then Sri is the set of all finite
sequences of length n in S.
If B is a subset of S, then itR characteristic function (relative to S) is the function on S, usually designated XB, which has the constant value I on B and the
constant value 0 off B. The set of all characteristic functions of subsets of S is
thus 28 (since 2 = {O, I} ). But because this collection of functions is in a
natural one-to-one correspondence with the collection of all subsets of S, XB
corresponding to B, we tend to identify the two collections. Thus 28 is also
interpreted as the set of all subsets of S. We shall spend most of the remainder
of this section discussing further similar definitional ambiguities which mathematicians tolerate.
The ordered triple -< x, y, z>- is usually defined to be the ordered pair
-< -< x, y>- , z>- . The reason for this definition is probably that a function of
two variables x and y is ordinarily considered a function of the single ordered
pair variable -<x, y>-, so that, for example, a real-valued function of two real
variables is a subset of (!Fl X !Fl) X !Fl. But we also consider such a function a
subset of Cartesian 3-space !Fl 3 • Therefore, we define !Fl 3 as (!Fl X !Fl) X !Fl;
that is, we define the ordered triple -<x, y, z>- as -< -<x, y>-. z>-.
On the other hand, the ordered triple -<x, y, z>- could also be regarded as
the finite sequence { -< I, x>-, -< 2, y>-, -< 3, z>- }, which, of course, is a different
object. These two models for an ordered triple serve equally well, and, again,

0.8

PRODUCT SETS; INDEX NOTATION

13

mathematicians tend to slur over the distinction. We shall have more to say
on this point later when we discuss natural isomorphisms (Section 1.6). For
the moment we shall simply regard IRa and 1R"3" as being the same; an ordered
triple is something which can be "viewed" as being either an ordered pair of
which the first element is an ordered pair or as a sequence of length 3 (or, for that
matter, as an ordered pair of which the second element is an ordered pair).
Similarly, we pretend that Cartesian 4-space 1R4 is 1R4 , 1R2 X 1R2, or
IRI X IRa = IR X ((IR X IR) X IR), etc. Clearly, we are in effect assuming an
associative law for ordered pair formation that we don't really have.
This kind of ambiguity, where we tend to identify two objects that really are
distinct, is a necessary corollary of deciding exactly what things are. It is one
of the prices we pay for the precision of set theory; in days when mathematics
was vaguer, there would have been a single fuzzy notion.
The device of indices, which is used frequently in mathematics, also has ambiguous implications which we should examine. An indexed collection, as a set,
is nothing but the range set of a function, the indexing function, and a particular
indexed object, say Xi, is simply the value of that function at the domain element i.
If the set of indices is I, the indexed set is designated {Xi: i E l} or {Xi};EI
(or {Xi};:'l in case I = Z+). However, this notation suggests that we view the
indexed set as being obtained by letting the index run through the index set I
and collecting the indexed objects. That is, an indexed set is viewed as being
the set together with the indexing function. This ambivalence is reflected in the
fact that the same notation frequently designates the mapping. Thus we refer
to the sequence {Xn}:=l, where, of course, the sequence is the mapping n ~ Xn.
We believe that if the reader examines his idea of a sequence he will find this
ambiguity present. He means neither just the set nor just the mapping, but the
mapping with emphasis on its range, or the range "together with" the mapping.
But since set theory cannot reflect these nuances in any simple and graceful way,
we shall take an indexed set to be the indexing function. Of course, the same
range object may be repeated with different indices; there is no implication that
an indexing is one-to-one. Note also that indexing imposes no restriction on the
set being indexed; any set can at least be self-indexed (by the identity function).
Except for the ambiguous' {Xi: i E I}', there is no universally used notation
for the indexing function. Since Xi is the value of the function at i, we might
think of 'x;' as another way of writing 'xCi)', in which case we designate the
function 'x' or 'x'. We certainly do this in the case of ordered n-tuplets when
we say, "Consider the n-tuplet x = -< XI, • . • , x n »". On the other hand, there
is no compelling reason to use this notation. We can call the indexing function
anything we want; if it is j, then of course j( i) = Xi for all i.
We come now to the general definition of Cartesian product. Earlier we
argued (in a special case) that the Cartesian product A X B X C is the set of
all ordered triples x = -<XI, X2, xa» such that Xl E A, X2 E B, and Xa E C.
More generally, A I X A 2 X ... X An, or IIi=1 Ai, is the set of ordered ntuples x = -< XI, . . . , xn» such that Xi E Ai for i = 1, ... ,n. If we interpret

Theorem. A mapping f: A ---t B has an inverse if and only if it is bijective,
in which case its inverse is its relational inverse f-l.
Proof. If fis bijective, then the relational inverser 1 is a function from B to A,
and the equations fori = I Band r 1 0 f = I A are obvious. On the other
hand, if fog = I B, then f is surjective, since then every y in B can be written
y = f(g(y»). And if g 0 f = I A, then f is injective, for then the equation
f(x) = f(y) implies that x = y(j(x») = y(j(y») = y. Thus f is bijective if it

has an inverse. D
Now let ~(A) be the set of all bijections f: A ---t A. Then ~(A) is closed
under the binary operation of composition and
1) f 0 (y 0 h) = (f 0 y) 0 h for all f, g, h E~;
2) there exists a unique I E ~(A) such that f 0 I = I 0 f = f for all f E ~;
3) for each f E ~ there exists a unique y E ~ such that fog = g 0 f = I.
Any set G closed under a binary operation having these properties is called
a group with respect to that operation. Thus ~(A) is a group with respect to
composition.
Composition can also be defined for relations as follows. If RCA X Band
S C B X C, then S 0 RCA X C is defined by
-<x,z>- ESoR <=> ( 3y EB)(-<x,y>- ER& -<y,z>- ES).

If Rand S are mappings, this definition agrees with our earlier one.
10. DUALITY

There is another elementary but important phenomenon called duality which
occurs in practically all branches of mathematics. Let F: A X B ---t C be any
function of two variables. It is obvious that if x is held fixed, then F(x, y) is a
function of the one variable y. That is, for each fixed x there is a function
h X: B ---t C defined by hX(y) = F(x, y). Then x 1-+ hX is a mapping cp of A into
CB. Similarly, each y E B yields a function gy E C A , where gy(x) = F(x, y),
and y 1-+ yy is a mapping (J from B to CA.
Now suppose conversely that we are given a mapping cp: A ---t CB. For each
x E A we designate the corresponding value of cp in index notation as h so
that hX is a function from B to C, and we define F: A X B ---t C by F(x, y) =
hX(y). We are now back where we started. Thus the mappings cp: A ---t C B,
/1': A X B ---t C, and (J: B ---t CA are equivalent, and can be thought of as three
different ways of viewing the same phenomenon. The extreme mappings cp and
(J will be said to be dual to each other.
X,

INTRODUCTION

The mapping I() is the indexed family of functions {hx: x E A} C CB. Now
suppose that 5' C CB is an unindexed collection of functions on B into C, and
define F: 5' X B -+ C by F(f, y) = f(y). Then 8: B -+ (J'.f is defined by gll(f) =
f(y). What is happening here is simply that in the expressionf(y) we regard both
symbols as variables, so that f(y) is a function on 5' X B. Then when we hold y
fixed, we have a function on 5' mapping 5' into C.
W c shall see some important applications of this duality principle as our
subject develops. For example, an m X n matrix is a function t = {tij} in
RmXn. We picture the matrix as a rectangular array of numbers, where Ii' is
the row index and Ij' is the column index, so that tij is the number at the intersection of the ith row and the jth column. If we hold i fixed, we get the n-tuple
forming the ith row, and the matrix can therefore be interpreted as an m-tuple
of row n-tuples. Similarly (dually), it can be viewed as an n-tuple of column
m-tuples.
In the same vein, an n-tuple -<!I, ... ,fn > of functions from A to B can
be regarded as a single n-tuple-valued function from A to Bn,

In a somewhat different application, duality will allow us to regard a finitedimensional vector space V as being its own second conjugate space (V*)*.
It is instructive to look at elementary Euclidean geometry from this point
of view. Today we regard a straight line as being a set of geometric points.
An older and more neutral view is to take points and lines as being two different
kinds of primitive objects. Accordingly, let A be the set of all points (so that A
is the Euclidean plane as we now view it), and let B be the set of all straight lines.
Let F be the incidence function: F(p, l) = 1 if p and I are incident (p is "on" l,
I is "on" p) and F(p, l) = 0 otherwise. Thus F maps A X B into {O, 1}. Then
for each IE B the function gl(P) = F(p, I) is the characteristic function of the
set of points that we think of as being the line l (gl(P) has the value 1 if p is on l
and 0 if p is not on l.) Thus each line determines the set of points that are on it.
But, dually, each point p determines the set of lines I "on" it, through its characteristic function hP(I). Thus, in complete duality we can regard a line as being
a set of points and a point as being a set of lines. This duality aspect of geometry
is basic in projective geometry.
It is sometimes awkward to invent new notation for the "partial" function
obtained by holding a variable fixed in a function of several variables, as we did
above when we set gil (x) = F(x, y), and there is another device that is frequently
useful in this situation. This is to put a dot in the position of the "varying
variable". Thus F(a,') is the function of one variable obtained from F(x, y)
by holding x fixed at the value a, so that in our beginning discussion of duality
we have
hX = F(x, .),
gil = F(·, y).
If f is a function of one variable, we can then write f

=

f('), and so express the

0.11

THE BOOLEAN OPERATIONS

above equations also as h"'(-) = F(x, .), gy(-) = F( . , y). The flaw in this notation
is that we can't indicate substitution without losing meaning. Thus the value
of the function F(x,·) at b is F(x, b), but from this evaluation we cannot read
backward and tell what function was evaluated. Weare therefore forced to
some such cumbersome notation as F(x, ·)/b, which can get out of hand. Nevertheless, the dot device is often helpful when it can be used without evaluation
difficulties. In addition to eliminating the need for temporary notation, as
mentioned above, it can also be used, in situations where it is strictly speaking
superfluous, to direct the eye at once to the position of the variable.
For example, later on D~F will designate the directional derivative of the
function F in the (fixed) direction~. This is a function whose value at a is
D~F(a), and the notation D~F(-) makes this implicitly understood fact explicit.
11. THE BOOLEAN OPERATIONS

Let S be a fixed domain, and let 5' be a family of subsets of S. The union of 5',
or the union of all the sets in 5', is the set of all elements belonging to at least one
set in 5'. We designate the union U5' or UAE~ A, and thus we have
U5' = {x: (3A E~)(X E A)},

Y E U5'

¢=}

(3A E~)(y E A).

We often consider the family 5' to be indexed. That is, we assume given a set I
(the set of indices) and a surjective mapping i 1-+ Ai from I to 5', so that 5' =
{Ai: i E I}. Then the union of the indexed collection is designated UiEI Ai or
U {Ai: i E I}. The device of indices has both technical and psychological
advantages, and we shall generally use it.
If 5' is finite, and either it or the index set is listed, then a different notation
is used for its union. If 5' = {A, B}, we designate the union A U B, a notation
that displays the listed names. Note that here we have x E A u B ¢=} x E A or
x E B. If 5' = {Ai: i = 1, ... ,n}, we generally write 'AI U A2 U· .. U An'
or 'Uf=l Ai' for U5'·
The intersection of the indexed family {Ai}iEI, designated niEI Ai, is the
set of all points that lie in every Ai. Thus
x E nAi

¢=}

iEI

fYiEI)(x E Ai).

For an unindexed family 5' we use the notation n5' or nAE~ A, and if 5' =
{A, B}, then n5' = An B.
The complement, A', of a subset of S is the set of elements x ,~: S not in
A: A' = {XES: x fJ. A}. The law of De Morgan states that the complement of
an intersection is the union of the complements:

A n (B U C) = (A n B) U (A n C),
A u (B n C) = (A u B) n (A U C).

Even here, thinking in terms of indices makes the laws more intuitive. Thus

'sometimes not in'.
The family 5' is disjoint if distinct sets in 5' have no elements in common, i.e.,
if ('IX, yE5')(X ~ Y =} X n Y = 0). For an indexed family {Ai}iEI the
condition becomes i ~ J =} Ai n Aj = 0. If 5' = {A, B}, we simply say that
A and B are disjoint.

PARTITIONS AND EQUIVALENCE RELATIONS

The first, but not the other two, of the three identities above remains valid
when f is replaced by any relation R. It follows from the commutative law,
(3x)(3y)A ~ (3y)(3x)A. The second identity fails for a general R because
'(3x)(Vy)' and '(Vy)(3x)' have different meanings.
12. PARTITIONS AND EQUIVALENCE RELATIONS

A partition of a set A is a disjoint family ;r of sets whose union is A. We call the
elements of;r 'fibers', and we say that;r fibers A or is afibering of A. For example,
the set of straight lines parallel to a given line in the Euclidean plane is a fibering
of the plane. If 'x' designates the unique fiber containing the point x, then
x ~ x is a surjective mapping 71': A ~ ;r which we call the projection of A on;r.
Passing from a set A to a fibering ;r of A is one of the principal ways of forming
new mathematical objects.
Any function f automatically fibers its domain into sets on which f is constant. If A is the Euclidean plane and f(p) is the x-coordinate of the point p in
some coordinate system, then f is constant on each vertical line; more exactly,
j-l(X) is a vertical line for every x in IR. Moreover, x ~ j-l(X) is a bijection
from IR to the set of all fibers (vertical lines). In general, if j: A ~ B is any surjective mapping, and if for each value y in B we set
Ay

=

j-l(y)

=

{x E A: j(x)

=

y},

then ;r = {Ay: y E B} is a fibering of A and cp: y ~ Ay is a bijection from
B to;r. Also cp 0 f is the projection 71': A ~;r, since cp 0 j(x) = cp(j(x) is the
set x of all z in A such that j(z) = j(x).
The above process of generating a fibering of A from a function on A is
relatively trivial. A more important way of obtaining a fibering of A is from
an equality-like relation on A called an equivalence relation. An equivalence
relation ~ on A is a binary relation which is reflexive (x ~ x for every x E A),
symmetric (x ~ y =? Y ~ x), and transitive (x ~ y and y ~ z =? X ~ z). Every
fibering;r of A generates a relation ~ by the stipulation that x ~ y if and only if
x and yare in the same fiber, and obviously ~ is an equivalence relation. The
most important fact to be established in this section is the converse.
Theorem. Every equivalence relation
of a fibering.

~

on A is the equivalence relation

Proof. We obviously have to define x as the set of elements y equivalent to x,
x = {y: y ~ x}, and our problem is to show that the family ;r of all subsets of A

obtained this way is a fibering.
The reflexive, symmetric, and transitive laws become
x Ex,

x E 'ii

=?

Y Ex,

and

x E 'ii and y E Z

=? X

E Z.

Reflexivity thus implies that ;r covers A. Transitivity says that if y E z, then
x E 'ii =? X E z; that is, if y E z, then 'ii c z. But also, if y E z, then z E 'ii by

20

symmetry, and so z C y. Thus y E z implies y = z. Therefore, if two of our
sets a and b have a point x in common, then a = x = 0. In other words, if a is
not the set b, then a and b are disjoint, and we have a fibering. 0
The fundamental role this argument plays in mathematics is due to the fact
that in many important situations equivalence relations occur as the primary
object, and then are used to define partitions and functions. We give two
examples.
Let lL be the integers (positive, negative, and zero). A fraction 'min' can
be considered an ordered pair -< m, n>- of integers with n -:;e o. The set of all
fractions is thus lL X (lL - {OJ). Two fractions -<m, n>- and -<p, q>- are
"equal" if and only if mq = np, and equality is checked to be an equivalence
relation. The equivalence class -< m, n>- is the object taken to be the rational
number min. Thus the rational number system Q is the set of fibers in a partition of lL X (lL - {O}).
Next, we choose a fixed integer p ElL and define a relation E on lL by
mEn <=> p divides m - n. Then E is an equivalence relation, and the set lLp of
its equivalence classes is called the integers modulo p. It is easy to see that mEn
if and only if m and n have the same remainder when divided by p, so that in
this case there is an easily calculated function f, where f(m) is the remainder
after dividing m by p, which defines the fibering. The set of possible remainders
is {O, 1, ... , p - I}, so that lLp contains p elements.
A function on a set A can be "factored" through a fibering of A by the
following theorem.
Theorem. Let g be a function on A, and let g: be a fibering of A. Then g
is constant on each fiber of g: if and only if there exists a function y on g:
such that g = y 0 7r.

Proof. If g is constant on each fiber of g:, then the association of this unique
value with the fiber defines the function y, and clearly g = yo 7r. The converse
is obvious. 0

CHAPTER 1

VECTOR SPACES

The calculus of functions of more than one variable unites the calculus of one
variable, which the reader presumably knows, with the theory of vector spaces,
and the adequacy of its treatment depends directly on the extent to which vector
space theory really is used. The theories of differential equations and differential
geometry are similarly based on a mixture of calculus and vector space theory.
Such "vector calculus" and its applications constitute the subject matter of this
book, and in order for our treatment to be completely satisfactory, we shall
have to spend considerable time at the beginning studying vector spaces themselves. This we do principally in the first two chapters. The present chapter is
devoted to general vector spaces and the next chapter to finite-dimensional
spaces.
We begin this chapter by introducing the basic concepts of the subjectvector spaces, vector subspaces, linear combinations, and linear transformations-and then relate these notions to the lines and planes of geometry. Next
we establish the most elementary formal properties of linear transformations and
Cartesian product vector spaces, and take a brief look at quotient vector spaces.
This brings us to our first major objective, the study of direct sum decompositions, which we undertake in the fifth section. The chapter concludes with a
preliminary examination of bilinearity.
I. FUNDAMENTAL NOTIONS
Vector spaces and subspaces. The reader probably has already had some
eontact with the notion of a vector space. l\Iost beginning calculus texts discuss
1!:cometric vectors, which are represented by "arrows" drawn from a chosen
origin O. These vectors are added geometrically by the parallelogram rule:
The sum of the vector 01 (represented by the arrow from 0 to A) and the
vcctor Oii is the vector QP, where P is the vertex opposite 0 in the parallelogram
having OA and OB as two sides (Fig. 1.1). Vectors can also be multiplied by
numbers: x(o"A) is that vector DB such that B is on the line through 0 and
:1, the distance from 0 to B is Ixl times the distance from 0 to A, and B and A
arc on the same side of 0 if x is positive, and on opposite sides if x is negative

Fig. 1.3

(Fig. 1.2). These two vector operations satisfy certain laws of algebra,
which we shall soon state in the definition. The geometric proofs of these laws
are generally sketchy, consisting more of plausibility arguments than of airtight
logic. For example, the geometric figure in Fig. 1.3 is the essence of the usual
proof that vector addition is associative. In each case the final vector OX is
represented by the diagonal starting from 0 in the parallelepiped constructed
from the three edges OA, OB, and ~C. The set of all geometric vectors, together
with these two operations and the laws of algebra that they satisfy, constitutes
one example of a vector space. We shall return to this situation in Section 2.
The reader may also have seen coordinate triples tr€ated as vectors. In this
system a three-dimensional vector is an ordered triple of numbers -< Xl, X2, xa>
which we think of geometrically as the coordinates of a point in space. Addition
is now algebraically defined,
-<Xb X2,Xa>

+ -<YbY2,Ya>

= -<Xl+Yb X.2+Y2,Xa+Ya>,

as is multiplication by numbers, t-<Xl' X2, xa> = -<tXl, tX2, tXa>.
The
vector laws are much easier to prove for these objects, since they are almost
algebraic formalities. The set ~3 of all ordered triples of numbers, together with
these two operations, is a second example of a vector space.

1.1

FUNDAMENTAL NOTIONS

23

If we think of an ordered triple -<Xli X2, X3 >- as a function x with domain
the set of integers from 1 to 3, where Xi is the value of the function x at i (see
Section 0.8), then this vector space suggests a general type called a function
space, which we shall examine after the definition. For the moment we remark
only that we defined the sum of the triple x and the triple y as that triple z
such that Zi = Xi
Yi for every i.
A vector space, then, is a collection of objects that can be added to each
other and multiplied by numbers, subject to certain laws of algebra. In this
context a number is often called a scalar.

Definition. Let V be a set, and let there be given a mapping -< a, fl >- .a
fl from V X V to V, called addition, and a mapping -<x, a>- .- xa
from IR X V to V, called multiplication by scalars. Then V is a vector space

for all a E V.

In contexts where it is clear (as it generally is) which operations are intended,
we refer simply to the vector space V.
Certain further properties of a vector space follow directly from the axioms.
Thus the zero element postulated in A3 is unique, and for each a the fl of A4
is unique, and is called -a. Also Oa = 0, xO = 0, and (-I)a = -a. These
elementary consequences are considered in the exercises.
Our standard example of a vector space will be the set V = IRA of all realvalued functions on a set A under the natural operations of addition of two
functions and multiplication of a function by a number. This generalizes the
example lR(l,2,31 = 1R3 that we looked at above. Remember that a function f
in IRA is simply a mathematical object of a certain kind. We are saying that two
of these objects can be added together in a natural way to form a third such
object, and that the set of all such objects then satisfies the above laws for
addition. Of course, f
g is defined as the function whose value at a is f(a)
y(a), so that (f + g)(a) = f(a) + g(a) for all a in A. For example, in 1R3 we
defined the sum x y as that triple whose value at i is Xi Yi for all i. Similarly,
cf is the function defined by (cf)(a) = c(j(a») for all a. Laws Al through 84
follow at once from these definitions and the corresponding laws of algebra for
the real number system. For example, the equation (s
t)f = sf tf means

+ (tf)(a)

= (sf + tf)(a),

where we have used the definition of scalar multiplication in IRA, the distributive
law in IR, the definition of scalar multiplication in IRA, and the definition of
addition in IRA, in that order. Thus we have S2, and the other laws follow
similarly.
The set A can be anything at all. If A = IR, then V = IRR is the vector
space of all real-valued functions of one real variable. If A = IR X IR, then
V = IRRXR is the space of all real-valued functions of two real variables. If
A = {1,2} = 2, then V = 1R2 = 1R2 is the Cartesian plane, and if A =
{I, ... ,n} = ii, then V = IRn is Cartesian n-space. If A contains a single
point, then IRA is a natural bijective image of IR itself, and of course IR is trivially
a vector space with respect to its own operations.
Now let V be any vector space, and suppose that W is a nonempty subset of
V that is closed under the operations of V. That is, if a and {3 are in W, then so
is a
(3, and if a is in W, then so is Xa for every scalar x. For example, let V be
the vector space lR[a,bl of all real-valued functions on the closed interval [a, b) C IR,
and let W be the set e([a, b]) of all continuous real-valued functions on [a, b).
Then W is a subset of V that is closed under the operations of V, since f + g
and cf are continuous whenever f and g are. Or let V be Cartesian 2-space 1R2,
and let W be the set of ordered pairs x = -<XI, X2> such that Xl + X2 = O.
Clearly, W is closed under the operations of V.
Such a subset W is always a vector space in its own right. The universally
quantified laws AI, A2, and Sl through S4 hold in W because they hold in the
larger set V. And since there is some {3 in W, it follows that 0 = O{3 is in W
because W is closed under multiplication by scalars. For the same reason, if a
is in W, then so is -a = (-l)a. Therefore, A3 and A4 also hold, and we see
that W is a vector space. We have proved the following lemma.

+

W is a nonempty subset of a vector space V which is closed
under the operations of V, then W is itself a vector space.

Lelllilla. If

We call Wa subspace of V. Thus e([a, b]) is a subspace of lR[a,bl, and the
pairs -<Xl, X2> such that Xl + X2 = 0 form a subspace of 1R2. Subspaces will
be with us from now to the end.
A subspace of a vector space IRA is called a function space. In other words, a
function space is a collection of real-valued functions on a common domain
which is closed under addition and multiplication by scalars.
What we have defined so far ought to be called the notion of a real vector
space or a vector space over IR. There is an analogous notion of a complex vector
space, for which the scalars are the complex numbers. Then laws Sl through S4
refer to mUltiplication by complex numbers, and the space C A of all complex-

valued functions on A is the standard example. In fact, if the reader knew what
is meant by a field F, we could give a single general definition of a vector space
over F, where scalar multiplication is by the elements of F, and the standard
example is the space V = FA of all functions from A to F. Throughout this
book it will be understood that a vector space is a real vector space unless explicitly stated otherwise. However, much of the analysis holds as well for complex
vector spaces, and most of the pure algebra is valid for any scalar field F.

Linear combinations and linear span. Because of the commutative and associative laws for vector addition, the sum of a finite set of vectors is the same for all
possible ways of adding them. For example, the sum of the three vectors
aa, ab, a c can be calculated in 12 ways, all of which give the same result:

Therefore, if I = {a, b, c} is the set of indices used, the notation LiEI ai,
which indicates the sum without telling us how we got it, is unambiguous. In
general, for any finite indexed set of vectors {ai: i E l} there is a uniquely
determined sum vector LiEI ai which we can compute by ordering and grouping the a/s in any way.
The index set I is often a block of integers n = {1, ... ,n}. In this case
the vectors ai form an n-tuple {ai}~' and unless directed to do otherwise we
would add them in their natural order and write the sum as Li'=l ai. Note
that the way they are grouped is still left arbitrary.
Frequently, however, we have to use indexed sets that are not ordered.
For example, the general polynomial of degree at most 5 in the two variables
's' and 't' is

and the finite set of monomials {Siti}i+i:$5 has no natural order.

polynomial function f(t) = L~ ci. If A is finite, it is often useful to take the
indexed set {ai} to be the whole of A, and to simply use a O-coefficient for any
vector missing from the sum. Thus, if A is the subset {sin t, cos t, et } of IR R ,
then we can consider A an ordered triple in the listed ordering, and the function
cos t
(-I)e t is the linear combination of the
3 sin t - et = 3· sin t
triple A having the coefficient triple -< 3, 0, -1>-.
Consider now the set L of all linear combinations of the two vectors
-< 1, 1, 1>- and -< 0, 1, -1>- in 1R3. It is the set of all vectors s -< 1, 1, 1>t -< 0, 1, -1>- = -< s, s t, s - t>-, where sand t are any real numbers. Thus
L = {-<s, s t, s - t>- : -<s, t>- E 1R2}. It will be clear on inspection that
L is closed under addition and scalar multiplication, and therefore is a subspace
of 1R3. Also, L contains each of the two given vectors, with coefficient pairs
-< 1, 0>- and -< 0, 1>-, respectively. Finally, any subspace M of 1R3 which
contains ·each of the two given vectors will also contain all of their linear combinations, and so will include L. That is, L is the smallest subspace of 1R3 containing
-< 1, 1, 1>- and -< 0, 1, -1>-. It is called the linear span of the two vectors, or the
subspace generated by the two vectors. In general, we have the following theorem.

Theorem 1.1. If A is a nonempty subset of a vector space V, then the set
L(A) of all linear combinations of the vectors in A is a subspace, and it is
the smallest subspace of V which includes the set A.

Proof. Suppose first that A is finite. We can assume that we have indexed A
in some way, so that A = {ai: i E I} for some finite index set I, and every
element of L(A) is of the form LiEI Xiai. Then we have
(L Xiai)

+

(L Yiai)

=

L (Xi

+ Yi)ai

+

because the left-hand side becomes Li (Xiai Yiai) when it is regrouped by
pairs, and then S2 gives the right-hand side. We also have
e(L Xiai) = L(exi)ai

by S3 and mathematical induction. Thus L(A) is closed under addition and
multiplication by scalars and hence is a subspace. Moreover, L(A) contains
each ai (why?) and so includes A. Finally, if a subspace W includes A, then it
contains each linear combination L Xiai, so it includes L(A). Therefore, L(A)
can be directly characterized as the uniquely determined smallest subspace
which includes the set A.
If A is infinite, we obviously can't use a single finite listing. However, the
sum (L~ Xiai) + (Lf Yj{3j) of two linear combinations of elements of A is
clearly a finite sum of scalars times elements of A. If we wish, we can rewrite it
as L~+m Xiai, where we have set (3j = an+j and Yj = xn+j for j = 1, ... , m.
In any case, L(A) is again closed under addition and multiplication by scalars
and so is a subspace. 0
We call L(A) the linear span of A. If L(A) = V, we say that A spans V;
V is finite-dimensional if it has a finite spanning set.
If V = JR3, and if 0\ 02 , and 03 are the "unit points on the axes", 01 =
-<1,0,0>-,0 2 = -<0,1,0>-, and 03 = -<0,0,1>-, then {Oi}r spans V, since
x= -<Xl, X2, X3>- = -<XllO,O>-<0,X2,0>-<0,0,X3>- = X101
X202
X303 = L~ XiO i for every x in JR3. More generally, if V = JRn and oj is
the n-tuple having 1 in the jth place and elsewhere, then we have similarly that
x = -< Xl, ... , Xn >- = Li'=l Xioi, so that {oi}l spans JR n. Thus JRn is finitedimensional. In general, a function space on an infinite set A will not be finitedimensional. For example, it is true but not obvious that e([a, bJ) has no finite
spanning set.

is sometimes taken as the definition of linear span.
1.37 By convention, the sum of an empty set of vectors is taken to be the zero vector.
This is necessary if Theorem 1.1 is to be strictly correct. Why? What about the
preceding problem?
Linear transformations. The general function space JRA and the subspace
e([a, bJ) of jR[a,bJ both have the property that in addition to being closed under

the vector operations, they are also closed under the operation of multiplication
of two functions. That is, the pointwise product of two functions is again a
function [(fg)(a) = f(a)g(a)J, and the product of two continuous functions is
continuous. With respect to these three operations, addition, multiplication,

30

and scalar multiplication, IRA and e([a, b]) are examples of algebras. If the reader
noticed this extra operation, he may have wondered why, at least in the context
of function spaces, we bother with the notion of vector space. Why not study
all three operations? The answer is that the vector operations are exactly the
operations that are "preserved" by many of the most important mappings of
sets of functions. For example, define T: e([a, b]) ~ IR by T(f) = f: f(t) dt.
Then the laws of the integral calculus say that T(f + g) = T(f) + T(g) and
T(cf) = cT(f). Thus T "preserves" the vector operations. Or we can say that T
"commutes" with the vector operations, since plus followed by T equals T
followed by plus. However, T does not preserve multiplication: it is not true in
general that T(fg) = T(f)T(g).
Another example is the mapping T: x ~ y from 1R3 to 1R2 defined by
YI = 2XI - X2 + X3, Y2 = Xl + 3X2 - 5X3, for which we can again verify
that T(x + y) = T(x) + T(y) and T(cx) = cT(x). The theory of the solvability
of systems of linear equations is essentially the theory of such mappings T; thus
we have another important type of mapping that preserves the vector operations
(but not products).
These remarks suggest that we study vector spaces in part so that we can
study mappings which preserve the vector operations. Such mappings are
called linear transformations.
Definition. If V and Ware vector spaces, then a mapping T: V ~ W is a
linear transformation or a linear map if T(a

In order to acquire a supply of examples, we shall find all linear transformations having IR n as domain space. It may be well to start by looking at one such
transformation. Suppose we choose some fixed triple of functions {Ii} ~ in the
space IRR of all real-valued functions on IR, say !I (t) = sin t, f 2(t) = cos t, and
fa(t) = et = exp(t). Then for each triple of numbers x = {xiH in 1R3 we have
the linear combination L~=l Xdi with {Xi} as coefficients. This is the element of
IRR whose value at t is L~ xiIi(t) = Xl sin t
X2 cos t X3et. Different coefficient
triples give different functions, and the mapping x 1-+ L~=l xdi = Xl sin
X2 cos X3 exp is thus a mapping from 1R3 to IRR. It is clearly linear. If we call
this mapping T, then we can recover the determining triple of functions from T
as the images of the "unit points" ~i in 1R3; T(~j) = L ~!Ii = Ii, and so
T(~l) = sin, T(~2) = cos, and T(~3) = expo We are going to see that every
linear mapping from 1R3 to IRR is of this form.
In the following theorem {~iH is the spanning set for IR n that we defined
earlier, so that x = Li Xi~i for every n-tuple x = <Xl, ••• , x n > in IRn.

Theorelll 1.2. If {~j} i is any fixed n-tuple of vectors in a vector space W,

then the "linear combination mapping" x 1-+ Li Xi~i is a linear transformation T from IR n to W, and T(~j) = ~j for j = 1, ... ,n. Conversely,
if T is any linear mapping from IR n to W, and if we set ~j = T(~j) for j =
1, ... ,n, then T is the linear combination mapping x 1-+ Li Xi~i.
Proof. The linearity of the linear combination map T follows by exactly the
same argument that we used in Theorem 1.1 to show that L(A) is a subspace.

Conversely, if T: IR n ~ W is linear, and if we set (3j = T(5 j ) for all j, then for
any x = -< Xb .•• , xn>- in IR n we have T(x) = T(L:i Xi 5i ) = L:i xiT( 5i ) =
L:i Xi{3i. Thus T is the mapping x ~ L:i xi{3i. 0
This is a tremendously important theorem, simple though it may seem, and
the reader is urged to fix it in his mind. To this end we shall invent some terminology that we shall stay with for the first three chapters. If a = {ab ... , an}
is an n-tuple of vectors in a vector space W, let La. be the corresponding linear
combination mapping x ~ L:i Xiai from IR n to W. Note that the n-tuple a
itself is an element of W n • If T is any linear mapping from IR n to W, we shall call
the n-tuple {T(5 i)} i the skeleton of T. In these terms the theorem can be restated
as follows.
Theorelll 1.2'. For each n-tuple a in W n , the map La.: IR n ~ W is linear
and its skeleton is a. Conversely, if T is any linear map from IR n to W, then

T = Lp where (3 is the skeleton of T.

Or again:
Theorelll 1.2". The map a ~ La. is a bijection from wn to the set of all
linear maps T from IR n to W, and T ~ skeleton (T) is its inverse.

A linear transformation from a vector space V to the scalar field IR is called
a linear functional on V. Thus f ~ f: f(t) dt is a linear f,unctional on V =
e([a, bJ). The above theorem is particularly simple for a linear functional F:
since W = IR, each vector (3i = F(5 i ) in the skeleton of F is simply a number bi ,
and the skeleton {b i } i is thus an element of IRn. In this case we would write
F(x) = L:i biXi, putting the numerical coefficient 'b/ before the variable
'xi'. Thus F(x) = 3x! - X2
4X3 is the linear functional on 1R3 with skeleton
-< 3, -1, 4>-. The set of all linear functionals on IR n is in a natural one-to-one
correspondence with IR n itself; we get b from F by bi = F(5 i ) for all i, and we
get F from b by F(x) = L: biXi for all x in IRn.
We next consider the case where the codomain space of T is a Cartesian
space IR m, and in order to keep the two spaces clear in our minds, we shall, for
the moment, take the domain space to be 1R3. Each vector (3i = T(5 i ) in the
skeleton of T is now an m-tuple of numbers. If we picture this m-tuple as a
column of numbers, then the three m-tuples {3i can be pictured as a rectangular
army of numbers, consisting of three columns each of m numbers. Let tij be the
ith number in the jth column. Then the doubly indexed set of numbers {tij} is
called the matrix of the transformation T. We call it an m-by-3 (an m X 3)
matrix because the pictured rectangular array has m rows and three columns.
The matrix determines T uniquely, since its columns form the skeleton of T.
The identity T(x) = L:~ x jT(5 j ) = L:~ Xj{3j allows the m-tuple T(x) to be
calculated explicitly from x and the matrix {tij}. Picture multiplying the
column m-tuple {3j by the scalar Xj and then adding across the three columns at

the ith row, as below:

Since tij is the ith number in the m-tuple (3j, the ith number in the m-tuple

and this set of m scalar equations is equivalent to the one-vector equation
y = T(x).
We can now replace three by n in the above discussion without changing
anything except the diagram, and thus obtain the following specialization of
Theorem 1.2.
Theorelll 1.3. Every linear mapping T from IR n to IR m determines the
m X n matrix t = {tij} having the skeleton of T as its columns, and the
expression of the equation y = T(x) in linear combination form is equivalent

to the m scalar equations

Conversely, each m X n matrix t determines the linear combination mapping
having the columns of t as its skeleton, and the mapping t 1---+ T is therefore
a bijection from the set of all m X n matrices to the set of all linear maps
from IR n to IRm.
A linear functional F on IR n is a linear mapping from IR n to IR 1, so it must
be expressed by a 1 X n matrix. That is, the n-tuple b in IR n which is the skeleton
of F is viewed as a matrix of one row and n columns.
As a final example of linear maps, we look at an important class of special
linear functionals defined on any function space, the so-called coordinate functionals. If V = IRI and i E I, then the ith coordinate functional 1ri is simply
evaluation at i, so that 1ri(f) = f(i). These functionals are obviously linear. In
fact, the vector operations on functions were defined to make them linear; since
sf tg is defined to be that function whose value at i is sf(i)
tg(i) for all i,
we see that sf tg is by definition that function such that 1ri(sf tg) =
S1ri(f)
t1ri(g) for all i!
If V is IR n , then 1rj is the mapping x = -<Xl> ... , x n >- 1---+ Xj. In this case
we know from the theorem that 1rj must be of the form 1rj(x) = L1 biXi for
some n-tuple b. What is b?

The general form of the linearity property, TeE Xiai) = L xiT(ai), shows
that T and T- l both carry subspaces into subspaces.
Theorem 1.4. If T: V ~ W is linear, then the T-image of the linear span
of any subset A C V is the linear span of the T-image of A: T[L(A)] =
L(T[AJ). In particular, if A is a subspace, then so is T[A]. Furthermore, if Y
is a subspace of W, then T-l[y] is a subspace of V.
Proof. According to the formula T(L Xiai) = L xiT(ai), a vector in W is
the T-image of a linear combination on A if and only if it is a linear combination
on T[A]. That is, T[L(A)] = L(T[AJ). If A is a subspace, then A = L(A) and
T[A] = L(T[AJ), a subspace of W. Finally, if Y is a subspace of Wand {ail C
T-lfY], then T(L Xiai) = L xiT(ai) E L(Y) = Y. Thus L Xiai E T-l[y]
and T-l[y] is its own linear span. 0

The subspace T-l(O) = {a E V: T(a) = O} is called the null space, or
kernel, of T, and is designated N(T) or meT). The range of T is the subspace
T[V] of W. It is designated R(T) or (!l(T).
Lemma 1.1. A linear mapping T is injective if and only if its null space
is {O}.
Proof. If T is injective, and if a rf 0, then T(a) rf T(O) = 0 and the null space
accordingly contains only O. On the other hand, if N(T) = {O}, then whenever
a rf {3, we have a - (3 rf 0, T(a) - T({3) = T(a - (3) rf 0, and T(a) rf T({3);
this shows that T is injective. 0

A linear map T: V ~ W which is bijective is called an isomorphism.
Two vector spaces V and Ware isomorphic if and only if there exists an isomorphism between them.
For example, the map -< Cl, ... , Cn >- ~ Lo- l Ci+1Xi is an isomorphism of
n
IR with the vector space of all polynomials of degree < n.
Isomorphic spaces "have the same form", and are identical as abstract
vector spaces. That is, they cannot be distinguished from each other solely on
the basis of vector properties which they do or do not have.
When a linear transformation is from V to itselfJ special things can happen.
One possibility is that T can map a vector a essentially to itself, T(a) = Xa
for some x in IR. In this case a is called an eigenvector (proper vector, characteristic vector), and x is the corresponding eigenvalue.

2. VECTOR SPACES AND GEOMETRY

The familiar coordinate systems of analytic geometry allow us to consider
geometric entities such as lines and planes in vector settings, and these geometric
notions give us valuable intuitions about vector spaces. Before looking at the
vector forms of these geometric ideas, we shall briefly review the construction of
the coordinate correspondence for three-dimensional Euclidean space. As usual,
the confident reader can skip it.
We start with the line. A coordinate correspondence between a line Land
the real number system IR is determined by choosing arbitrarily on L a zero
point 0 and a unit point Q distinct from O. Then to each point X on L is assigned
the number x such that JxJ is the distance from 0 to X, measured in terms of
the segment OQ as unit, and x is positive or negative according as X and Q are
on the same side of 0 or on opposite sides. The mapping X ~ x is the coordinate
correspondence. Now consider three-dimensional Euclidean space 1E3. We want
to set up a coordinate correspondence between 1E3 and the Cartesian vector
space 1R3. We first choose arbitrarily a zero point 0 and three unit points
Ql, Q2, and Q3 in such a way that the four points do not lie in a plane. Each of

the unit points Qi determines a line Li through 0 and a coordinate correspondence on this line, as defined above. The three lines L l , L 2, and L3 are called
the coordinate axes. Consider now any point X in 1E3. The plane through X
parallel to L2 and L3 intersects Ll at a point X b and therefore determines a
number Xl, the coordinate of Xl on L l . In a similar way, X determines points
X 2 on L2 and X 3 on L3 which have coordinates X2 and X3, respectively. Altogether X determines a triple

in ~3, and we have thus defined a mapping
(): X ~ x from 1E3 to ~3 (see Fig. 1.4).
We call () the coordinate correspondence
defined by the axis system. The convention implicit in our notation above is that
()(Y) is y, ()(A) is a, etc. Note that the
unit point Ql on Ll has the coordinate
triple 01 = -< 1,0,0>, and similarly, that

There are certain basic facts about the coordinate correspondence that have
to be proved as theorems of geometry before the correspondence can be used to
treat geometric questions algebraically. These geometric theorems are quite
tricky, and are almost impossible to discuss adequately on the basis of the usual
secondary sch:)ol treatment of geometry. We shall therefore simply assume
them. They are:
1) () is a bijection from 1E3 to ~3.
2) Two line segments AB and XY are equal in length and parallel, and the
direction from A to B is the same as that from X to Y if and only if b - a =
y - X (in the vector space ~3). This relationship between line segments is
important enough to formalize. A directed line segment is a geometric line segment, together with a choice of one of the two directions along it. If we interpret
AB as the directed line segment from A to B, and if we define the directed line
segments AB and XY to be equivalent (and write AB ~ XV) if they are equal
in length, parallel, and similarly directed, then (2) can be restated:

AB

XY

3) If X ~ 0, then Y is on the line through 0 and X in 1E3 if and only if

= tx for some t in R Moreover, this t is the coordinate of Y with respect to X

as unit point on the line through 0 and X.

4) If the axis system in 1E3 is Cartesian, that is, if the axes are mutually
perpendicular and a common unit of distance is used, then the length 10XI of
the segment OX is given by the so-called Euclidean norm on 1R 3 , 10XI =
CE~ Xi 2 )1/2. This follows directly from the Pythagorean theorem. Then this
formula and a second application of the Pythagorean theorem to the triangle
OXY imply that the segments OX and OY are perpendicular if and only if the
scalar product (x, y) = L~=l XiYi has the value 0 (see Fig. 1.5).
In applying this result, it is useful to note that the scalar product (x, y) is
linear as a function of either vector variable when the other is held fixed. Thus

Exactly the same theorems hold for the coordinate correspondence between
the Euclidean plane 1E2 and the Cartesian 2-space 1R2, except that now, of course,
(x, y) = L~ XiYi = XIYl
X2Y2·
We can easily obtain the equations for lines and
planes in 1E3 from these basic theorems. First, we see
from (2) and (3) that if fixed points A and B are given,
X
with A F- 0, then the line through B parallel to the
segment OA contains the point X if and only if there
0
exists a scalar t such that x - b = ta (see Fig. 1.6).
Therefore, the equation of this line is

+

x

= ta+ h.

Fig. 1.6

This vector equation is equivalent to the three numerical equations Xi =
ait bi , i = 1, 2, 3. These are customarily called the parametric equations of the
line, since they present the coordinate triple x of the varying point X on the line
as functions of the "parameter" t.

+

1.2

Next, we know that the plane through B perpendicular to the direction of
the segment OA contains the point X if and only if BX 1. OA, and it therefore
follows from (2) and (4) that the plane contains X if and only if (x - b, a) = 0
(see Fig. 1.7). But (x - b, a) = (x, a) - (b, a) by the linearity of the scalar
product in its first variable, and if we set l = (b, a), we see that the equation of
the plane is
(x, a) = l

or

That is, a point X is on the plane through B perpendicular to the direction of
OA if and only if this equation holds for its coordinate triple x. Conversely,
if a ¢ 0, then we can retrace the steps taken above to show that the set of points
X in 1E3 whose coordinate triples x satisfy (x, a) = l is a plane.

A

Fig. 1.7

The fact that 1R3 has the natural scalar product (x, y) is of course extremely
important, both algebraically and geometrically. However, most vector spaces
do not have natural scalar products, and we shall deliberately neglect scalar
products in our early vector theory (but shall return to them in Chapter 5).
This leads us to seek a different interpretation of the equation L~ aiXi = l.
We saw in Section 1 that x 1---+ L~ aiXi is the most general linear functional f on
1R3. Therefore, given any plane 111 in 1E 3, there is a nonzero linear functional f
on 1R3 and a number l such that the equation of 111 is f(x) = l. And conversely,
given any nonzero linear functional f: IRa ~ IR and any l E IR, the locus of
I(x) = l is a plane M in 1E3. The reader will remember that we obtain the
coefficient triple a from f by ai = f(~i), since then f(x) = f(LI Xi~i) =

Ll3 x;J( ~i )

=

Lla Xiai·

Finally, we seek the vector form of the notion of parallel translation. In
plane geometry when we are considering two congruent figures that are parallel
and similarly oriented, we often think of obtaining one from the other by "sliding

40

VECTOR SPACES

1.2

the plane along itself" in such a way that all lines remain parallel to their original
positions. This description of a parallel translation of the plane can be more
elegantly stated as the condition that every directed line segment slides to an
equivalent one. If X slides to Y and 0 slides to B, then OX slides to BY, so
that OX ~ BY and x = y - b by (2). Therefore, the coordinate form of such
a parallel sliding is the mapping x ~ y = x + b.
Conversely, for any b in ~2 the plane mapping defined by x ~ y = x + b
is easily seen to be a parallel translation. These considerations hold equally well
for parallel translations of the Euclidean space 1E 3 •
It is geometrically clear that under a parallel translation planes map to
parallel planes and lines map to parallel lines, and now we can expect an easy
algebraic proof. Consider, for example, the plane 111 with equation f(x) = l;
let us ask what happens to 111 under the translation x ~ y = x + b. Since
x = y - b, we see that a point x is on 111 if and only if its translate y satisfies
the equation f(y - b) = lor, since f is linear, the equation f(y) = l', where
l' = l + f(b). But this is the equation of a plane N. Thus the translate of M
is the plane N.
It is natural to transfer all this geometric terminology from sets in 1E3
to the corresponding sets in ~3 and therefore to speak of the set of ordered
triples x satisfying f(x) = l as a set of points in ~3 forming a plane in ~3, and
to call the mapping x ~ x + b the (parallel) translation of ~3 through b, etc.
l\Ioreover, since ~3 is a vector space, we would expect these geometric ideas to
interplay with vector notions. For instance, translation through b is simply the
operation of adding the constant vector b: x ~ x + b. Thus if 111 is a plane, then
the plane N obtained by translating 111 through b is just the vector set sum
111 + b. If the equation of 111 is f(x) = l, then the plane 111 goes through 0 if
and only if l = 0, in which case 111 is a vector subspace of ~3 (the null space of f).
It is easy to see that any plane 111 is a translate of a plane through O. Similarly,
the line {ta + b : t E ~} is the translate through b of the line {ta : t E ~}, and
this second line is a subspace, the linear span of the one vector a. Thus planes
and lines in ~3 are translates of subspaces.

These notions all carryover to an arbitrary real vector space in a perfectly
satisfactory way and with additional dimensional variety. A plane in ~3
through 0 is a vector space which is two-dimensional in a strictly algebraic sense
which we shall discuss in the next chapter, and a line is similarly one-dimensional.
In ~3 there are no proper subspaces other than planes and lines through 0,
but in a vector space V with dimension n > 3 proper subspaces occur with all
dimensions from 1 to n - 1. We shall therefore use the term "plane" loosely to
refer to any translate of a subspace, whatever its dimension. More properly,
translates of vector subspaces are called affine subspaces.
We shall see that if V is a finite-dimensional space with dimension n, then
the null space of a nonzero linear functionalfis always (n - I)-dimensional, and
therefore it cannot be a Euclidean-like two-dimensional plane except when

1.2

41

n = 3. We use the term hyperplane for such a null space or one of its translates.
Thus, in general, a hyperplane is a set with the equation f(x) = l, where f is
a nonzero linear functional. It is a proper affine subspace (plane) which is maximal in the sense that the only affine subspace properly including it is the whole
of V. In ~3 hyperplanes are ordinary geometric planes, and in ~2 hyperplanes
are lines!

3. PRODUCT SPACES AND HOM(V, W)

Product spaces. If W is a vector space and A is an arbitrary set, then the set

V = W A of all W-valued functions on A is a vector space in "exactly the same
way that ~A is. Addition is the natural addition of functions, (f + g) (a) =
f(a) + g(a), and, similarly, (xf)(a) = x(j(a) for every function f and scalar x.
Laws Al through S4 follow just as before and for exactly the same reasons. For
variety, let us check the associative law for addition. The equation! + (g + h) =
(f + g) + h means that (j + (g + h)(a) = ((f + g) + h) (a) for all a E A.
But
(j + (g

(a) = f(a)

((f

(j(a) + g(a) + h(a)

where the middle equality in this chain of five holds by the associative law for W
and the other four are applications of the definition of addition. Thus the
associative law for addition holds in W A because it holds in W, and the other
laws follow in exactly the same way. As before, we let 7ri be evaluation at i,
so that 7ri(f) = f(i). Now, however, 7ri is vector valued rather than scalar valued,
because it is a mapping from V to W, and we call it the ith coordinate projection
rather than the ith coordinate functional. Again these maps are all linear.
In fact, as before, the natural vector operations on W A are uniquely defined by
the requirement that the projections 7ri all be linear. We call the value fU) =
7r j(f) the jth coordinate of the vector f. Here the analogue of Cartesian n-space
is the set wn of all n-tuples a = -< al, ... , a n >- of vectors in W; it is also
designated W n • Clearly, aj is the jth coordinate of the n-tuple a.
There is no reason why we must use the same space W at each index, as we
did above. In fact, if W b . . . , W n are any n vector spaces, then the set of all
n-tuples a = -<ab ... , a n >- such that aj E Wj for j = 1, ... , n is a vector
space under the same definitions of the operations and for the same reasons.
That is, the Cartesian product W = W 1 X W 2 X ... X W n is also a vector
space of vector-valued functions. Such finite products will be very important
to us. Of course, ~n is the product IIi Wi with each Wi = ~; but ~n can also
be considered ~m X ~n-m, or more generally, IIf Wi, where Wi = ~mi and
L:f mi = n. However, the most important use of finite product spaces arises
from the fact that the study of certain phenomena on a vector space V may
lead in a natural way to a collection {ViH of subspaces of V such that V is
isomorphic to the product IIi Vi. Then the extra structure that V acquires
when we regard it as the product space IIi Vi is used to study the phenomena
in question. This is the theory of direct sums, and we shall investigate it in
Section 5.
Later in the course we shall need to consider a general Cartesian product of
vector spaces. We remind the reader that if {Wi: i E J} is any indexed collection
of vector spaces, then the Cartesian product IIiEI Wi of these vector spaces is

44

1.3

VECTOR SPACES

defined as the set of all functions f with domain I such that f(i) E Wi for all
i E I (see Section 0.8).
The following is a simple concrete example to keep in mind. Let S be the
ordinary unit sphere in 1R 3 , S = {x: L~ x~ = I}, and for each point x on S
let W" be the subspace of 1R3 tangent to S at x. By this we mean the subspace
(plane through 0) parallel to the tangent plane to S at x, so that the translate
W" + x is the tangent plane (see Fig. 1.8). A function f in the product space
W = II"es W" is a function which assigns to each point x on S a vector in W",
that is, a vector parallel to the tangent plane to Sat x. Such a function is called
a vector field on S. Thus the product set W is the set of all vector fields on S,
and W itself is a vector space, as the next theorem states.

Fig. 1.8

Of course, the jth coordinate projection on W = IIiES Wi is evaluation
at j, 7rj(f) = f(j), and the natural vector operations on Ware uniquely defined
by the requirement that the coordinate projections all be linear. Thus f + g
must be that element of W whose value at j, 7rj(f + g), is 7rj(f) + 7rj(g) =
f(j) + g(j) for all j E I, and similarly for mUltiplication by scalars.
Theorem. 3.1. The Cartesian product of a collection of vector spaces can
be made into a vector space in exactly one way so that the coordinate projections are all linear.
Proof. With the vector operations determined uniquely as above, the proofs of
Al through S4 that we sampled earlier hold verbatim. They did not require that
the functions being added have all their values in the same space, but only that
the values at a given domain element i all lie in the same space. 0
Hom.(V, W). Linear transformations have the simple but important properties

that the sum of two linear transformations is linear and the composition of two
linear transformations is linear. These imprecise statements are in essence the
theme of this section, although they need bolstering by conditions on domains
and codomains. Their proofs are simple formal algebraic arguments, but the
objects being discussed will increase in conceptual complexity.

W)

If W is a vector space and A is any set, we know that the space W A of all
mappings f: A -+ W is a vector space of functions (now vector valued) in the
same way that IRA is. If A is itself a vector space V, we naturally single out for
special study the subset of WV consisting of all linear mappings. We designate
this subset Hom(V, W). The fonowing elementary theorems summarize its
basic algebraic properties.
TheoreIn 3.2. Hom(V, W) is a vector subspace of WV.

Pl·oof. The theorem is an easy formality. If Sand T are in Hom(V, W), then

(S

+ T)(xa. + y(3) =

S(xa. + y,8) + T(xa. + y,8)
+ yS(,8) + xT(a.) + yT(,8) =

xeS + T)(a.)

+ yeS + T)(,8),

so S + T is linear and Hom(V, W) is closed under addition. The reader should
be sure he knows the justification for each step in the above continued equality.
The closure of Hom(V, W) under multiplication by scalars fonows similarly,
and since Hom(V, W) contains the zero transformation, and so is nonempty,
it is a subspace. 0
TheoreIn 3.3. The composition of linear maps is linear: if T E Hom(V, W)
and S E Hom(W, X), then SoT E Hom(V, X). Moreover, composition
is distributive over addition, under the obvious hypotheses on domains and
codomains:

Corollary. If T E Hom(V, W) is fixed, then composition on the right by T
is a linear transformation from the vector space Hom(W, X) to the vector
space Hom(V, X). It is an isomorphism if T is an isomorphism.

P1'Oof. The algebraic properties of composition stated in the theorem can be
combined as follows:

The first equation says exactly that composition on the right by a fixed T is a
linear transformation. (Write SoT as 3(S) if the equations still don't look
right.) If T is an isomorphism, then composition by T- l "undoes" composition
by T, and so is its inverse. 0

46

1.3

VECTOR SPACES

The second equation implies a similar corollary about composition on the
left by a fixed S.
TheoreIn 3.4. If W is a product vector space, W = IIi Wi, then a mapping
T from a vector space V to W is linear if and only if 7ri 0 T is linear for
each coordinate projection 7ri.
Proof. If T is linear, then 7ri

0

T is linear by the above theorem. Now suppose,
0 T are linear.
Then

conversely, that all the maps 7ri

Therefore,

T)({3)

+ yT({3»).
T(xa + y(3) = xT(a) +
= 7ri(xT(a)

If T is a linear mapping from ~n to W whose skeleton is {{3j} n, then 7ri 0 T
has skeleton {7ri({3j)}f=l. If W is ~m, then 7ri is the ith coordinate functional
y 1---+ Yi, and (3j is the jth column in the matrix t = {tij} of T. Thus 7ri({3j) = tij,
and 7ri 0 T is the linear functional whose skeleton is the ith row of the matrix of T.
In the discussion centering around Theorem 1.3, we replaced the vector
equation y = T(x) by the equivalent set of m scalar equations Yi = L:f=l tijXj,
which we obtained by reading off the ith coordinate in the vector equation. But
in "reading off" the ith coordinate we were applying the coordinate mapping
7ri, or in more algebraic terms, we were replacing the linear map T by the set of
linear maps {7ri 0 T}, which is equivalent to it by the above theorem.
Now consider in particular the space Hom(V, V), which we may as well
designate 'Hom(V)'. In addition to being a vector space, it is also closed under
composition, which we consider a multiplication operation. Since composition
of functions is always associative (see Section 0.9), we thus have for multiplication the laws
A 0 (B 0 C) = (A 0 B) 0 C,
A 0 (B
C) = (A 0 B)
(A 0 C),
(A
B) 0 C = (A 0 C)
(B 0 C),
k(A 0 B) = (kA) 0 B = A 0 (kB).

Any vector space which has in addition to the vector operations an operation
of multiplication related to the vector operations in the above ways is called
an algebra. Thus,
TheoreIn 3.5. Hom(V) is an algebra.
We noticed earlier that certain real-valued function spaces are also algebras.
Examples were ~A and e([O, 1]). In these cases multiplication is commutative,
but in the case of Hom(V) multiplication is not commutative unless V is a
trivial space (V = {O}) or V is isomorphic to~. We shall check this later when
we examine the finite-dimensional theory in greater detail.

PRODUCT SPACES AND HOM(V, W)

Product projections and injections. In addition to the coordinate projections,

there is a second class of simple linear mappings that is of basic importance in
the handling of a Cartesian product space W = IIkEK Wk. These are, for each
j, the mapping OJ taking a vector a E W j to the function in the product space
having the value a at the index j and elsewhere. For example, O2 for WI X
W 2 X W3 is the mapping a ~ -<0, a, 0> from W 2 to W. Or if we view ~3 as
~ X ~2, then O2 is the mapping -< X2, X3 > ~ -< 0, -< X2, X3> > = -< 0, X2, X3 > .
We call OJ the injection of Wj into IIk Wk. The linearity of OJ is probably obvious.
The mappings 7r j and OJ are clearly connected, and the following pl'Ojectioninjection identities state their exact relationship. If I j is the identity transformation on Wj, then

If K is finite and I is the identity on the product space W, then

= I.

In the case IIt=l Wi, we have 02 0 11'2(-<aI, a2, a3» = -<0, a2, 0>, and
the identity simply says that -< aI, 0, >
-< 0, a2, >
-< 0, 0, a3> =
-< aI, a2, a3> for all aI, a2, a3' These identities will probably be clear to the
reader, and we leave the formal proofs as an exercise.
The coordinate projections 11'j are useful in the study of any product space,
but because of the limitation in the above identity, the injections OJ are of
interest principally in the case of finite products. Together they enable us to
decompose and reassemble linear maps whose domains or codomains are finite
product spaces.
For a simple example, consider the T in Hom(~3, ~2) whose matrix is

Then 11'1 0 T is the linear functional whose skeleton -< 2, -1, 1> is the first row
in the matrix of T, and we know that we can visualize its expression in equation
X3, as being obtained from the vector equation y =
form, Yl = 2Xl - X2
T(x) by "reading off the first row". Thus we "decompose" T into the two linear
functionals li = 11'i 0 T. Then, speaking loosely, we have the reassembly
T = -< h, l2> j more exactly, T(x) = -< 2Xl - X2
X3, Xl
X2
4X3> =
-< II (x), l2(X) > for all x. However, we want to present this reassembly as the
action of the linear maps 01 and O2 . We have

+

+

which shows that the decomposition and reassembly of T is an expression of the
identity L Oi 0 11'i = I. In general, if T E Hom(V, W) and W = IIi Wi, then
Ti = 11'; 0 T is in Hom(V, Wi) for each i, and Ti can be considered "the part
of T going into W/', since Ti(a) is the ith coordinate of T(a) for each a. Then we

48

1.3

can reassemble the T/s to form T again by T = L Oi 0 T i, for L Oi 0 Ti =
(L Oi 0 'Tri) 0 T = loT = T. Moreover, any finite collection of T/s on a
common domain can be put together in this way to make a T. For example,
we can assemble an m-tuple {Ti} of linear maps on a common domain V to
form a single m-tuple-valued linear map T. Given a in V, we simply define
T(a) as that m-tuple whose ith coordinate is Ti(a) for i = 1, ... , m, and then
check that T is linear. Thus without having to calculate, we see from this
assembly principle that T: x ~ -< 2XI - X2

mapping from 1R3 to 1R2, since we have formed T by assembling the two linear
X3 and l2(X) = Xl
X2
4X3 to form a
functionals ll(X) = 2XI - X2
single ordcrcd-pair-valued map. This very intuitive proccss has an cqually
simple formal justification. We rigorize our discussion in the following theorem.

Theorem 3.6. If Ti is in Hom(V, Wi) for each i in a finite index set I,
and if W is the product space IIiEI Wi, then there is a uniquely determined
Tin Hom(V, W) such that Ti = 'Tri 0 T for all i in I.
Proof. If T exists such that Ti =

T for each i, then T

(L Oi 'Tri) T = L Oi (7ri T) = L Oi T i. Thus T is uniquely determincd

In the same way, we can decompose a linear T whose domain is a product
space V = II;'=1 V j into the maps T j = To OJ with domains Vj, and thcn
reassemble these maps to form T by the identity T = L;'=l T j 0 'Trj (check it
mentally!). lVloreover, a finite collection of maps into a common codomain
space can be put together to form a single map on the product of the domain
spaces. Thus an n-tuple of maps {Ti} ~ into W defines a single map T into W,
where the domain of T is the product of the domains of the T/s, by the equation
T( -< aI, ... , an >-) = L~ Ti(ai) or T = L~ Ti 0 'Tri. For example, if T I: IR ~ 1R2
is the map t ~ t -< 2, 1 >- = -< 2t, t>-, and T 2 and T 3 are similarly the maps
t ~ t -< -1, 1>- and t ~ t -< 1,4>-, then T = Lt Ti 0 7ri is the mapping from
1R3 to 1R2 whose matrix is

Again there is a simple formal argument, and we shall ask the reader to write
out the proof of the following theorem.
Theorem 3.7. If T j is in Hom(Vj, W) for each J in a finite index set J,
and if V = IIjEJ Vi> then there exists a unique T in Hom(V, W) such
that To OJ = T j for eachJ in J.
Finally we should mention that Theorem 3.6 holds for all product spaces,
finite or not, and states a property that characterizes product spaces. We shall

1.3

investigate this situation in the exercises. The proof of the general case of
Theorem 3.6 has to get along without the injections OJ; instead, it is an application
of Theorem 3.4.
The reader may feel that we are being overly formal in using the projections
7ri and the injections Oi to give algebraic formulations of processes that are
easily visualized directly, such as reading off the scalar "components" of a
vector equation. However, the mappings
and

4. AFFINE SUBSPACES AND QUOTIENT SPACES

In this section we shall look at the "planes" in a vcctor space V and see what
happens to them when we translate them, intersect them with each other,
take their images under linear maps, and so on. Then we shall confine ourselves
to the set of all planes that are translates of a fixed subspace and discover that
this set itself is a vector space in the most obvious way. Some of this material
has been anticipated in Section 2.
Affine subspaces. If N is a subspace of a vector space V and a is any vector
of V, then the set N
a = {~+ a : ~ EN} is called either the coset of N
containing a or the affine subspace of V through a and parallel to N. The set N a

+

+

is also called the translate of N through a. We saw in Section 2 that affine subspaces are thc general objects that we want to call planes. If N is given and fixed
in a discussion, we shall use the notation a = N
a (see Section 0.12).
We begin with a list of some simple properties of affine subspaces. Some of
these will gencralize observations already made in Section 2, and the proofs of
some will be left as exercises.
1) With a fixed subspace N assumed, if 'Y E a, then 'Y = a. For if 'Y =
a + 7]0, then 'Y + 7] = a + (7]0 + 7]) E a, so 'Y Ca. Also a + 7] = 'Y + (7] - 7]0) E 'Y,
soaC'Y. Thusa= 'Y.
2) With N fixed, for any a and {3, either a = 11 or a and 11 are disjoint.
For if a and 11 are not disjoint, then there exists a 'Y in each, and a = 'Y = 11
by (1). The reader may find it illuminating to compare these calculations with
the more general ones of Section 0.12. Here a ~ {3 if and only if a - (3 EN.
3) Now let a be the collection of all affine subspaces of V; a is thus the set
of all cosets of all vector subspaces of V. Then the intersection of any sub-

+

1.4

AFFINE SUBSP,\CES AXD QUOTIEXT SP,\CES

53

family of Ci is either empty or itself an affine subspace. In fact, if [Ai} iEI is
an indexed collection of affine subspaces and Ai is a coset of the vector subspace
Wi for each i E I, then niEI Ai is either empty or a coset of the vector subspace
niEI Wi. For if {3 E niEI Ai, then (1) implies that Ai = {3
Wi for all i, and
then nAi = (3
nWi.
4) If A, BE Ci, then A + BE Ci. That is, the set sum of any two affine
subspaces is itself an affine ~mbspace.
5) If A E Ci and T E Hom(V, W), then T[A] is an affine subspace of W.
In particular, if t E IR, then tA E Ci.
6) If B is an affine subspace of Wand T E Hom(V, TV), then T- 1 [B] is
either empty or an affine subspace of V.
7) For a fixed a E V the translation of V through a is the mapping
Sa: V ~ V defined by Sa(~) = ~
a for all ~ E V. Translation is not linear;
for example, Sa(O) = a. It is clear, however, that translation carries affine
subspaces into affine subspaces. Thus Sa(A) = A + a and Sa({3 + W) =
(a
(3)
W.
8) An affine transformation from a vector space V to a vector space W is a
linear mapping from V to W followed by a translation in W. Thus an affine
transformation is of the form ~ f-+ T(~)
(3, where T E Hom(V, W) and (3 E W.
Note that ~ f-+ T(~ a) is affine, since

+

+

+

+ +

+
T(~ + a) =

+

T(~)

+ {3,

where

(3 = T(a).

It follows from (5) and (7) that an affine transformation carries affine
subspaces of V into affine subspaces of W.
Now fix a subspace N of V, and consider the set W of all
translates (cosets) of N. We are going to see that W itself is a vector space in
the most natural way possible. Addition will be set addition, and scalar multiplication will be set multiplication (except in one special case). For example, if N
is a line through the origin in 1R 3, then W consists of all lines in 1R3 parallel to N.
Weare saying that this set of parallel lines will automatically turn out to be a
vector space: the set sums of any two of the lines in W turn out to be a line in W!
And if LEW and t ~ 0, then the set product tL is a line in W. The translates
of L fiber 1R 3 , and the set of fibers is a natural vector space.
During this discussion it will be helpful temporarily to indicate set sums by
'+s' and set products by I •• '. With N fixed, it follows from (2) above that two
eosets are disjoint or identical, so that the set W of all cosets is a fibering of V
in the general case, just as it was in our example of the parallel lines. From (4)
or by a direct calculation we know that ex +. II = a + (3. Thus W is closed
under set addition, and, naturally, we take this to be our operation of addition
on W. That is, we define + on W by ex + II = ex +. II. Then the natural map
7r: a f-+ ex from V to W preserves addition, 7r(a (3) = 7r(a)
7r({3), since
Quotient space.

54

1.4

VECTOH SPACES

+

+

this is just our equation a
{3 = a
~ above. Similarly, if t EO IR, then the
set product t . s a is either ta or {O]. Hence if we define ta as the set product when
t ,e 0 and as 0 = N when t = 0, then 7r also preserves scalar multiplication,
7r(ta)

= t7r(a).

We thus have two vectorlike operations on the set W of all cosets of N,
and we naturally expect W to turn out to be a vector space. We could prove this
by verifying all the laws, but it is more elegant to notice the general setting for
such a verification proof.
Theorem 4.1. Let V be a vector space, and let W be a set having two

vectorlike operations, which we designate in the usual way. Suppose that
there exists a surjective mapping T: V --+ W which preserves the operations:
T(sa
t(3) = sT(a)
tT({3). Then W is a vector space.

+

+

Proof. We have to check laws Al through S4. However, one example should
make it clear to the reader how to proceed. We show that T(O) satisfies A3 and
hence is the zero vector of lV. Since every (3 EO W is of the form T(a), we have
T(O)

+ (3 =

T(O)

+ T(a)

= T(O + a) = T(a) =

(3,

which is A3. We shall ask the reader to check more of the laws in the exercises. 0
Theorem 4.2. The set of cosets of a fixed subspace N of a vector space V

themselves form a vector space, called the quotient space V IN, under the
above natural operations, and the projection 7r is a surjective linear map
from V to V IN.
Theorem 4.3. If T is in Hom(V, W), and if the null space of T includes the
subspace lIf C V, then T has a unique factorization through V I lIf. That is,

there exists a unique transformation S in Hom(V1M, W) such that T =
S07r.

Proof. Since T is zero on lIf, it follows that T is constant on each coset A of lIf,
so that T[A] contains only one vector. If we define S(A) to be the unique
vector in T[A], then S(a) = T(a), so So 7r = T by definition. Conversely, if
T = R 0 7r, then R(a) = R 0 7r(a) = T(a), and R is our above S. The linearity
of S is practically obvious. Thus
S(a

+ m=

S(a

+ (3) =

T(a

+ (3) =

T(a)

+ T({3)

= S(a)

+ S(m,

and homogeneity follows similarly. This completes the proof. 0
One more remark is of interest here. If N is invariant under a linear map
T in Hom V (that is, T[N] eN), then for each a in V, T[a] is a subset of the
coset T(a), for
T[a]

K E Hom(V IN, V) such that R = K 0 7r. Show that for any coset A of N the action

4.14 If we remember that the linear span 1.,(.1) of a subset .1 of a vector space V can
be defined as the intersection of all the subspaces of V that include .1, then the fact
that the intersection of any collection of affine subspaces of a vector space V is either
an affine subspace or empty suggests that we define the affine span .1J(A) of a nonempty
subset A C V as the intersection of all affine subspaces including A. Then we know
from (3) in our list of affine properties that .1J(.I) is an affine subspace, and by its
definition above that it is the smallest affine subspace including A. We now naturally
wonder whether M(A) can be directly described in terms of linear combinations.

5. DIRECT SUMS

We come now to the heart of the chapter. It frequently happens that the study
of some phenomenon on a vector space V leads to a finite collection of subspaces
{Vi} such that V is naturally isomorphic to the product space IIi Vi. Under
this isomorphism the maps (h 0 7r i on the product space become certain maps
Pi in Hom V, and the projection-injection identities are reflected in the identities
"'£Pi = I, P j 0 P j = P j for all .1, and Pi 0 P j = 0 if i ¢ i Also, Vi = range
Pi. The product structure that V thus acquires is then used to study the phenomenon that gave rise to it. For example, this is the way that we unravel the
structure of a linear transformation in Hom V, the study of which is one of the
central problems in linear algebra.
SUIllS. If VI, ... , V n are subspaces of the vector space V, then the
mapping 7r: <aI,"" a n >- ~ "'£7 ai is a linear transformation from II~ Vi
to V, since it is the sum 7r = "'£7 7ri of the coordinate projections.

Definition. We shall say that the Vi's are independent if 7r is injective and

that V is the direct sum of the Vi's if 7r is an isomorphism. We express the
latter relationship by writing V = VI EEl ... EEl V n = EB7 Vi.
Thus V = EBi=I Vi if and only if 7r is injective and surjective, i.e., if and
only if the subspaces {Vig are both independent and span V. A useful restate-

ment of the direct sum condition is that each a E V is uniquely expressible as
a sum :E~ ai, with ai E Vi for all i; a has some such expression because the V/s
span V, and the expression is unique by their independence.
For example, let V = e(lR) be the space of real-valued continuous functions
on IR, let V. be the subset of even functions (functions f such that f( -x) = f(x)
for all x), and let Vo be the subset of odd functions (functions such that f( -x) =
-f(x) for all x). It is clear that V. and Vo are subspaces of V, and we claim that
V = V. EB Yo' To see this, note that for any f in V, O(x) = (j(x) f( -x))/2
is even, h(x) = (j(x) - f( -x)) /2 is odd, and f = 0 h. Thus V = V.
Yo'
Moreover, this decomposition of f is unique, for if f = 01
hI also, where 01
is even and hI is odd, then 0 - 01 = hI - h, and therefore 0 - 01 = 0 =
hI - h, since the only function that is both even and odd is zero. The even-odd

plane, then M and N are complementary subspaces. Moreover, these are
nontrivial complementary pairs in IRs, The rea.der will be asked to prove
some of these facts in the exercises and they all will be clear by the middle of
the next chapter.
The following lemma is technically useful.

ao = 0, with ao E Yo. Therefore, a 1 = ao = 0 by the independence of

Definition. We call aj the jth component of a, and we call the linear map

P j = 7rj 0 7r- 1 the projection of V onto Vi (with respect to the given direct
sum decomposition of V). Since each a in V is uniquely expressible as a sum
a = 2:1 ai, with ai in Vi for all i, we can view Pj(a) = aj as "the part of
a in V;".

This use of the word "projection" is different from its use in the Cartesian
product situation, and each is different from its use in the quotient space context (Section 0.12). It is apparent that these three uses are related, and the
ambiguity causes little confusion since the proper meaning is always clear from
the context.

The above projection properties are clearly the reflection in V of the projection-injection identities for the isomorphic space IIi Vi.
A converse theorem is also true.
Theorelll 5.2. If {Pi}i c Hom V satisfy :Li Pi = I and Pi 0 P j = 0 for
i ¢ j, and if we set Vi = range Pi, then V = EB?=l Vi, and Pi is the
corresponding projection on Vi.

P1"Oof. The equation a = lea) = Ei PiCa) shows that the subspaces {Vi} i
span V. Next, if fJ E Vj, then Pi(fJ) = 0 for i ¢ j, since fJ E range P j and
Pi 0 P j = 0 if i ¢ j.
Then also P;({3) = (I - Ei+j P i )({3) = 1({3) = (3.
Now consider a = Ei ai for any choice of ai E Vi. Using the above two facts,
we have Pj(a) = Pj(E?=l ai) = Ei=l Pj(ai) = aj. Therefore, a = 0 implies
that aj = Pj(O) = 0 for all j, and the subspaces Vi are independent.
Consequently, V = EBi Vi. Finally, the fact that a = E PiCa) and PiCa) E Vi
for all i shows that P j(a) is the jth component of a for every a and therefore that
P j is the projection of V onto Vj. 0

There is an intrinsic characterization of the kind of map that is a projection.
Lelllllla 5.4. The projections Pi are idempotent (Pr = Pi), or, equivalently,
each is the identity on its range. The null space of Pi is the sum of the spaces
V j for j ¢ i.

Proof. PJ = P j 0 (I - Ei+j Pi) = P j 0 I = Pj. Since this can be rewritten
as Pj(Pj(a» = Pj(a) for every a in V, it says exactly that P j is the identity
on its range.
Now set Wi = Ei+i V;, and note that if (3 E Wi, then P i ({3) = 0 since
Pi[Vj] = 0 for j ¢ i. Thus Wi C N(P i ). Conversely, if PiCa) = 0, then a =
lea) = Ei Pj(a) = Ej+i Pj(a) E Wi. Thus N(Pi) C Wi, and the two spaces
are equal. 0

Conversely:
Lelllllla 5.5. If P E Hom(V) is idempotent, then V is the direct sum of its

range and null space, and P is the corresponding projection on its range.
Proof. Setting Q = I - P, we have PQ = P - p 2 = O. Therefore, V is the
direct sum of the ranges of P and Q, and P is the corresponding projection on its
range, by the above theorem. Moreover, the range of Q is the null space of P,
by the coronary. 0

If V = M E9 Nand P is the corresponding projection on M, we call P the
p1"Ojection on M along N. The projection P is not determined by M alone, since

M does not determine N. A pair P and Q in Hom V such that P
PQ = QP = 0 is called a pair of complementary projections.

In the above discussion we have neglected another fine point. Strictly
speaking, when we form the sum 7r = L~ 7r i, we are treating each 7r j as though
it were from II~ Vi to V, whereas actually the codomain of 7rj is Vj. And we
want P j to be from V to V, whereas 7rj 0 7r- 1 has codomain Vj, so the equation
P j = 7rj 0 7r- 1 can't quite be true either. To repair these flaws we have to
introduce the injection Lj: Vj ---+ V, which is the identity map on Vj, but which
views V j as a subspace of V and so takes Vas its codomain. If our concept of a
mapping includes a codomain possibly larger than the range, then we have to
admit such identity injections. Then, setting ifj = Lj 0 7rj, we have the correct
equations 7r = L~ ifi and P j = ifj 0 7r- 1 •

On solving a linear equation. 1\fany important problems in mathematics are

in the following general form. A linear operator T: V ---t W is given, and for a
given 1/ E W the equation T(~) = 1/ is to be solved for ~ E V. In our terms, the
condition that there exist a solution is exactly the condition that 1/ be in the
range space of T. In special circumstances this condition can be given more or
less useful equivalent alternative formulations. Let us suppose that we know
how to recognize R(T), in which case we may as well make it the new codomain,
and so assume that T is surjective. There still remains the problem of determining what we mean by solving the equation. The universal principle running
through all the important instances of the problem is that a solution process
calculates a right inverse to T, that is, a linear operator S: W ---t V such that
To S = I w , the identity on W. Thus a solution process picks one solution
vector ~ E V for each 1/ E W in such a way that the solving ~ varies linearly with
1/. Taking this as our meaning of solving, we have the following fundamental
reformulation.
TheoreIll 5.3. Let T be a surjective linear map from the vector space V

to the vector space W, and let N be its null space. Then a subspace M is a
complement of N if and only if the restriction of T to M is an isomorphism
from M to W. The mapping M ~ (T M)-1 is a bijection from the set
of all such complementary subspaces M to the set of all linear right inverses
of T.

Proof. It should be clear that a subspace M is the range of a linear right inverse
of T (a map S such that T 0 S = I w) if and only if T M is an isomorphism to W,
in which caseS = (T M)-l. Strictly speaking, the right inverse must be from
W to V and therefore must be R = LM 0 S, where LM is the identity injection
from M to V. Then (R 0 T)2 = R 0 (T 0 R) 0 T = R 0 Iw 0 T = RoT, and
RoT is a projection whose range is M and whose null space is N (since R is
injective). Thus V = M Ef) N. Conversely, if V = M Ef) N, then T M is
injective because JI.f n N = {O} and surjective because M
N = V implies
that W = T[V] = T[JI.f N] = T[M]
T[N] = T[M]

where Ck = Li+j=k aibj = Lf=o aibk-i. N ow let T be any fixed element of
Hom(V), and for any polynomial q(t) let q(T) be the transformation obtained
by replacing t by T. That is, if q(t) = L~ Cktk, then q(T) = L~ CkTk, where, of
course, Tl is the composition product ToT 0 • • • 0 T with l factors. Then the
bilinearity of composition (Theorem 3.3) shows that if p(t) = PI (t)P2(t),
then p(T) = PI(T) 0 P2(T). In particular, any two polynomials in T commute
with each other under composition. More simply, the commutative law for
addition implies that
if p(t) = PI(t)

+ P2(t),

then p(T) = PI(T)

+ P2(T).

The mapping p(t) 1---+ p(T) from the algebra of polynomials to the algebra
Hom(V) thus preserves addition, multiplication, and (obviously) scalar mUltiplication. That is, it preserves all the operations of an algebra and is therefore
what is called an (algebra) homomorphism.
The word "homomorphism" is a general term describing a mapping 8
between two algebraic systems of the same kind such that 8 preserves the
operations of the system. Thus a homomorphism between vector spaces is
simply a linear transformation, and a homomorphism between groups is a
mapping preserving the one group operation. An accessible, but not really
typical, example of the latter is the logarithm function, which is a homomorphism
from the multiplicative group of positive real numbers to the additive group of ~.
The logarithm function is actually a bijective homomorphism and is therefore
a group isomorphism.
If this were a course in algebra, we would show that the division algorithm
and the properties of the degree of a polynomial imply the following theorem.

Theorem 5.4. If PI(t) and P2(t) are relatively prime polynomials, then there

By relatively prime we mean having no common factors except constants.
We shall assume this theorem and the results of the discussion preceding it in
proving our next theorem.
We say that a subspace MeV is invariant under T E Hom(V) if T[M] eM
[that is, T r M E Hom(M)].
Theorem 5.5. Let T be any transformation in Hom V, and let q be any
polynomial. Then the null space N of q(T) is invariant under T, and if
q = qlq2 is any factorization of q into relatively prime factors and N I and
N 2 are the null space of ql(T) and q2(T), respectively, then N = N I E9 N 2.
Proof. Since T 0 q(T) = q(T) 0 T, we see that if q(T) (a) = 0, then q(T)(Ta) =
T(q(T)(a)) = 0, so T[N] eN. Note also that since q(T) = ql(T) 0 q2(T),
it follows that any a in N 2 is also in N, so N 2 eN. Similarly, N leN. We can
therefore replace V by Nand T by T N j hence we can assume that T E Hom N
and q(T) = ql(T) 0 q2(T) = 0.
Now choose polynomials al and a2 so that alql a2q2 = 1. Since P 1--+ p(T)

q2(T) = I.

Set Al = al(T), etc., so that Al 0
0 Q2 =
I, QI 0 Q2 = 0, and all the
operators Ai, Qi commute with each other. Finally, set Pi = Ai 0 Qi = Qi 0 Ai
for i = 1,2. Then PI + P 2 = I and P IP 2 = P 2P I = 0. Thus PI and P 2 are
projections, and N is the direct sum of their ranges: N = V I E9 V 2. Since each
range is the null space of the other projectivn, we can rewrite this as N =
N I E9 N 2, where Ni = N(P i ). It remains for us to show that N(P i ) = N(Qi).
Note first that since QI 0 P 2 = QI 0 Q2 0 A2 = 0, we have QI = QI 0 I =
QI 0 (PI + P 2) = QI 0 Pl' Then the two identities Pi = Ai 0 Qi and Qi =
Qi 0 Pi show that the null space of each of Pi and Qi is included in the other, and
so they are equal. This completes the proof of the theorem. 0
Corollary. Let p(t) = rrf'=l Pi(t) be a factorization of the polynomial
p(t) into relatively prime factors, let T be an element of Hom(Il), and set
Ni = N(Pi(T)) for i = 1, ... ,m and N = N(p(T)). Then N and all the
Ni are invariant under T, and N = EBf'=1 N i .
Proof. The proof is by induction on m. The theorem is the case m = 2, and if
we set q = rr~ Pi(t) and M = N(q(T)), then the theorem implies that
N = N I E9 M and that N I and M are invariant under T. Restricting T to M,
we see that the inductive hypothesis implies that M = EBf'=2 Ni and that Ni is
invariant under T for i = 2, ... ,m. The corollary to Lemma 5.3 then yields
our result. 0

5.21 In the context of Theorem 5.5, show that the restriction of q2(T) = Q2 to N 1
is an isomorphism (from N 1 to N 1).
5.22 An involution on V is a mapping T EO Hom V such that T2 = 1. Show that if
T is an involution, then V is a direct sum V = Vi EB V 2, where T(~) = ~ for every
~ EO Vi (T = Ion Vi) and TW = -~ for every ~ EO 1'2 (T = -Ion V2). (Apply
Theorem 5.5.)
5.23 We noticed earlier (in an exercise) that if cp is any mapping from a set. t to a
set B, then fl----+ fo cp is a linear map T." from \R E to \R.i. Show now that if 1/;; B -> C,
then
(This "hould turn out to hr a direct const'qurnce of tht' associativity of composition.)
5.2,t Let. t be any set, and let cp; . t -> A be such that cp 0 cp(a) = a for ('very a.
Then T.,,;fl----+focp is an involution on V = \R.t (since T."oy, = Ty,o T.,,). Show that
the decomposition of \RR as the direct sum of the subspace of even functions and the
subspace of odd functions aris('s from an involution on \RR defined by such a map
cp; \R -> IR.
5.25 Let V be a subspace of \RR consisting of differentiable functions, and suppose
that V is invariant under differentiation (f EO V=} Df EO V). Suppose abo that on V
the linear operator D EO Hom V satisfies D2 - 2D - 31 = o. Prove that V is the
direct sum of two subspaces J[ and N such that D = 31 on J[ and D = -Ion N.
Actually, it follows that J[ is the linear span of a single vector, and similarly for N.
Find these two functions, if you can. (f' = 3f=} f = '?)
*Block decompositions of linear maps. Given T in Hom V and a direct sum
decomposition V = EB7 Vi, with corresponding projections {Pi}7, we can
consider the maps Tij = Pi 0 To Pj. Although Tij is from V to V, we may also
want to consider it as being from V j to Vi (in which case, strictly speaking, what
is it?). We picture the T;/s arranged schematically in a rectangular array
Similar to a matrix, as indicated below for n = 2.

Furthermore, since T = Li,j Tij, we call the doubly indexed family the block
decomposition of T associated with the given direct sum decomposition of V.
1\10re generally, if TEO Hom(V, W) and W also has a direct sum decomposition W = EBi=l Wi, with corresponding projections {Qi}'{', then the family
{Tij} defined by Tij = Qi 0 To P j and pictured as an m X n rectangular array
is the block decomposition of T with respect to the two direct sum decompositions.
Whenever T in Hom V has a special relationship to a particular direct sum
decomposition of V, the corresponding block diagram may have features that
display these special properties in a vivid way; this then helps us to understand
the nature of T better and to calculate with it more easily.

For example, if V = VI E9 V 2, then VIis invariant under T (i.e., T[V de VI)
if and only if the block diagram is upper triangular, as shown in the following
diagram.

Suppose, next, that T2 = O. Letting VI be the range of T, and supposing that
V 1 has a complement V 2, the reader should clearly see that the corresponding
block diagram is

This form is called strictly upper triangular; it is upper triangular and also zero
on the main diagonal. Conversely, if T has some strictly upper-triangular
2 X 2 block diagram, then T2 = O.
If R is a composition product, R = ST, then its block components can be
computed in terms of those of Sand T. Thus

6. BILINEARITY

Bilinear mappings. The notion of a bilinear mapping is important to the understanding of linear algebra because it is the vector setting for the duality
principle (Section 0.10).
Definition. If U, V, and Ware vector spaces, then a mapping

w:

-<~, 7]> ~ w(~,

7])

from U X V to W is bilinear if it is linear in each variable when the other
variable is held fixed.
That is, if we hold ~ fixed, then 7] ~ w(~, 7]) is linear [and so belongs to
Hom(V, W)]; if we hold 7] fixed, then similarly w(~, 7]) is in Rom(U, W) as a
function of~. This is not the same notion as linearity on the product vector
space U X V. For example, -< x, y > ~ x
y is a linear mapping from 1R2
to IR, but it is not bilinear. If y is held fixed, then the mapping x ~ x
y is
affine (translation through y), but it is not linear unless y is O. On the other
hand, -< x, y > ~ xy is a bilinear mapping from 1R2 to IR, but it is not linear. If y

+

+

68

1.6

VECTOR SPACES

is held fixed, then the mapping x ~ yx is linear. But the sum of two ordered
couples does not map to the sum of their images:
<x, y>

+ <u, v>

+ u, y + v> ~ (x + u)(y + v),
the images, xy + uv. Similarly, the scalar product
=

<x

which is not the sum of
(x, Y) = Ll XiYi is bilinear from IR n X IR n to IR, as we observed in Section 2.
The linear meaning of bilinearity is partially explained in the following
theorem.
Theorem 6.1. If w: U X V ~ W is bilinear, then, by duality, w is equivalent to a linear mapping from U to Hom(V, W) and also to a linear mapping
from V to Hom(U, W).
Proof. For each fixed TJ E V let w~ be the mapping ~ ~ w(~, TJ). That is,
w~w = w(~, TJ).
Then w~ E Hom(U, W) by the bilinear hypothesis. The
mapping TJ ~ w~ is thus from V to Hom(U, W), and its linearity is due to the
linearity of w in TJ when ~ is held fixed:
wCHd!"(O

=

w(~, CTJ

+ cit) =

cw(~, TJ)

+ ciwa, t) =

cw~W

+ ciw!"(~),

so that
Similarly, if we define w~ by w~(TJ) = w(~, TJ), then ~ ~ w~ is a linear mapping
from U to Hom(V, W). Conversely, if IP: U ~ Hom(V, W) is linear, then the
function w defined by w(~, TJ) = IP(O(TJ) is bilinear. Moreover, w~ = IP(~), so
that IP is the mapping ~ ~ w~. 0
We shall see that bilinearity occurs frequently. Sometimes the reinterpretation provided by the above theorem provides new insights; at other times it
seems less helpful.
For example, the composition map <S, T> ~ SoT is bilinear, and the
corollary of Theorem 3.3, which in effect states that composition on the right by
a fixed T is a linear map, is simply part of an explicit statement of the bilinearity.
But the linear map T ~ composition by T is a complicated object that we have
no need for except in the case W = lROn the other hand, the linear combination formula Ll Xi(Xi and Theorem 1.2
do receive new illumination.
Theorem 6.2. The mapping w(x, ex) = Ll Xi(Xi is bilinear from IR n X vn
to V. The mapping ex ~ Wa. is therefore a linear mapping from vn to
Hom(lR n , V), and, in fact, is an isomorphism.
Proof. The linearity of w in x for a fixed ex was proved in Theorem 1.2, and its
linearity in ex for a fixed x is seen in the same way. Then ex ~ Wa. is linear by
Theorem 6.1. Its bijectivity was implicit in Theorem 1.2. 0
It should be remarked that we can use any finite index set I just as well as
the special set'ii and conclude that w(x, ex) = LiEI Xi(Xi is bilinear from IRI X Vi

1.6

BILINEARITY

to V and that a 1-+ Wa. is an isomorphism from VI to Hom(~I, V). Also note
that Wa. = La. in the terminology of Section 1.
Corollary. The scalar product (x, a) = I:1 Xiai is bilinear from ~n X ~n
to ~; therefore, a 1-+ Wa = La is an isomorphism from ~n to Hom(~n, ~).
Natural isomorphisms. We often find two vector spaces related to each other

in such a way that a particular isomorphism between them is singled out. This
phenomenon is hard to pin down in general terms but easy to describe by
examples.
Duality is one source of such "natural" isomorphisms. For example, an
m X n matrix {iii} is a real-valued function of the two variables -< i,} >-, and
as such it is an element of the Cartesian space ~mXn. We can also view {iii} as
a sequence of n column vectors in ~m. This is the dual point of view where we
hold} fixed and obtain a function of i for each i From this point of view {iii}
is an element of (~m)n. This correspondence between ~mXn and (~m)n is clearly
an isomorphism, and is an example of a natural isomorphism.
We review next the various ways of looking at Cartesian n-space itself.
One standard way of defining an ordered n-tuplet is by induction. The ordered
triplet -< x, y, z>- is defined as the ordered pair -< -< x, y>- , z>- , and the ordered
n-tuplet -<XI, ... , xn>- is defined as -< -<XI, ... , Xn-l>-, x n >-. Thus we
define ~n inductively by setting ~l = ~ and ~n = ~n-l X ~.
The ordered n-tuplet can also be defined as the function on n = {I, ... , n}
which assigns Xi to i. Then

= {-<l,Xl>-,"" -<n,xn >-},
and Cartesian n-space is ~n = ~ (1, ... , nl .
-<Xl,""Xn >-

+

Finally, we often wish to view Cartesian (n
m)-space as the Cartesian
product of Cartesian n-space with Cartesian m-space, so we now take
as
as ~n X ~m.
Here again if we pair two different models for the same n-tuplet, we have an
obvious natural isomorphism between the corresponding models for Cartesian
n-space.
Finally, the characteristic properties of Cartesian product spaces given in
Theorems 3.6 and 3.7 yield natural isomorphisms. Theorem 3.6 says that an
n-tuple of linear maps {Tig on a common domain V is equivalent to a single
n-tuple-valued map T, where T(~) = -< Tl(~)"'" TnW >- for all ~ E V.
(This is duality again! TiW is a function of the two variables i and 0 And it is
not hard to see that this identification of T with {Tig is an isomorphism from
I1i Hom(V, Wi) to Hom(V, IIi Wi).
Similarly, Theorem 3.7 identifies an n-tuple of linear maps {T i }1 into a common codomain V with a single linear map T of an n-tuple variable, and this identification is a natural isomorphism from II1 Hom(W i , V) to Hom(II1 Wi, V).

VECTOR SPACES

l.G

An arbitrary isomorphism between two vector spaces identifies them in a
transient way. For the moment we think of the vector spaces as representing the
same abstract space, but only so long as the isomorphism is before us. If we
shift to a different isomorphism between them, we obtain a new temporary
identification. Natural isomorphisms, on the other hand, effect permanent
identifications, and we think of paired objects as being two aspects of the same
object in a deeper sense. Thus we think of a matrix as "being" either a sequence
of row vectors, a sequence of column vectors, or a single function of two integer
indices. We shall take a final look at this question at the end of Section 3 in the
next chapter.
*We can now make the ultimate dissection of the theorems centering
around the linear combination formula. Laws Sl through S3 state exactly that
the scalar product xa is bilinear. l\Iore precisely, they state that the mapping
s: -< x, a >- ~ xa from IR X W to W is bilinear. In the language of Theorem G.1,
xa = w",(x), and from that theorem we conclude that the mapping a ~ w'" is
an isomorphism from W to Hom(lR, W).
This isomorphism between Wand Hom(lR, W) extends to an isomorphism from wn to (Hom(lR, W)) n, which in turn is naturally isomorphic to
Hom(lRn,W) by the second Cartesian product isomorphism. Thus wn is naturally isomorphic to Hom(lR n , W); the mapping is a ~ La., where La.(x) =
L~

Xiai·

In particular, IR n is naturally isomorphic to the space Hom(lR n , IR) of all
linear functionals on IR n , the n-tuple a corresponding to the functional Wa
defined by wa(x) = L~ aiXi.
Also, (IRrn)n is naturally isomorphic to Hom(lR n , 1R1n). And since IRmXn is
naturally isomorphic to (IRrn)n, it follows that the spaces IRmXn and Hom(lR n , IRrn)
are naturally isomorphic. This is simply our natural association of a transformation Tin Hom(lR n , IRm) to an m X n matrix {tij}.

CHAPTER 2

FINITE-DIMENSIONAL VECTOR SPACES

We have defined a vector space to be finite-dimensional if it has a finite spanning
set. In this chapter we shall focus our attention on such spaces, although this
restriction is unnecessary for some of our discussion. We shall see that we can
assign to each finite-dimensional space V a unique integer, called the dimension
of V, which satisfies our intuitive requirements about dimensionality and which
becomes a principal tool in the deeper explorations into the nature of such
e;paces. A number of "dimensional identities" are crucial in these further
investigations. We shall find that the dual space of all linear functionals on V,
V* = Hom(V, IR), plays a more satisfactory role in finite-dimensional theory
than in the context of general vector spaces. (However, we shall see later in
the book that when we add limit theory to our algebra, there are certain special
infinite-dimensional vector spaces for which the dual space plays an equally
important role.) A finite-dimensional space can be characterized as a vector
space isomorphic to some Cartesian space IR n , and such an isomorphism allows a
transformation T in Hom V to be "transferred" to IR n , whereupon it acquires a
matrix. The theory of linear transformations on such spaces is therefore mirrored
eompletely by the theory of matrices. In this chapter we shall push much
deeper into the nature of this relationship than we did in Chapter 1. We also
include a section on matrix computations, a brief section describing the trace
and determinant functions, and a short discussion of the diagonalization of a
quadratic form.
I. BASES

Consider again a fixed finite indexed set of vectors a = {ai: i E I} in V and the
corresponding linear combination map La.: x f---+ L Xiai from IRI to V having a
lie; skeleton.
Definition. The finite indexed set {ai: i E I} is independent if the above
mapping La. is injective, and {ai} is a basis for V if La. is an isomorphism
(onto V). In this situation we call {ai: i E J} an ordered basis or frame if
J = n = {I, ... , n} for some positive integer n.

Thus {ai : i E J} is a basis if and only if for each ~ E V there exists a unique
illdexed "coefficient" set x = {Xi: i E I} E IRI such that ~ = L Xiai. The
71

72

numbers Xi always exist because {ai: i E I} spans V, and x is unique because
La. is injective.
For example, we can check directly that hI = -< 2, 1>- and h 2 = -< 1, -3 >form a basis for jR2. The problem is to show that for each y E jR2 there is a
unique x such that

Since this vector equation is equivalent to the two scalar equations YI =
2XI + X2 and Y2 = Xl - 3X2, we can find the unique solution Xl = (3YI + Y2)/7,
X2 = (YI - 2Y2)/7 by the usual elimination method of secondary school
algebra.
The form of these definitions is dictated by our interpretation of the linear
combination formula as a linear mapping. The more usual definition of independence is a corollary.
The independence of the finite indexed set {ai: i E I} is
equivalent to the property that LI Xiai = 0 only if all the coefficients Xi
are O.
Lelllllla I.I.

Proof. This is the property that the null space of La. consist only of 0, and is
thus equivalent to the injectivity of La., that is, to the independence of {ai} , by
Lemma 1.1 of Chapter 1. 0
If {ain is an ordered basis (frame) for V, the unique n-tuple x such that
L~ Xiai is called the coordinate n-tuple of ~ (with respect to the basis {ai}),
and Xi is the ith coordinate of~. We call Xiai (and sometimes Xi) the ith component
of~. The mapping La. will be called a basis isomorphism, and its inverse L;:l,
which assigns to each vector ~ E V its unique coordinate n-tuple x, is a coordinate
isomorphism. The linear functional ~ 1---+ Xi is the jth coordinate functional;
~

=

it is the composition of the coordinate isomorphism ~ 1---+ x with the jth coordinate projection x 1---+ Xi on jRn. We shall see in Section 3 that the n coordinate
functionals form a basis for V* = Hom(V, jR).
In the above paragraph we took the index set I to be n = {I, ... , n} and
used the language of n-tuples. The only difference for an arbitrary finite index
set is that we speak of a coordinate function x = {Xi: i E I} instead of a coordinate n-tuple.
Our first concern will be to show that every finite-dimensional (finitely
spanned) vector space has a basis. We start with some remarks about indices.
We note first that a finite indexed set {ai: i E I} can be independent only
if the indexing is injective as a mapping into V, for if ak = aI, then L Xiai = 0,
where Xk = 1, Xl = -1, and Xi = 0 for the remaining indices. Also, if {ai : i E l}
is independent and J C I, then {ai : i E J} is independent, since if LJ Xiai = 0,
and if we set Xi = 0 for i E I - J, then LI Xiai = 0, and so each xi is o.
A finite unindexed set is said to be independent if it is independent in some

2.1

BASES

73

(necessarily bijective) indexing. It will of course then be independent with
respect to any bijective indexing. An arbitrary set is independent if every finite
subset is independent. It follows that a set A is dependent (not independent) if
and only if there exist distinct clements al> ..• , an in A and scalars Xl, . . . , xn
not all zero such that L7 x,;a,; = o. An unindexed basis would be defined in the
obvious way. However, a set can always be regarded as being indexed, by itself
if necessary!
Lemma 1.2. If B is an independent subset of a vector space V and {3 is any
vector not in the linear span L(B), then B U {{3} is independent.

Proof. Otherwise there is a zero linear combination, ;r{3 + L~ :r,;{3,- = 0, where
•.. , {3n arc distinct clements of B and the coefficients are not all O. But then
X cannot be zero: if it were, the equation would contradict the independence of
B. We can therefore divide by;'/: and solve for {3, so that {3 E L(B), a contradiction. 0

{3 I>

The reader will remember that we call a vector space V finite-dimensional
if it has a finite spanning set {aJ 7. We can use the above lemma to construct a
basis for such a V by choosing some of the a/so We simply run through the
sequence {aig and choose those members that increase the linear span of the
preceding choices. We end up with a spanning set since {aig spans, and our
subsequence is independent at each step, by the lemma. In the same way we
can extend an independent set {{3i} 7 to a basis by choosing some members of a
spanning set {ai} 7. This procedure is intuitive, but it is messy to set up rigorously. We shall therefore proceed differently.
Theorem 1.1. Any minimal finite spanning set is a basis, and therefore any
finite-dimensional vector space V has a basis. More generally, if {{3j : j E J}
is a finite independent set and {ai: i E J} is a finite spanning set, and if K
is a smallest subset of J such that {{3j} J U {ai} K spans, then this collection is
independent and 2, basis. Therefore, any finite independent subset of a
finite-dimensional space can be extended to a basis.

Proof. It is sufficient to prove the second assertion, since it includes the first
as a special case. If {{3j} J U {ai} K is not independent, then there is a nontrivial
zero linear combination LJ Yj{3j
LK Xiai = O. If every Xi were zero, this
pquation would contradict the independence of {{3j} J. Therefore, some Xk is
Ilot zero, and we can solve the equation for ak. That is, if we set L = K - {k},
then the linear span of {{3j} J U {ai} L contains ak. It therefore includes the whole
original spanning set and hence is V. But this contradicts the minimal nature of
K, since L is a proper subset of K. Consequently, {{3j} J U {aJ K is independent. 0

We next note that

~n

itself has a very special basis. In the indexing map

,: ~ ai the vector aj corresponds to the index j, but under the linear combiIlation map x ~ L Xiai the vector aj corresponds to the function oj which has
t he value 1 at j and the value 0 elsewhere, so that Li o{ai = aj. This function

74

2.1

FINITE-DIMENSIONAL VECTOR SPACES

~j is called a Kronecker delta function. It is clearly the characteristic function XB
of the one-point set B = {J}, and the symbol ,~j, is ambiguous, just as 'XB'
is ambiguous; in each case the meaning depends on what domain is implicit from
the context. We have already used the delta functions on ~n in proving Theorem
1.2 of Chapter 1.

Theorem 1.2. The Kronecker functions {~j}i=l form a basis for ~n.

Proof. Since Li Xi~i(j) = Xj by the definition of ~i, we see that L~ Xi~i is
the n-tuple x itself, so the linear combination mapping L5: x 1--+ L~ Xi~i is the
identity mapping x 1--+ x, a trivial isomorphism. 0

Among all possible indexed bases for ~n, the Kronecker basis is thus singled
out by the fact that its basis isomorphism is the identity; for this reason it is
called the standard basis or the natural basis for ~n. The same holds for ~l for
any finite set I.
Finally, we shall draw some elementary conclusions from the existence of
a basis.
Theorem 1.3. If T E Hom(V, W) is an isomorphism and a =
is a basis for V, then {T(ai) : i E I} is a basis for W.

{ai: i E I}

Proof. By hypothesis Lo. is an isomorphism in Hom(~n, V), and so To Lo. is
an isomorphism in Hom(~n, W). Its skeleton {T(ai)} is therefore a basis for W. 0

We can view any basis {ai} as the image of the standard basis {~i} under
the basis isomorphism. Conversely, any isomorphism 8: ~l --t B becomes a basis
isomorphism for the basis aj = 8(~j).
Theorem 1.4. If X and Yare complementary subspaces of a vector space V,

then the union of a basis for X and a basis for Y is a basis for V. Conversely,
if a basis for V is partitioned into two sets, with linear spans X and Y,
respectively, then X and Yare complementary subspaces of V ..
Proof. We prove only the first statement. If {ai : i E J} is a basis for X and
{ai: i E K} is a basis for Y, then it is clear that {ai : i E J uK} spans V, since
its span includes both X and Y, and so X
Y = V. Suppose then that
LJUK Xiai = O. Setting ~ = LJ Xiai and 7J = LK Xiai, we see that ~ E X,
7J E Y, and ~
7J = O. But then ~ = 7J = 0, since X and Yare complementary.
And then Xi = 0 for i E J because {ai} J is independent, and Xi = 0 for i E K
because {ai} K is independent. Therefore, {ai} JUK is a basis for V. We leave the
converse argument as an exercise. 0

If we follow a coordinate isomorphism by a linear combination map, we get
the mapping of the following existence theorem, which we state only in n-tuple
form.

1.5. If {3 = {l1i} ~ is an ordered basis for the vector space V, and
if {ai} ~ is any n-tuple of vectors in a vector space W, then there exists a
unique S E Hom(V, W) such that S(l1i) = ai for i = 1, ... , n.
Theorelll

Proof. By hypothesis L~ is an isomorphism in Hom(!R n , V), and so
S = La. 0 (L~)-1 is an clement of Hom(V, W) such that S(l1i) = La.(oi) = ai.
Conversely, if S E Hom(V, W) is such that S(l1i) = ai for all i, then S 0 L~( oi) =
ai for all i, so that S 0 L~ = La.. Thus S is uniquely determined as La. 0 (L~) -1. 0
It is natural to ask how the unique S above varies with the n-tuple {ai}.
The answer is: linearly and "isomorphically".
Theorelll

1.6. Let {l1i} ~ be a fixed ordered basis for the vector space

V, and for each n-tuple a = {aig chosen from the vector space W let
Sa. E Hom(V, W) be the unique transformation defined above. Then the
map a ~ Sa. is an isomorphism from
to Hom(V, W).

wn

Proof. As above, Sa. = La. 0 (r\ where 0 is the basis isomorphism L~. N"ow we
know from Theorem 6.2 of Chapter 1 that a ~ La. is an isomorphism from wn
to Hom(!R n , W), and composition on the right by the fixed coordinate isomorphism 0- 1 is an isomorphism from Hom(!R n , W) to Hom(V, W) by the corollary
to Theorem 3.3 of Chapter 1. Composing these two isomorphisms gives us the
theorem. 0
*Infinite bases. Most vector spaces do not have finite bases, and it is natural to
try to extend the above discussion to index sets I that may be infinite. The
Kronecker functions {oi : i E I} have the same definitions, but they no longer
span !R I . By definition f is a linear combination of the functions oi if and only
if f is of the form LiEI! Cioi, where II is a finite subset of I. But then f = 0
outside of I l' Conversely, if f E !R I is 0 except on a finite set 111 then f =
LiEI J( i) oi. The linear span of {oi : i E I} is thus exactly the set of all functions of !R I that are zero except on a finite set. We shall designate this subspace !RI.
If {ai: i E I} is an indexed set of vectors in V and f E !R I , then the sum
LiEI f(i)ai becomes meaningful if we adopt the reasonable convention that the
sum of an arbitrary number of O's is O. Then LiEI = LiEIo' where lois any
finite subset of I outside of which f is zero.
With this convention, La.:f ~ Ld(i)ai is a linear map from !RI to V, as in
Theorem 1.2 of Chapter 1. And with the same convention, LiEI f(i)ai is an
elegant expression for the general linear combination of the vectors ai. Instead
of choosing a finite subset II and numbers Ci for just those indices i in II, we
define Ci for all i E I, but with the stipulation that Ci = 0 for all but a finite
number of indices. That is, we take c = {Ci: i E I} as a function in !RI.

We make the same definitions of independence and basis as before. Then
{ai: i E l} is a basis for V if and only if La.: IRI ~ V is an isomorphism, i.e., if
and only if for each ~ E V there exists a unique x E IRI such that ~ = Li Xiai.

By using an axiom of set theory called the axiom of choice, it can be shown
that every vector space has a basis in this sense and that any independent set
can be extended to a basis. Then Theorems 1.4 and 1.5 hold with only minor
changes in notation. In particular, if a basis for a subspace 111 of V is extended
to a basis for V, then the linear span of the added part is a subspace N complementary to M. Thus, in a purely algebraic sense, every subspace has complementary subspaces. We assume this fact in some of our exercises.
The above sums are always finite (despite appearances), and the above
notion of basis is purely algebraic. However, infinite bases in this sense are not
very useful in analysis, and we shall therefore concentrate for the present on
spaces that have finite bases (i.e., are finite-dimensional). Then in one important context later on we shall discuss infinite bases where the sums are genuinely
infinite by virtue of limit theory.

2. DIMENSION

The concept of dimension rests on the fact that two different bases for the same
space always contain the same number of elements. This number, which is
then the number of elements in every basis for V, is called the dimension of V.
It tells all there is to know about V to within isomorphism: There exists an
isomorphism between two spaces if and only if they have the same dimension.
We shall consider only finite dimensions. If V is not finite-dimensional, its
dimension is an infinite cardinal number, a concept with which the reader is
probably unfamiliar.
Lemma 2.1. If V is finite-dimensional and T in Hom V is surjective, then T
is an isomorphism.

Proof. Let 11 be the smallest number of elements that can span V. That is, there
is some spanning set {a;} 7 and none with fewer than n elements. Then {ai} 7 is a
basis, by Theorem 1.1, and the linear combination map 0: x f---> 2::7 Xiai is
accordingly a basis isomorphism. But {iJJ 7 = {T(ai)} 7 also spans, since T is
surjective, and so ToO is also a basis isomorphism, for the same reason. Then
T = (T 0 0) 0 0- 1 is an isomorphism. 0
Theorem 2.1. If V is finite-dimensional, then all bases for V contain the
same number of elements.

Proof. Two bases with nand m elements determine basis isomorphisms
0: IR n ~ V and cp: 1R1n ~ V. Suppose that m < n and, viewing IR n as IR rn X IR n - m ,

78
let

2.2

FINITE-DIMEXSIONAL VECTOR SPACES
7r

be the projection of IR n onto IR m,

Since T = 0- 1 0 cp is an isomorphism from IRm to IR n and To 7r: IR n ~ IR n is
therefore surjective, it follows from the lemma that T 0 7r is an isomorphism.
Then 7r = T- l 0 (T 0 7r) is an isomorphism. But it isn't, because 7r(on) = 0,
and we have a contradiction. Therefore no basis can be smaller than any other
basis. D
The integer that is the number of elements in every basis for V is of course
called the dimension of V, and we designate it d(V). Since the standard basis
{oi} ~ for IR n has n elements, we see that IR n is n-dimensional in this precise sense.
Corollary. Two finite-dimensional vector spaces are isomorphic if and only

if they have the same dimension.
Proof. If T is an isomorphism from V to Wand B is a basis for V, then T[B] is a
basis for W by Theorem 1.3. Therefore d(V) = #B = #T[B] = d(W), where
#A is the number of elements in A. Conversely, if d(V) = d(W) = n, then V
and Ware each isomorphic to IR n and so to each other. D
Theorem 2.2. Every subspace M of a finite-dimensional vector space V is

finite-dimensional.
Proof. Let a be the family of finite independent subsets of M. By Theorem 1.1,
if A E a, then A can be extended to a basis for V, and so #A ~ d(V). Thus
{#A : A E a} is a finite set of integers, and we can choose B E a such that
n = #B is the maximum of this finite set. But then L(B) = M, because otherwise for any a E ]J[ - L(B) we have B U {a} E a, by Lemma 1.2, and
#(B U {a}) = n

+ 1,

contradicting the maximal nature of n. Thus M is finitely spanned. D
Corollary. Every subspace ]J[ of a finite-dimensional space V has a comple-

ment.
Proof. Use Theorem 1.1 to extend a basis for M to a basis for V, and let N be
the linear span of the added vectors. Then apply Theorem 1.4. D

We now prove two basic dimensional identities.
We will always assume V finite-dimensional.

Corollary. If W is finite-dimensional and deW) = dey), then T is injective

3. THE DUAL SPACE

Although throughout this section all spaces will be assumed finite-dimensional,
many of the definitions and properties are valid for infinite-dimensional spaces
as well. But for such spaces there is a difference between pmely algebraic
situations and situations in which algebra is mixed with hypotheses of continuity.
One of the blessings of finite dimensionality is the absence of this complication.
As the reader has probably surmised from the number of special linear functionals
we have met, particularly the coordinate functionals, the space Hom(V, IR)
of all linear functionals on V plays a special role.

82

2.3

FINITE-DIMENSIONAL VECTOR SPACES

Definition. The dual space (or conjugate space) V* of the vector space V is

the vector space Hom(V, IR) of all linear mappings from V to IR. Its elements
are called linear functionals.
Weare going to see that in a certain sense V is in turn the dual space of
V* (V and (V*)* are naturally isomorphic), so that the two spaces are symmetrically related. We shall briefly study the notion of annihilation (orthogonality) which has its origins in this setting, and then see that there is a natural
isomorphism between Hom(V, W) and Hom(W*, V*). This gives the mathematician a new tool to use in studying a linear transformation Tin Hom(V, W);
the relationship between T and its image T* exposes new properties of T itself.
Dual bases. At the outset one naturally wonders how big a space V* is, and we
settle the question immediately.
Theorem 3.1. Let {f3i}~ be an ordered basis for V, and let ej be the corre-

sponding jth coordinate functional on V: ej(l;) = Xi> where
Then {ejg is an ordered basis for V*.

~

Proof. Let us first make the proof by a direct elementary calculation.

for
a) Independence. Suppose that L~ Cjej = 0, that is, L~ Cjej(O =
all ~ E V. Taking ~ = f3i and remembering that the coordinate n-tuple of f3i
is ~i, we see that the above equation reduces to Ci = 0, and this for all i. Therefore, {ej}~ is independent.
b) Spanning. First note that the basis expansion ~ = L Xif3i can be rewritten ~ = L ei(~)f3i' Then for any A E V* we have A(~) = L~ liei(~)'
where we have set li = A(f3i). That is, A = L liei. This shows that {ej} ~ spans
V*, and, together with (a), that it is a basis. D
Definition. The basis {ej} for V* is called the dual of the basis {f3i} for V.

As usual, one of our fundamental isomorphisms is lurking behind all this,
but we shall leave its exposure to an exercise.
Corollary. d(V*)

The three equations

ei(~)

are worth looking at. The first two are symmetrically related, each presenting
the basis expansion of a vector with its coefficients computed by applying the
corresponding element of the dual basis to the vector. The third is symmetric
itself between ~ and A.
Since a finite-dimensional space V and its dual space V* have the same
dimension, they are of course isomorphic. In fact, each basis for V defines an
isomorphism, for we have the associated coordinate isomorphism from V to IR n ,
the dual basis isomorphism from IR n to V*, and therefore the composite isomor-

2.3

THE DUAL SPACE

83

phism from V to V*. This isomorphism varies with the basis, however, and there
is in general no natural isomorphism between V and V*.
It is another matter with Cartesian space IR n because it has a standard
basis, and therefore a standard isomorphism with its dual space (IRn)*. It is
not hard to see that this is the isomorphism a 1-+ La, where La(x) = L~ aiXi,
that we discussed in Section 1.6. We can therefore feel free to identify IR n with
(IRn)*, only keeping in mind that when we think of an n-tuple a as a linear
functional, we mean the functional La(x) = L~ aiXi.
The second conjugate space. Despite the fact that V and V* are not naturally

isomorphic in general, we shall now see that V is naturally isomorphic to V** =
(V*)*.
TheorelD 3.2. The function w: V X V* ~ IR defined by w(~, f) = f(O is

bilinear, and the mapping ~

1-+

w~

from V to V** is a natural isomorphism.

Proof. In this context we generally set ~** = w~, so that ~** is defined by
~**(f) = fW for all f E V*. The bilinearity of w should be clear, and Theorem
6.1 of Chapter 1 therefore applies. The reader might like to run through a
direct check of the linearity of ~ 1-+ ~** starting with (Cl h
C2 ~2) **(1).
There still is the question of the injectivity of this mapping. If a ~ 0, we
can find f E V* so that f(a) ~ O. One way is to make a the first vector of an
ordered basis and to takefas the first functional in the dual basis; thenf(a) = 1.
Since a**(f) = f(a) ~ 0, we see in particular that a** ~ O. The mapping
~ ~ ~** is thus injective, and it is then bijective by the corollary of Theorem
2.4. 0

+

If we think of V** as being naturally identified with V in this way, the two
Hpaces V and V* are symmetrically related to each other. Each is the dual of
t.he other. In the expression 'f(~)' we think of both symbols as variables and
t.hen hold one or the other fixed for the two interpretations. In such a situation
we often use a more symmetric symbolism, such as (~,f), to indicate our intent.ion to treat both symbols as variables.

{Xi} is the basis in V* dual to the basis {ai} in V, then
{ai*} is the basis in V** dual to the basis {Xi} in V*.

LelDlDa 3.1. If

1'l'oof. We have ai*(Xj) = Xj(ai) = 5}, which shows that a{* is the ith coordinate projection. In case the reader has forgotten, the basis expansion f = L CjXj
implies that ai*(f) = f(ai) = (L CjXj) (ai) = Ci, so that ai* is the mapping
J 1-+ Ci. 0
Annihilator subspaces. It is in this dual situation that orthogonality first
naturally appears. However, we shall save the term 'orthogonal' for the latter
enntext in which V and V* have been identified through a scalar product, and
shall speak here of the annihilator of a set rather than its orthogonal complement.

The adjoint of T. We shall now see that with every T in Hom(V, W) there is
naturally associated an element of Hom(W*, V*) which we call the adjoint of
T and designate T*. One consequence of the intimate relationship between T
and T* is that the range of T* is exactly the annihilator of the null space of

T. Combined with our dimensional identities, this implies that the ranges of T
and T* have the same dimension. And later on, after we have established the
connection between matrix representations of T and T*, this turns into the very
mysterious fact that the dimension of the linear span of the row vectors of an mby-n matrix is the same as the dimension of the linear span of its column vectors,
which gives us our notion of the rank of a matrix. In Chapter 5 we shall study a
situation (Hilbert space) in which we are given a fixed fundamental isomorphism
between V and V*. If T is in Hom V, then of course T* is in Hom V*, and we
can use this isomorphism to "transfer" T* into Hom V. But now T can be com-

be self-adjoint. It turns out that the self-adjoint transformations are "nice" ones,
as we shall see for ourselves in simple cases, and also, fortunately, that many
important linear maps arising from theoretical physics are self-adjoint.
If T E Hom(V, W) and l E W*, then of course loT E V*. Moreover, the
mapping l ~ loT (T fixed) is a linear mapping from W* to V* by the corollary
to Theorem 3.3 of Chapter 1. This mapping is called the adjoint of T and is
designated T*. Thus T* E Hom(W*, V*) and T*(l) = loT for all l E W*.
Theorelll 3.4. The mapping T ~ T* is an isomorphism from the vector

space Hom(V, W) to the vector space Hom(W*, V*). Also (T ° S)* =
S* ° T* under the relevant hypotheses on domains and codomains.
Proof. Everything we have said above through the linearity of T ~ T* is a
consequence of the bilinearity of w(l, T) = loT. The map we have called T*
is simply WT, and the linearity of T ~ T* thus follows from Theorem 6.1 of
Chapter 1. Again the reader might benefit from a direct linearity check, beginc2T2)*(l).

To see that T ~ T* is injective, we take any T .,t. 0 and choose a E V so
that T(a) .,t. O. We then choose l E W* so that l(T(a») .,t. o. Since l(T(a») =
(T*(l») (a), we have verified that T* .,t. o.
Next, if d(V) = m and d(W) = n, then also d(V*) = m and d(W*) = n .

Finally, (T ° S)*l = lo (T ° S) = (loT) ° S = S*(l ° T) = S*(T*(l») =
(S* ° T*)l, so that (T ° S)* = S* ° T*. D

The reader would probably guess that T** becomes identified with T under
the identification of V with V**. This is so, and it is actually the reason for
calling the isomorphism ~ ~ ~** natural. We shall return to this question at the

Therefore, N(T*) = (R(T»)o. The other proof is similar and will be left to the
reader. [Start with a E N(T) and end with a E (R(T*»)o.] D

The rank of a linear transformation is the dimension of its range space.
Corollary. The rank of T* is equal to the rank of T.

Proof. The dimensions of R(T) and (N(T»)O are each d(V) - d(N(T») by
Theorems 2.4 and 3.3, and the second is d(R(T*») by the above theorem.
Therefore, d(R(T») = d(R(T*»). D

*Natural isomorphisms again. We are now in a position to illustrate more
precisely the notion of a natural isomorphism. We saw above that among all the
isomorphisms from a finite-dimensional vector space V to its second dual, we
could single one out naturally, namely, the map ~ ~ ~**, where ~**(f) = f(~)
for all f in V*. Let us call this isomorphism cpv. The technical meaning of the
word 'natural' pertains to the collection {cpv} of all these isomorphisms; we
found a way to choose one isomorphism CPV for each space V, and the proof that
this is a "natural" choice lies in the smooth way the various cpv's relate to each
other. To see what we mean by this, consider two finite-dimensional spaces V
and Wand a map Tin Hom(V, W). Then T* is in Hom(W*, V*) and T** =
(T*)* is in Hom(V**, W**). The setting for the four maps T, T**, cpv, and CPW
can be displayed in a diagram as follows:
V _ _----.::T'--___ W

'I'~j

j'l'w

T**
V * * - - - - - - - W**

The diagram indicates two maps, CPw 0 T and T** 0 cpv, from V to W**, and we
define the collection of isomorphisms {cpv} to be natural if these two maps are
always equal for any V, Wand T. This is the condition that the two ways of
going around the diagram give the same result, i.e., that the diagram be commutative.
Put another way, it is the condition that T "become" T** when V is identified with V** (by cpv) and W is identified with W** (by cpw). We leave its proof
as an exercise.

4. MATRICES
Matrices and linear transforlllations. The reader has already learned something
about matrices and their relationship to linear transformations from Chapter 1;
we shall begin our more systematic discussion by reviewing this earlier material.
By popular conception a matrix is a rectangular array of numbers such as

Note that the first index numbers the rows and the second index numbers the
columns. If there are m rows and n columns in the array, it is called an m-by-n
(m X n) matrix. This notion is inexact. A rectangular array is a way of picturing
a matrix, but a matrix is really a function, just as a sequence is a function. With
the notation m = {I, ... , m}, the above matrix is a function assigning a number to every pair of integers -< i, j>- in m X n. It is thus an element of the set
IR,mXn. The addition of two m X n matrices is performed in the obvious placeby-place way, and is merely the addition of two functions in IR,mX7i; the same is
true for scalar multiplication. The set of all m X n matrices is thus the vector
space IR,mXn, a Cartesian space with a rather fancy finite index set. We shall use
the customary index notation tij for the value t(i, j) of the function t at -< i, j>-,
and we shall also write {tij} for t, just as we do for sequences and other indexed
collections.
The additional properties of matrices stem from the correspondence between
m X n matrices {tij} and transformations T E Hom(lR,n, IR,m).
The following theorem restates results from the first chapter. See Theorems
1.2, 1.3, and 6.2 of Chapter 1 and the discussion of the linear combination map
at the end of Section 1.6.

Theorem 4.1. Let {tij} be an m-by-n matrix, and let t

is itsjth column for j = 1, ... , n. Then there is a unique TinHom(~n, ~m)
such that skeleton T = {tj} , i.e., such that T( oj) = t j for all j. T is defined
as the linear combination mapping x ~ y = 2:.1=1 Xjt j, and an equivalent
presentation of T is the collection of scalar equations

Each T in Hom(~n, ~m) arises this way, and the bijection {tij}

~

T from

The only additional remark called for here is that in identifying an m X n
matrix with an n-tuple of m-tuples, we are making use of one of the standard
identifications of duality (Section 0.10). We are treating the natural isomorphism
between the really distinct spaces ~mXn and (~m)n as though it were the identity.
We can also relate T to {tij} by way of the rows of {tij}. As above, taking
ith coordinates in the m-tuple equation y = 2:.1=1 Xjt j, we get the equivalent
and familiar system of numerical (scalar) equations Yi = 2: 1=1 tijXj for
i = 1, ... ,m. Now the mapping x ~ 2:1=1 CjXj from ~n to ~ is the most general linear functional on ~n. In the above numerical equations, therefore, we
have simply used the m rows of the matrix {tij} to present the m-tuple of linear
functionals on ~n which is equivalent to the single m-tuple-valued linear
mapping T in Hom(~n, ~m) by Theorem 3.6 of Chapter 1.
The choice of ordered bases for arbitrary finite-dimensional spaces V and W
allows us to transfer the above theorem to Hom(V, W). Since we are now going
to correlate a matrix t in ~mXn with a transformation Tin Hom(V, W), we shall
designate the transformation in Hom(~n, ~m) discussed above by T.
Theorem 4.2. Let {ajg and {Ili} 7 be ordered bases for the vector spaces V
and W, respectively. For each matrix {tij} in ~mXn let T be the unique

element of Hom(V, W) such that T(aj) = 2:7'=1 tiif3i for j = 1, ... , n.
Then the mapping {tij} ~ T is an isomorphism from ~mXn to Hom(V, W).
1'1'oof. We simply combine the isomorphism {tij} ~ T of the above theorem
with the isomorphism T ~ T = 1/; 0 To cp-1 from Hom(~n, ~m) to Hom(V, W),
where cp and 1/; are the two given basis isomorphisms. Then T is the transformation described in the theorem, for T(aj) = 1/;(T(cp-1(aj»)) = 1/;(T(oj») =
f(t;) = 2:7'=1 tijlli' The map {tij} ~ T is the composition of two isomorphisms
alld so is an isomorphism. 0

It is instructive to look at what we have just done in a slightly different way.
(:iven the matrix {tij}, let Tj be the vector in W whose coordinate m-tuple is the
.It h column t j of the matrix, so that T j = 2:~ 1tijlli. Then let T be the unique
(·lement of Hom(V, W) such that T(aj) = Tj for j = 1, ... ,n. Now we have
()btained T from {tij} in the following two steps: T corresponds to the n-tuple

and {T j} ~ corresponds to the matrix {tij} by extension of the coordinate isomorphism between W and ~m to its product isomorphism from wn to (~m)n.

coordinate n-tuple of ~ in V (with respect to the given bases), then." = T(~)

Proof. We know that the scalar equations are equivalent to y = T(x), which is
the equation y = ",,-1 0 To <p(x). The isomorphism"" converts this to the
equation." = T(~). 0
Our problem now is to discover the matrix analogues of relationship between
linear transformations. For transformations between the Cartesian spaces ~n
this is a fairly direct, uncomplicated business, because, as we know, the matrix
here is a natural alter ego for the transformation. But when we leave the Cartesian spaces, a transformation T no longer has a matrix in any natural way, and
only acquires one when bases are chosen and a corresponding T on Cartesian
spaces is thereby obtained. All matrices now are determined with respect to
chosen bases, and all calculations are complicated by the necessary presence of
the basis and coordinate isomorphisms. There are two ways of handling this
situation. The first, which we shall follow in general, is to describe things
directly for the general space V and simply to accept the necessarily more complicated statements involving bases and dual bases and the corresponding loss in
transparency. The other possibility is first to read off the answers for the
Cartesian spaces and then to transcribe them via coordinate isomorphisms.
Lemma 4.1. The matrix element tkj can be obtained from T by the formula

where fJ.k is the kth element of the dual basis in W*.
Proof. fJ.k(T(aj))

= fJ.k(Li"=1 tij{Ji) = Li tijfJ.k(fJ;) = Li tij

c5~

= tkj. 0

In terms of Cartesian spaces, T(c5 j ). is the jth column m-tuple t j in the
matrix {tij} of T, and tkj is the kth coordinate of tj. From the point of view of
linear maps, the kth coordinate is obtained by applying the kth coordinate
projection 'Irk, so that tkj = 'lrk(T(c5 j)). Under the basis isomorphisms, 'Irk
becomes fJ.k, T becomes T, c5 j becomes aj, and the Cartesian identity becomes
the identity of the lemma.

Definition. The row space of the matrix {tii} E ~mXn is the subspace of ~n
spanned by the m row vectors. The column space is similarly the span of
the n column vectors in ~m.
Corollary. The row and column spaces of a matrix have the same dimension.

Proof. If T is the element of Hom(~n, ~m) defined by T(~i) = ti, then the
set {tin of column vectors in the matrix {tii} is the image under T of the standard basis of ~n, and so its span, which we have called the column space of the
matrix, is exactly the range of T. In particular, the dimension of the column
space is d(R(T)) = rank T.
Since the matrix of T* is the transpose t* of the matrix t, we have, similarly,
t.hat rank T* is the dimension of the column space of t*. But the column space
of t* is the row space of t, and the assertion of the corollary is thus reduced to
the identity rank T* = rank T, which is the corollary of Theorem 3.5. 0
This common dimension is called the rank of the matrix.
Matrix products. If T E Hom(~n, ~m) and 8 E Hom(~m, ~l), then of course
R = 80 T E Hom(~n, ~l), and it certainly should be possible to calculate the

matrix r of R from the matrices sand t of 8 and T, respectively. To make this
eomputation, we set y = T(x) and z = 8(y), so that z = (8 0 T)(x) = R(x).
The equivalent scalar equations in terms of the matrices t and s are

We thus have found the formula for the matrix r of the map R = 80 T: x - t z.
Of course, r is defined to be the product of the matrices sand t, and we write
r = s . t or r = st.
Note that in order for the product st to be defined, the number of columns
ill the left factor must equal the number of rows in the right factor. We get the
clement rki by going across the kth row of s and simultaneously down the jth

resulting products. This process is illustrated in Fig. 2.1. In terms of the scalar
product (x, y) = L~ XiYi on ~n, we see that the element Tkj in r = st is the
scalar product of the kth row of s and the jth column of t.

Since we have defined the product of two matrices as the matrix of the
product of the corresponding transformations, i.e., so that the mapping T ~ {tij}
preserves products (8 0 T ~ st), it follows from the general principle of
Theorem 4.1 of Chapter 1 that the algebraic laws satisfied by composition of
transformations will automatically hold for the product of matrices. For
example, we know without making an explicit computation that matrix multiplication is associative. Then for square matrices we have the following theorem.
Theorem 4.4. The set M n of square n X n matrices is an algebra naturally

isomorphic to the algebra

Hom(~n).

Proof, We already know that T ~ {tij} is a natu~al linear isomorphism from
Hom(~n) to l\f n (Theorem 4.1), and we have defined the product of matrices
so that the mapping also preserves multiplication. The laws of algebra (for an
algebra) therefore follow for M n from our observation in Theorem 3.5 of Chapter
1 that they hold for Hom(~n). 0

The identity I in Hom(~n) takes the basis vector oj into itself, and therefore
its matrix e has oj for its jth column: e j = oj. Thus eij = o{ = 1 if i = j
and eij = o{ = 0 if i ~ f. That is, the matrix e is 1 along the main diagonal
(from upper left to lower right) and 0 elsewhere. Since I ~ e under the algebra
isomorphism T ~ t, we know that e is the identity for matrix multiplication.
Of course, we can check this directly: LJ=l tijejk = tik, and similarly for multiplying by e on the left. The symbol 'e' is ambiguous in that we have used it
to denote the identity in the space ~nXn of square n X n matrices for any n.
Corollary. A square n X n matrix t has a multiplicative inverse if and only
if its rank is n.

Proof. By the theorem there exists an 8 E M n such that 8t = t8 = e if and
only if there exists an 8 E Hom(lR n ) such that 8 0 T = T 0 8 = I. But such
an 8 exists if and only if T is an isomorphism, and by the corollary to Theorem 2.4
this is equivalent to the dimension of the range of T being n. But this dimension
is the rank of t, and the argument is complete. D

A square matrix (or a transformation in Hom V) is said to be nonsingular
if it is invertible.
Theorem 4.5. If {ai}~' {j3j}i', and {'Yk}11 are ordered bases for the vector spaces U, V, and lV, respectively, and if T E Hom(U, V) and
8 E Hom(V, lV), then the matrix of 80 T is the product of the matrices

of 8 and T (with respect to the given bases).
Proof. By definition the matrix of 80 T is the matrix of 8 0 T = X-I 0 (8 0 T) 0 cp
in Hom(lR n , 1R1), where cp and x are the given basis isomorphisms for U and lV.
But if I/; is the basis isomorphism for V, we have
80 T =

(x- 1 0801/;) 0 (1/;-1 0 To cp) = ;S 0 T,

and therefore its matrix is the product of the matrices of ;S and T by the definition of matrix multiplication. The latter are the matrices of 8 and Twith respect
to the given bases. Putting these observations together, we have the theorem. D
There is a simple relationship between matrix products and transposition.
Theorem 4.6. If the matrix product 8t is defined, then so is t*8*, and
t*8* = (8t)*.

Proof. A direct calculation is easy. We have

This identity is clearly the matrix form of the transformation identity

We can view an n-tuple x = -<Xb"" xn>
as being alternatively either an n X 1 matrix, in which case we call it a column
vector, or a 1 X n matrix, in which case we call it a row vector. Of course, these
identifications are natural isomorphisms. The point of doing this is, in part, that
then the equations Yi = L.f=l tijXj say exactly that the column vector y is the
matrix product of t and the column vector x, that is, y = t· x. The linear map
Cartesian vectors as matrices.

T: IR n ~ IR m becomes left multiplication by the fixed matrix t when IR n is viewed as
the space of n X 1 column vectors. For this reason we shall take the column

vector as the standard matrix interpretation of an n-tuple x; then x* is the
corresponding row vector.

94

FINITE-DIME~SIONAL

VECTOU SPACES

In particular, a linear functional F E (IRn)* becomes left multiplication by
its matrix, which is of course 1 X n (F being from IR n to 1R1), and therefore is
simply the row matrix interpretation of an n-tuple in IRn. That is, in the natural
isomorphism a f-+ La from IR n to (IRn)*, where La(x) = L~ aiXi, the functional
La can now be interpreted as left matrix multiplication by the n-tuple a viewed
as the row vector a*. The matrix product of the row vector (1 X n matrix) a*
and the column vector (n X 1 matrix) x is a 1 X 1 matrix a*· x, that is, a
number.
Let us now see what these observations say about T*. The number La (T(x»
is the 1 X 1 matrix a*tx. Since La(T(x» = (T*(La»(x) by the definition of
T*, we see that the functional T*(La) is left multiplication by the row vector
a*t. Since the row vector form of La is a* and the row vector form of T*(La) is
a*t, this shows that when the functionals on IR n are interpreted as row vectors,
T* becomes right multiplication by t. This only repeats something we already
know. If we take transposes to throw the row vectors into the standard column
vector form for n-tuples, it shows that T* is left multiplication by t*, and so
gives another proof that the matrix of T* is t*.
Change of basis. If cP: x f-+ ~ = L~ xif3i and (j: y f-+ ~ = L~ Yif3i are two basis
isomorphisms for V, then A = (j-l 0 cP is the isomorphism in Hom(lR n) which
takes the coordinate n-tuple x of a vector ~ with respect to the basis {f3i} into the
coordinate n-tuple y of the same vector with respect to the basis {f3i}. The
isomorphism A is called the "change of coordinates" isomorphism. In terms
of the matrix a of A, we have y = ax, as above.
The change of coordinate map A = (j-l 0 cP should not be confused with the
similar looking T = (j 0 cP -1. The latter is a mapping on V, and is the element
of Hom(V) which takes each f3i to f3i.

We now want to see what happens to the matrix of a transformation
T E Hom(V, W) when we change bases in its domain and codomain spaces.
Suppose then that CPl and CP2 are basis isomorphisms from IRn to V, that 1/11 and 1/12
are basis isomorphisms from IR m to W, and that t' and t" are the matrices of T
with respect to the first and second bases, respectively. That is, t' is the matrix
of T' = (1/11)-1 0 To CPl E Hom(lRn, IR m ), and similarly for t". The mapping
A = cp;-1 0 CPl E Hom(lRn) is the change of coordinates transformation for
V: if x is the coordinate n-tuple of a vector ~ with respect to the first basis
[that is, ~ = CPl (x)], then A (x) is its coordinate n-tuple with respect to the second
basis. Similarly, let B be the change of coordinates map 1/1;-1 01/11 for W. The
diagram in Fig. 2.2 will help keep the various relationships of these spaces and

mappings straight. We say that the diagram is commutative, which means that
any two paths between two points represent the same map. By selecting various
pairs of paths, we can read off all the identities which hold for the nine maps
T, T', Til, <PI, <P2, A, 1/Ib 1/12, B. For example, Til can be obtained by going backward along A, forward along T', and then forward along B. That is, Til =
BoT' 0 A-I. Since these "outside maps" are all maps of Cartesian spaces, we
can then read off the corresponding matrix identity
til

bt'a- 1,

showing how the matrix of T with respect to the second pair of bases is obtained
from its matrix with respect to the first pair.
What we have actually done in reading off the above identity from the
diagram is to eliminate certain retraced steps in the longer path which the
definitions would give us. Thus from the definitions we get

In the above situation the domain and codomain spaces were different, and
the two basis changes were independent of each other. If W = V, so that
T E Hom(V), then of course we consider only one basis change and the formula
becomes
t" = a· t' . a-I.

Now consider a linear functional FE V*. If f" and f' are its coordinate
n-tuples considered as column vectors (n X 1 matrices), then the matrices of F
with respect to the two bases are the row vectors (f')* and (f")*, as we saw
earlier. Also, there is no change of basis in the range space since here W = IR,
with its permanent natural basis vector 1. Therefore, b = e in the formula
t" = bt'a-t, and we have (f")* = (f')*a- 1 or
f"

=

(a- 1 )*f'.

We want to compare this with the change of coordinates of a vector
which, as we saw earlier, is given by

~ E

V,

x" = ax'.

These changes go in the oppositive directions (with a transposition thrown in).
For reasons largely historical, functionals F in V* are called covariant vectors,
and since the matrix for a change of coordinates in V is the transpose of the
inverse of the matrix for the corresponding change of coordinates in V*, the
vectors ~ in V are called contravariant vectors. These terms are used in classical
tensor analysis and differential geometry.
The isomorphism {tij} f-t T, being from a Cartesian space IRmXn, is automatically a basis isomorphism. Its basis in Hom(V, W) is the image under the
isomorphism of the standard basis in IRmXn, where the latter is the set of
Kronecker functions ,p defined by ~kl(i, j) = 0 if <. k, l> ¢ <. i, j> and
~kl(k, l) = 1. (Remember that in IRA, ~a is that function such that ~a(b) = 0

pairs a = <. k, Z>-.) The function okl is that matrix whose columns are all 0
except for the lth, and the lth column is the m-tuple ok. The corrcsponding
tran"formation D'd thus takes every ba"is vector (Xj to 0 except (Xl and takes (Xl
to (3". That i", Dkl((Xj) = 0 if j r!= l, and Dk/((Xl) = (3k. Again, Dkl takes the lth
basi" vector in V to the !.th basis vector in TV and takes the other basis vectors
in V to O.
If ~ = L: :ri(Xi, it follows that Dkl(~) = XI(3".
Since {D kl } is the basis defined by the isomorphi"l1l {tij} ~ T, it follows
that {tij} is the coordinate set of T with respect to this basis; it is thc image of T
under the coordinate isomorphism. It is interesting to see how this basis expan"ion of T automatically appear::;. We have

Finally, we note that the matrix expression of T E Hom(lR. n , IR."') is very
suggestive of the block decompositions of T that we discussed earlier in Section

5. TRACE AND DETERMINANT

Our aim in this short section is to acquaint the reader with two very special
real-valued functions on Hom V and to describe some of their properties.
Theorem 5.1. If V is an n-dimensional vector space, there is exactly one
linear functional A on the vector space Hom(V) with the property that
A(S 0 T) = A(T 0 S) for all S, Tin Hom(V) and normalized so that A(I) = n.
If a basis is chosen for V and the corresponding matrix of T is {tij}, then
A(T) = L:i'=1 tii, the sum of the elements on the main diagonal.
Proof. If we choose a basis and define A(T) as L:~ tii, then it is clear that A is a
linear functional on Hom(V) and that A(I) = n. Moreover,

That is, each basis for V gives us a functional A in (Hom V) * such that A(S 0 T) =
A(T 0 S), A(l) = n, and A(T) = L: tii for the matrix representation of that basis.
N ow suppose that J..I. is any element of (Hom(V)) * such that J..I.(S 0 T) =
J..I.(T 0 S) and J..I.(I) = n. If we choose a basis for V and use the isomorphism
8: {tij} 1--+ T from ~nXn to Hom V, we have a functional v = J..I. 0 8 on ~nXn
(v = 8*J..I.) such that v(st) = v(ts) and v(e) = n. By Theorem 4.1 (or 3.1) v is
given by a matrix c, v(t) = L:i.j=1 Cijtij, and the equation v(st - ts) = 0
becomes L:i.j,k=1 Cij(Siktkj - Sjktki) = o.
Weare going to leave it as an exercise for the reader to show that if l rf m,
then very simple special matrices sand t can be chosen so that this sum reduces
to Clm = 0, and, by a different choice, to Cll - Cmm = O.
Together with the requirement that v(e) = n, this implies that Clm = 0 for
l rf m and Cmm = 1 for m = 1, ... ', n. That is, v(t) = L:~ t mm , and v is the
A of the basis being used. Altogether this shows that there is a unique A in
(Hom V)* such that A(S 0 T) = A(T 0 S) for all Sand T and A(I) = n, and that
A(T) has the diagonal evaluation as L: tii in every basis. 0
This unique A is called the trace functional, and A(T) is the trace of T. It is
usually designated tr(T).
The determinant function tl(T) on Hom V is much more complicated, and
we shall not prove that it exists until Chapter 7. Its geometric meaning is as
follows. First, [tl(T)[ is the factor by which T multiplies volumes. More precisely, if we define a "volume" v for subsets of V by choosing a basis and using
the coordinate correspondence to transfer to V the "natural" volume on ~n,
then, for any figure A C V, v(T[AJ) = [tl(T)/. v(A). This will be spelled out in
Chapter 8. Second, tl(T) is positive or negative according as T preserves or
reverses orientation, which again is a sophisticated notion to be explained later.
For the moment we shall list properties of tl(T) that are related to this geometric
interpretation, and we give a sufficient number to show the uniqueness of tl.

d) If V is one-dimensional, so that any Tin Hom(V) is simply multiplication
by a constant CT, then d(T) is that constant CT.
e) If V is two-dimensional and T interchanges a pair of independe~t vectors,
then d(T) = -1. This is clearly a pure orientation-changing property.
The fact that d is uniquely determined by these properties will follow from
our discussion in the next section, which will also give us a process for calculating
d. This process is efficient for dimensions greater than two, but for Tin Hom(1R2)
there is a simple formula for d(T) which every student should know by heart.
Theorem 5.2. If T is in Hom(1R2) and {tij} is its 2 X 2 matrix, then

d(T) =

tllt22 -

t 12 t 21 ·

This is a special case of a general formula, which we shall derive in Chapter 7,
that expresses d(T) as a sum of n! terms, each term being a product of n numbers
from the matrix of T. This formula is too complicated to be useful in computations for large n, but for n = 3 it is about as easy to use as our row-reduction
calculation in the next section, and for n = 2 it becomes the above simple
expression. There are a few more properties of d with which every student
should be familiar. They will all be proved in Chapter 7.
Theorem 5.3. If T isin Hom V, then d(T*) = d(T). If 8 is an isomorphism
from V to Wand S = (J 0 ToO-l, then d(S) = d(T).

Theorem 5.4. The transformation Tis nonsingular (invertible) if and only
if A(T) ~ O.

D(t)

Show that if Ll(s)

6. MATRIX COMPUTATIONS

The computational process by which the reader learned to solve systems of
linear equations in secondary school algebra was undoubtedly "elimination by
successive substitutions". The first equation is solved for the first unknown, and
the solution expression is substituted for the first unknown in the remaining
equations, thereby eliminating the first unknown from the remaining equations.
Next, the second equation is solved for the second unknown, and this unknown is
then eliminated from the remaining equations. In this way the unknowns are
eliminated one at a time, and a solution is obtained.
This same procedure also solves the following additional problems:
1) to obtain an explicit basis for the linear span of a set of m vectors in IRn;
therefore, in particular,
2) to find the dimension of such a subspace;
3) to compute the determinant of an m X m matrix;
4) to compute the inverse of an invertible m X m matrix.

2.6

MATRIX COMPUTATIONS

103

In this section we shall briefly study this process and the solutions to these
problems.
We start by noting that the kinds of changes we are going to make on a
finite sequence of vectors do not alter its span.
Lemma 6.1. Let {ai}'f be any m-tuple of vectors in a vector space, and let
{i3i} 'f be obtained from {ai} 'f by anyone of the following elementary
operations:
1) interchanging two vectors;
2) multiplying some ai by a nonzero scalar;
3) replacing ai by ai - xaj for some j ~ i and some x E R
Then
L( {i3iH) = L( {ai}'f).

Proof. If ai = ai - xaj, then ai = ai + Xaj. Thus if {i3i} 'f is obtained from
{ai}'f by one operation of type (3), then {ai}'f can be obtained from {i3i}'f by
one operation of type (3). In particular, each sequence is in the linear span of
the other, and the two linear spans are therefore the same.
Similarly, each of the other operations can be undone by one of the same
type, and the linear spans are unchanged. 0
When we perform these operations on the sequence of TOW vectors in a
matrix, we call them elementary row operations.
We define the order of an n-tuple x = <Xb"" x n > as the index of the
first nonzero entry. Thus if Xi = for i < j and Xj ~ 0, then the order of x
isj. The order of <0,0,0,2, -1,0> is 4.
Let {aij} be an m X n matrix, let V be its row space, and let nl < n2 <
... < nk be the integers that occur as orders of nonzero vectors in V. We are
going to construct a basis for V consisting of k elements having exactly the
above set of orders.
If every nonzero row in {aij} has order >p, then every nonzero vector x in
V has order> p, since x is a linear combination of these row vectors. Since some
vector in V has the minimal order nb it follows that some row in {aij} has order
1£1. We move such a row to the top by interchanging two rows. We then multiply
this row x by a constant, so that its first nonzero entry x n1 is 1. Let a 1, ... , an
be the row vectors that we now have, so that a 1 has order nl and a~l = 1. We
next subtract multiples of a 1 from each of the other rows in such a way that the
new ith row has as its nl-coordinate. Specifically, we replace a i by a i a
for i > 1. The matrix that we thus obtain has the property that its jth column
is the zero m-tuple for eachj < n1 and its n1th column is 15 1 in IRm. Its first row
has order nb and every other row has order >nl' Its row space is still V. We
again call it a.
Now let x = I:'f cia i be a vector in V with order n2. Then Cl = 0, for if
Cl ~ 0, then the order of x is nl. Thus x is a linear combination of the second

°

°

a;.l· 1

104

2.6

FINITE-DIMEXSIONAL VECTOR SPACES

to the mth rows, and, just as in the first case, one of these rows must therefore
have order n2.
We now repeat the above process all over again, keying now on this vector.
We bring it to the second row, make its n2-coordinate 1, and subtract multiples
of it from all the other rows (including the first), so that the resulting matrix
has 52 for its n2th column. Next we find a row with order n3, bring it to the
third row, and make the n3th column 53, etc.
We exhibit this process below for one 3 X 4 matrix. This example is dishonest in that it has been chosen so that fractions will not occur through the
application of (2). The reader will not be that lucky when he tries his hand.
Our defense is that by keeping the matrices simple we make the process itself
more apparent.

Note that from the final matrix we can tell that the orders in the row space
are 1, 2, and 4, whereas the original matrix only displays the orders 1 and 2.
We end up with an m X n matrix having the same row space V and the
following special structure:
1) For 1

:s; j :s;

k the jth row has order nj.

< m, the remaining m - k rows are zero (since a nonzero row would
have order >nk, a contradiction).

2) If k

3) The njth column is 5j •

It follows that any linear combination of the first k rows with coefficients
has Cj in the njth place, and hence cannot be zero unless all the
c/s are zero. These k rows thus form a basis for V, solving problems (1) and (2).
Our final matrix is said to be in row-reduced echelon form. It can be shown to
be uniquely determined by the space V and the above requirements relating its
rows to the orders of the elements of V. Its rows form the canonical basis of V.

A typical row-reduced echelon matrix is shown in Fig. 2.4. This matrix is 8 X 11,
its orders are 1, 4, 5, 7, 10, and its row space has dimension 5. It is entirely 0
below the broken line. The dashes in the first five lines represent arbitrary numbers, but any change in these remaining entries changes the spanned space V.
We shall now look for the significance of the row-reduction operations from
the point of view of general linear theory. In this discussion it will be convenient
to use the fact from Section 4 that if an n-tuplet in IR n is viewed as an n X 1
matrix (i.e., as a column vector), then the system of linear equations Yk =
L:.i=1 aiixj, i = 1, ... , m, expresses exactly the single matrix equation y = a' x.
Thus the associated linear transformation A E Hom(lR n, IRm) is now viewed as
being simply multiplication by the matrix a; y = A(x) if and only if y = a· x.

We first note that each of our elementary row operations on an m X n
matrix a is equivalent to premultiplication by a corresponding m X m elementary
matrix u. Supposing for the moment that this is so, we can find out what u
is by using the m X m identity matrix e. Since U· a = (u· e) . a, we see that
the result of performing the operation on the matrix a can also be obtained by
premultiplying a by the matrix u . e. That is, if the elementary operation can
be obtained as matrix multiplication by u, then the multiplier is u . e. This
argument suggests that we should perform the operation on e and then see if
premultiplying a by the resulting matrix performs the operation on a.
If the elementary operation is interchanging the ioth and ioth rows, then
performing it on e gives the matrix a with Ukk = 1 for k ~ io and k ~ io,
uioio = Uioio = 1 and Ukl = 0 for all other indices. Moreover, examination of
the sums defining the elements of the product matrix u . a will show that premultiplying by this u does just interchange the ioth and ioth rows of any
In X n matrix a.
In the same way, multiplying the ioth row of a by c is equivalent to premultiplying by the matrix u which is the same as e except that Uioio = c.
Finally, multiplying theioth row by x and adding it to the ioth row is equivalent
to premultiplying by the matrix u which is the identity e except that uioio is x
instead of O.

These elementary matrices u are all nonsingular (invertible). The row interchange matrix is its own inverse. The inverse of multiplying the jth row by e
is multiplying the same row by lie. And the inverse of adding e times the jth
row to the ith row is adding -e times the jth row to the ith row.
If u 1, u 2 , . . . , uP is a sequence of elementary matrices, and if

then b· a is the matrix obtained from a by performing the corresponding
sequence of elementary row operations on a. If u \ ... , uP is a sequence which
row reduces a, then r = b· a is the resulting row-reduced echelon matrix.
Now suppose that a is a square m X m matrix and is nonsingular (invertible).
Thus the dimension of the row space is m, and hence there are m different orders
n}, ... ,nk' That is, k = m, and since 1 ~ nl < n2 < ... < nm = m, we
must also have ni = i, i = 1, ... ,m. Remembering that the nith column in r is
5\ we see that now the ith column in r is 5i and therefore that r is simply the
identity matrix e. Thus b . a = e and b is the inverse of a.

Check it if you are in doubt.
Finally, since h· e = h, we see that we get h from e by applying the same
row operations (gathered together as premultiplication by h) that we used to
reduce a to echelon form. This is probably the best way of computing the inverse
of a matrix. To keep track of the operations, we can place e to the right of a to
form a single m X 2m matrix a I e, and then row reduce it. In echelon form it
will then be the m X 2m matrix e I h, and we can read off the inverse h of the
original matrix a.

Finally we consider the problem of computing the determinant of a square
m X m matrix. We use two elementary operations (one modified) as follows:
1') interchanging two rows and simultaneously changing the sign of one of
them;
2) as before, replacing some row ai by ai - xaj for some j ~ i.
When applied to the 1"OWS of a square matrix, these operations leave the determinant unchanged. This follows from the properties of determinants listed in
Section 5, and its proof will be left as an exercise. Moreover, these properties
will be trivial consequences of our definition of a determinant in Chapter 7.
Consider, then, a square m X m matrix {aij}. We interchange the first
and pth rows to bring a row of minimal order nl to the top, and change the sign
of the row being moved down (the first row here). We do not make the leading

108

2.6

FIXITE-DIMENSIONAL VECTOR SPACES

coefficient of the new first row 1; this elementary operation is not being used
now. We do subtract multiples of the first row from the remaining rows, in order
to make all the remaining entries in the nlth column O. The nlth column is now
C10 l , where Cl is the leading coefficient in the first row. And the new matrix has
the same determinant as the original matrix.
We continue as before, subject to the above modifications. We change the
sign of a row moved downward in an interchange, we do not make leading
coefficients 1, and we do clear out the njth column so that it becomes CjOn;,
where Cj is the leading coefficient of the jth row (1 ::=; j ::=; k). As before, the
remaining m - k rows are 0 (if k < m). Let us call this resulting matrix
semireduced. Note that we can find the corresponding reduced echelon matrix
from it by k applications of (2); we simply multiply the jth row by 1/ Cj for
j = 1, ... ,k. If s is the semi reduced matrix which we obtained from a using
(1') and (3), then we shall show below that its determinant, and therefore the
determinant of a also, is the product of the entries on the main diagonal: IIi= 1 sii.
Recapitulating, we can compute the determinant of a square matrix a by using
the operations (1') and (3) to change a to a semireduced matrix s, and then
taking the product of the numbers on the main diagonal of s.
If we apply this process to

we get

and the determinant is 1 . (-2) = -2. Our 2 X 2 determinant formula, applied
to

gives 1 . 4 - 2· 3 = 4 - 6 = -2.
If the original matrix {aij} is nons in gular, so that k = m and ni = i for
i = 1, ... , m, then the jth column in the semireduced matrix is CjOi, so that
Sjj = CiJ and we are claiming that the determinant is the product IIi=l Ci of the
leading coefficients.
To see this, note that if T is the transformation in Hom([Rn) corresponding
to our semireduced matrix, then T( oj) = CjO j , so that [Rn is the direct sum of n
T-invariant, one-dimensional subspaces, on the jth of which T is multiplication
by Cj. It follows from (c) and (d) of our list of determinant properties that
t:.(T) = II~ Cj = II~ Sjj. This is nonzero.
On the other hand, if {aij} is singular, so that k = d(V) < m, then the mth
row in the semi reduced matrix is 0 and, in particular, Smm = O. The product
IIi Sii is thus zero. Now, without altering the main diagonal, we can subtract
multiples of the columns containing the leading row entries (the columns with

2.6

MATRIX COMPUTATIONS

109

indices nj) to make the mth column a zero column. This process is equivalent
to postmultiplying by elementary matrices of type (2) and, therefore, again
leaves the determinant unchanged. But now the transformation S of this matrix
leaves ~m-l invariant (as the span of Clt, ... , Cl m - 1 in ~m) and takes Cl m to 0,
so that t.(S) = 0 by (c) in the list of determinant properties. So again the
determinant is the product of the entries on the main diagonal of the semireduced matrix, zero in this case.
We have also found that a matrix is nonsingular (invertible) if and only if its
determinant is nonzero.

*7. THE DIAGONALIZATION OF A QUADRATIC FORM

As we mentioned earlier, one of the crucial problems of linear algebra is the
analysis of the "structure" of a linear transformation T in Hom V. From the
point of view of bases, every theorem in this area asserts that with the choice
of a special basis for V the matrix of T can be given the such-and-such simple
form. This is a very difficult part of the subject, and ,ye are only making contact with it in this book, although Theorem 5.5 of Chapter 1 and its corollary
form a cornerstone of the structural results.
In this section we are going to solve a simpler problem. In the above language it is the problem of choosing a basis for V making simple the matrix of a
transformation T in Hom(V, V*). Such a transformation is equivalent to a
bilinear functional on V (by Theorem 6.1 of Chapter 1 and Theorem 3.2 of this
chapter); we shall tackle the problem in this setting.

112

2.7

FINITE-DIMENSIONAL VECTOR SPACES

Let V be a finite-dimensional real vector space, and let w: V X V ~ IR be
a bilinear functional. If {aig is a basis for V, then w determines a matrix
tij = w(ai' aj). We know that if w'l(~) = w(~, 7]), then W'l E V* and 7] 1-+ W'l is a
linear mapping T from V to V*. We leave it as an exercise for the reader to
show that {tij} is the matrix of T with respect to the basis {ai} for V and its
dual basis for V* (Exercise 4.1).
If ~ = L~ Xiai and 7] = L~ Yjaj, then

In particular, if we set q(~) = w(~, ~), then q(~) = Li,j tijXiXj is a homogeneous
quadratic polynomial in the coordinates Xi.
For the rest of this section we assume that w is symmetric: w(~, 7]) =
w(7], ~). Then we can recover w from the quadratic form q by

as the reader can easily check. In particular, if the bilinear form w is not identically zero, then there are vectors ~ such that q(~) =
~) ~ O.
What we want to do is to show that we can find a basis {aig for V such that
w(ai' aj) = 0 if i ~ j and w(ai' ai) has one of the three values 0, ± 1. Borrowing from the standard usage of scalar product theory (see Chapter 5), we say
that such a basis is orthonormal. Our proof that an orthonormal basis exists will
be an induction on n = dim V. If n = 1, then any nonzero vector (3 is a basis,
and if w({3, (3) ~ 0, then we can choose a = x{3 so that x 2 w({3, (3) = w(a, a) =
±I, the required value of X obviously being x = /w({3, (3)/-1/2. In the general
case, if w is the zero functional, then any basis will trivially be orthonormal, and
we can therefore suppose that w is not identically O. Then there exists a (3 such
that w({3, (3) ~ 0, as we noted earlier. We set an = x{3, where x is chosen to
make q(a n) = wean, an) = ±1. The nonzero linear functionalf(~) = w(~, an)
has an (n - I)-dimensional null space N, and if we let w' be the restriction of
w to N X N, then w' has an orthonormal basis {aig- 1 by the inductive hypothesis. Also w(ai' an) = wean, ai) = 0 if i < n, because ai is in the null space of f.
Therefore, {aig is an orthonormal basis for w, and we have reached our goal:

wa,

real vector space V, then V has an w-orthonormal basis.

where q( ai) = ± 1 or O. If we let V 1 be the span of those basis vectors ai for
which q(ai) = 1, and similarly for V -1 and V o, then we see that q(~) > 0 for
every nonzero ~ in V b q(~) < 0 for every nonzero vector ~ in V - b and q = 0

THE DIAGONALIZATION OF A QUADRATIC FORM

on Vo. Furthermore, V = V 1 9 V -1 9 V 0, and the three subspaces are
w-orthonormal to each other (which means that w{~, 71) = 0 if ~ E V 1 and
71 E V -1> etc.). Finally, q(~) ::; 0 for every ~ in V -1 9 Yo·
If we choose another orthonormal basis {~i} and let W 1, W -1, and W 0 be
its corresponding subspaces, then W 1 may be different from V 1, but their dimensions must be the same. For W 1 n (V -1 9 V 0) = {O}, since any nonzero ~
in this intersection would yield the contradictory inequalities q(~) > 0 and
q(~) ::; o. Thus W 1 can be extended to a complement of V -1 9 Yo, and since
V 1 is a complement, we have d(W 1) ::; d(V 1). Similarly, d(V 1) ::; d(W 1),
and the dimensions therefore are equal. Incidentally, this shows that W 1 is a
complement of V -1 9 Yo. In exactly the same way, we find that d(W -1) =
d(V -1) and finally, by subtraction, that d(W 0) = d(Vo). It is conventional to
reorder an w-orthonormal basis {ai} 1so that all the a/s with q(ai) = 1 come first,
then those with q(ai) = -1, and finally those with q(ai) = o. Our results
above can then be stated as follows:
Theorelll 7.2. If w is a symmetric bilinear functional on a finite-dimensional

space V, then there are integers nand p such that if {ai} '{' is any w-orthonormal basis in conventional order, and if ~ = L:,{, Xiai, then

The integer p - n is called the signature of the form q (or its associated
symmetric bilinear functional w), and p
n is its rank. Note that p
n is the
dimension of the column space of the above matrix of q, and hence equals the
dimension of the range of the related linear map T. Therefore, p
n is the
rank of every matrix of q.
An inductive proof that an orthonormal basis exists doesn't show us how to
find one in practice. Let us suppose that we have the matrix {tii} of w with
respect to some basis {aig before us, so that w(~, 71) = L: XiYitij, where
~
L:1 Xiai, 71 1:1 Yiai, and tii w(ai' ai), and we want to know how to go
about actually finding an orthonormal basis {~i} 1. The main problem is to find
an orthogonal basis; normalization is then trivial. The first objective is to find
a vector ~ such that w(~,
0;6- o. If some tii = w(ai' ai) is not zero, we can take
~ = ai. If all tii = 0 and the form w is not the zero form, there must be some
Iii 0;6- 0, say t12 0;6- O. If we set 1'1 = a1
a2 and I'i = ai for i > 1, then {I'ig
is a basis, and the matrix s = {Sii} of w with respect to the basis {-Y i} has

= W(I'1> 1'1) = w(a1 + a2, a1 + a2) = tll + 2t12 + t22 = 2t12 0;6- O.

Similarly, sii = tii if either i or j is greater than 1.
For example, if w is the bilinear form on 1R2 defined by w(x, y)
X2Y1, then its matrix tii = w(,si, ,si) is

[~ ~J'

=

+

114

2.7

FINITE-DIMENSIONAL VECTOR SPACES

and we must change the basis to get tt 1 ~ o. According to the above scheme,
we set 'Yl = 15 1
15 2 and 'Y2 = 15 2 and get the new matrix Sij = W('Yi' 'Yj),
which works out to

+

~].

[i

The next step is to find a basis for the null space of the functional w(~, 'Y 1) =
We do this by modifying 'Y 2, ... , 'Y n; we replace 'Y j by 'Y j
e'Y 1 and
calculate e so that this vector is in the null space. Therefore, we want 0 =
w('Yj
e'Yl, 'Yl) = Slj
eS11, and so e = -sljls11. Note that we cannot take
this orthogonalizing step until we have made Sl1 ~ o. The new set still spans
and thus is a basis, and the new matrix {rij} has r11 ~ 0 and rlj = rjl = 0 for
j > 1. We now simply repeat the whole procedure for the restriction of W to this
(n - I)-dimensional null space, with matrix {rij : 2 ~ i, j ~ n}, and so on.
This is a long process, but until we normalize, it consists only of rational operations on the original matrix. We add, subtract, multiply, and divide, but we
do not have to find roots of polynomial equations.
Continuing our above example, we set fh = 'Y b but we have to replace 'Y 2
by fJ2 = 'Y2 - (SI2Is11)'Y1 = 'Y2 - t'Yl. The final matrix rij = W(fJi, fJj)

(15 2 - 15 1 )/2.
The steps we had to take above are reminiscent of row reduction, but since
we are changing bases simultaneously in the domain and range spaces of the
transformation T: V ---? V* associated with w, each step involves simultaneously
premultiplying and postmultiplying by an elementary matrix. That is, we are
simultaneously row and column reducing. It should be intuitively clear that this
has to be the case if we are to operate on a symmetric matrix in such a way as
to keep it symmetric.
For additional information about quadratic forms, we go back to the change
of basis formula for the matrix of a transformation: til = b· t'· a-I. Here the
transformation T associated with the form w is from V to V*, and so b = (a*)-I,
according to our calculations in Section 4. Now one of the properties of the
determinant function is that d(T*) = d(T), and so d(a*) = d(a). Therefore,
if t and s are the matrices of a quadratic form with respect to a first and second
basis in V, and if a is the change of basis matrix, then s = (a*)-I. t· a-I and
deS) = (d(a- 1))2 d(t). Therefore, a quadratic form has parity. If it is nonsingular, then its determinant is either always positive or always negative, and

we can call it even or odd. In our continuing example, the beginning and final
matrices

[~

~]

and

both have determinant -1.
In the two-dimensional case, the determinant of a form with respect to an
orthonormalized basis is +1 if the diagonal elements are both +1 or both - 1,
and -1 if they are of opposite sign. We can therefore read off the signature of a
nonsingular form over a two-dimensional space without orthonormalizing. If the
determinant t11t22 - (t 12 )2 is positive, the signature is ±2, and we can determine which by looking at t11 (since t11 is then unchanged by our orthogonalizing
procedure). Thus the signature is +2 or -2 depending on whether tIl > 0 or
t11 < o. If the determinant is negative, then the signature is O. Thus the
signature of the form w(x, y) = X1Y2
X2Yr, with matrix

is known to be 0, without any calculation.
Theorems 7.1 and 7.2 are important for the classification of critical points
of real-valued functions on vector spaces. We shall see in Section 3.16 that the
second differential of such a function F is a symmetric bilinear functional, and
that the signature of its form has the same significance in determining the behavior of F near a point at which its first differential is zero that the sign of
the second derivative has in the elementary calculus.
A quadratic form q is said to be definite if q(~) is never zero except for ~ = O.
Then q(~) must always have the same sign, and q is accordingly called positive
definite or negative definite. Looking back to Theorem 7.2, it should be obvious
that q is positive definite only if p = dey) and n = 0, and negative definite
only if n = dey) and p = o. A symmetric bilinear functional whose associated
quadratic form is positive definite is called a scalar product. This is a very
important notion on general vector spaces, and the whole of Chapter 5 is devoted to developing some of its implications.

CHAPTER 3

THE DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS

Our algebraic background is now adequate for the differential calculus, but we
still need some multidimensional limit theory. Roughly speaking, the differential calculus is the theory of linear approximations to nonlinear mappings,
and we have to know what we mean by approximation in general vector settings.
We shall therefore start this chapter by studying the notion of a measure of
length, called a norm, for the vectors in a vector space V. We can then study
the phenomenon suggested by the way in which a tangent plane to a surface
approximates the surface near the point of tangency. This is the general theory
of unique local linear approximations of mappings, called differentials. The
collection of rules for computing differentials includes all the familiar laws of
the differential calculus, and achieves the same goal of allowing complicated
calculations to be performed in a routine way. However, the theory is richer
in the multidimensional setting, and one new aspect which we must master is
the interplay between the linear transformations which are differentials and their
evaluations at given vectors, which are directional derivatives in general and
partial derivatives when the vectors belong to a basis. In particular, when the
spaces in question are finite-dimensional and are replaced by Cartesian spaces
through a choice of bases, then the differential is entirely equivalent to its matrix,
which is a certain matrix of partial derivatives called the Jacobian matrix of the
mapping. Then the rules of the differential calculus are expressed in terms of
matrix operations.
Maximum and minimum points of real-valued functions are found exactly
as before, by computing the differential and setting it equal to zero. However,
we shall neglect this subject, except in starred sections. It also is much richer
than its one-variable counterpart, and in certain infinite-dimensional situations
it becomes the subject called the calculus of variations.
Finally, we shall begin our study of the inverse-mapping theorem and the
implicit-function theorem. The inverse-mapping theorem states that if a mapping
between vector spaces is continuously differentiable, and if its differential at a
point a is invertible (as a linear transformation), then the mapping itself is
invertible in the neighborhood of a. The implicit-function theorem states that if
a continuously differentiable vector-valued function G of two vector variables
is set equal to zero, and if the second partial differential of G is invertible (as a
linear mapping) at a point -< a, (3 >- where G(a, (3) = 0, then the equation

G(~7J) = 0 can be solved for 7J in terms of ~ near this point. That is, there is a
uniquely determined mapping 7J = F(~) defined near a such that (3 = F(a) and
such that G(~, F(~») = 0 in the neighborhood of a. These two theorems are
fundamental to the further development of analysis. They are deeper results
than our work up to this point in that they depend on a special property of
vector spaces called completeness; we shall have to put off part of their proofs to
the next chapter, where we shall study completeness in a fairly systematic way.
In a number of starred sections at the end of the chapter we present some
harder material that we do not expect the reader to master. However, he should
try to get a rough idea of what is going on.

I. REVIEW IN IR

Every student of the calculus is presumed to be familiar with the properties of
the real number system and the theory of limits. But we shall need more than
familiarity at this point. It will be absolutely essential that the student understand the E-definitions and be able to work with them.
To be on the safe side, we shall review some of this material in the setting of
limits of functions; the confident reader can skip it. We suppose that all the
functions we consider are defined at least on an open interval containing a,
except possibly at a itself. The need for this exception is shown by the difference
quotients of the calculus, which are not defined at the point near which their
hchavior is crucial.

THE DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS

For all x closer to a than ~ the value of f at x is closer to l than E. The
definition begins by stating that such a positive ~ can be found for each positive E.
Of course, ~ will vary with E; if E is made smaller, we will generally have to
go closer to a, that is, we will have to take ~ smaller, before all the values of f
on (a - ~, a
~)
{a} become E close to l.
The variables 'E' and '~' are almost always restricted to positive real numbers, and from now on we shall let this restriction be implicit unless there seems
to be some special call for explicitness. Thus we shall write simply ('v'E)(3~) ...
The definition of convergence is used in various ways. In the simplest
situations we are given one or more functions having limits at a, say, f(x) ---+ u
and g(x) ---+ v, and we want to prove that some other function h has a limit 10
at a. In such cases we always try to find an inequality expressing the quantity we
wish to make small, Ih(x) - 101, in terms of the quantities which we know can be
made small, If(x) - ul and Ig(x) - vi.
For example, suppose that h = f
g. Since f(x) is close to u and g(x) is
close to v, clearly hex) is close to 10 = U
v. But how close? Since hex) - 10 =
(f(x) - u)
(g(x) - v), we have

+ -

+
+

+

Ih(x) - 101 ::; If(x) -

ul + Ig(x)

-

vi.

From thi~ it is clear that in order to make Ih(x) - 101 less than E it is sufficient
to make each of If(x) - ul and Ig(x) - vi less than E/2. Therefore, given any E,
we can take ~l so that 0 < Ix - al < ~l => If(x) - ul < E/2, and ~2 so that
o < Ix - al < ~2 => Ig(x) - vi < E/2, and we can then take ~ as the smaller
of these two numbers, so that if 0 < Ix - al < ~, then both inequalities hold.
Thus

o<

Ix -

al < ~

=> Ih(x) - 101 ::; If(x) -

ul

+ Ig(x)

-

vi < ~ + ~ = E,

and we have found the desired ~ for the function h.
Suppose next that u r!= 0 and that h = l/f. Clearly, hex) is close to 10 = l/u
whenf(x) is close to u, and so we try to express hex) - 10 in terms of f(x) - u.
Thus
1
1
u - f(x)
hex) - 10 = f(x) - U = f(x)u '
and so Ih(x) - 101 ::; If(x) - ul/lf(x)ul. The trouble here is that the denominator is variable, and if it should happen to be very small, it might cancel the
smallness of If(x) - ul and not force a small quotient. But the answer to this
problem is easy. Sincef(x) is close to u and u is not zero, f(x) cannot be close to
zero. For instance, if f(x) is closer to u than lul/2, then f(x) must be farther
from 0 than lul/2. We therefore choose ~l so that 0 < Ix - al < ~l =>
If(x) - ul < lul/2, from which it follows that If(x) I > lul/2. Then

o < Jx - aJ < 02 => Jg(x) - vJ < E/2. Take 0 as the smaller of 01 and 02.

and we are done. 0
In addition to understanding E-techniques in limit theory, it is necessary to
understand and to be able to use the fundamental property of the real number
system called the least upper bound property. In the following statement of the
property the semi-infinite interval (- 00, a] is of course the subset {x E ~ : x :::; a}.
If A is a nonempty subset of ~ such that A c (- 00, a] for some a, then
there exists a uniquely determined smallest number b such that A C (- 00, b].

A number a such that A C (- 00, a] is called an upper bound of A; clearly, a
iH an upper bound of A if and only if every x in A is less than or equal to a.
A set having an upper bound is said to be bounded above. The property says that
a nonempty set A which is bounded above has a least upper bound (lub). If
we reverse the order relation by multiplying everything by -1, then we have the
alternative formulation which asserts that a nonempty subset of ~ that is
hounded below has a greatest lower bound (glb). The least upper bound of the
interval (0, 1) is 1. The least upper bound of [0, 1] is also 1. The greatest lower
hound of {1/n : n a positive integer} is O. Furthermore, lub {x : x is a positive
rational number and x 2 < 2} = 0, glb {ex: x E ~} = 0, and lub {ex: x is
rational and x < 0} = eV2•

rn the limit theory of IR, as reviewed briefly above, the absolute-value function

The limit theory of vector spaces is studied in terms of functions called

of a and pea - (3) as the "distance" between a and (3. However, if V is not
one-dimensional, there is no one notion of size that is most natural. For example,
if f is a positive continuous function on [a, b], and if we ask the reader for a
number which could be used as a measure of how "large" f is, there are two
possibilities that will probably occur to him: the maximum value of f and the area
Ilnder the graph of f. Certainly, f must be considered small if max f is small.
But also, we would have to agree that f is small in a different sense if its area is
small. These are two examples of norms on the vector space V = e([a, b]) of all
(·ontinuous functions on [a, b]:

\"ote that f can be small in the second sense and not in the first.
In order to be useful, a notion of size for a vector must have properties
analogous to those of the absolute-value function on IR.

-< V, p:>, but generally we speak simply of the normed linear space V, a definite
norm on V then being understood.
It has been customary to designate the norm of a by Iiall, presumably to
suggest the analogy with absolute value. The triangle inequality n3 then
becomes Iia + ~II :::; Iiall + II~II. which is almost identical in form with the basic
absolute-value inequality Ix + yl :::; Ixl + Iyl. Similarly, n2 becomes Ilxall =
Ixiliall, analogous to Ixyl = Ixllyl in IR. Furthermore, Iia - ~II is similarly
interpreted as the distance between a and~. This is reasonable since if we set
a = ~ - 71 and ~ = 71 - r, then n3 becomes the usual triangle inequality of
geometry:
II~ - rll :::; II~ - 7111 + 1171 - rll·
We shall use both the double bar notation and the "p"-notation for norms; each
is on occasion superior to the other.
The most commonly used norms on IR n are IlxilI = 1:7 lXii, the Euclidean
norm IIxl12 = (1:7 X~)I/2, and Ilxll oo = max {Ixil}i. Similar norms on the
infinite-dimensional vector space e([a, b)) of all continuous real-valued functions

It should be easy for the reader to check that II lit is a norm in both cases
above, and we shall take up the so-called uniform norms II 1100 in the next
paragraph. The Euclidean norms II 112 are trickier; their properties depend on
scalar product considerations. These will be discussed in Chapter 5. :Meanwhile,
so that the reader can use the Euclidean norm II 112 on IR n , we shall ask him to
prove the triangle inequality for it (the other axioms being obvious) by brute
force in an exercise. On IR itself the absolute value is a norm, and it is the only
norm to within a constant multiple.
We can transfer the above norms on IR n to arbitrary finite-dimensional
spaces by the following general remark.
Lemma 2.1. If p is a norm on a vector space Wand T is an injective linear
map from a vector space V to W, then poT is a norm on V.

Proof. The proof is left to the reader.
Uniform norms. The two norms II 1100 considered above are special cases of a
very general situation. Let A be an arbitrary nonempty set, and let <B(A, IR)
be the set of all bounded functionsf: A ~ IR. That is, f E <B(A, IR) if and only if
f E IRA and range f c [-b, b] for some b E IR. This is the same as saying that
range If I c [0, b], and we call any such b a bound of If I· The set <B(A, IR) is a

123

vector space V, since if If I and Igl are bounded by band c, respectively, then
Ixf ygl is bounded by Ixlb
lyle. The uniform norm Ilfll., is defined as the
smallest bound of If I· That is,

+

+

Ilfll., = lub {If(p)1 : pEA}.
Of course, it has to be checked that II II., is a norm. For any p in A,

If(p)

+ g(p)1

:::; If(p) I

+

+ Ig(p)1

:::; Ilfll",

+ Ilgll.,·

Thus Ilfll.,
Ilgll., is a bound of If gl and is therefore greater than or equal to
the smallest such bound, which is Ilf glloo. This gives the triangle inequality.
Next we note that if x ~ 0, then b bounds If I if and only if Ixlb bounds Ixfl, and
it follows that Ilxfll., = Ixillfll.,. Finally, Ilfll., ~ 0, and Ilfll., =
only if f is
the zero function.
We can replace IR by any normed linear space W in the above discussion.
A function f: A ---t W is bounded by b if and only if Ilf(p) II :::; b for all p in A,
and we define the corresponding uniform norm on CB(A, W) by

+

°

Ilflloo = lub {lIf(p) II : pEA}.
If f E e([O, 1]), then we know that the continuous function f assumes the
least upper bound of its range as a value (that is, f "assumes its maximum value"),
so that then IIfll., is the maximum value of If I· In general, however, the definition
must be given in terms of lub.
~II is interpreted as the distance from a to ~, it is
natural to define the open ball of radius r about the center a as {~ : II a - ~ II < r}.
We designate this ball Br(a). Translation through (3 preserves distance,

Balls. Remembering that II a -

and therefore ~ E Br(a) if and only if ~ (3 E Br(a (3). That is, translation
through (3 carries Br(a) into Br(a (3): T(:I[Br(a)] = Br(a (3). Also, scalar
multiplication by c multiplies all distances by c, and it follows in a similar way
that cBr(a) = Bcr(ca).
Although Br(a) behaves like a ball, the actual set being defined is different
for different norms, and some of them "look unspherelike". The unit balls about
the origin in 1R2 for the three norms II 1111 II 112, and II II., are shown in Fig. 3.2.
A subset A of a nls V is bounded if it lies in some ball, say Br(a). Then it
also lies in a ball about the origin, namely Br+llall(O). This is simply the fact that
if II ~ - all < r, then II ~II < r
lIall, which we get from the triangle inequality
upon rewriting II~II as lIa - a)
all.
The radius of the largest ball about a vector {3 which does not touch a set A
is naturally called the distance from {3 to A. It is clearly glb {II ~ - {311 : ~ E A}
(see Fig. 3.3).

A point ex is an interior point of a set A if some ball about ex is included in A.
This is equivalent to saying that the distance from ex to the complement of A is
positive (supposing that A is not the whole of V), and should coincide with
the reader's intuitive notion of what an "inside" point should be. A subset A
of a normed linear space is said to be open if every point of A is an interior
point.
If our language is to be consistent, an open ball should be an open set. It is:
if ex E B r({3), then Ilex - (311 < r, and then Ba(ex) C B r({3), provided that 0 :;:; r "ex - {311, by virtue of the triangle inequality (see Fig. 3.4). The reader should
write down the detailed proof. He has to show that if ~ E Ba(ex), then ~ E Br({3).
Our intuitions about distances are quite trustworthy, but they should always be
checked by a computation. The reader probably can see by a mental argument
that the union of any collection of open sets is open. In particular, the union of
any collection of open balls is open (Fig. 3.5), and this is probably the most
intuitive way of visualizing an open set. (See Exercise 2.9.)

A subset C is said to be closed if its complement C' is open.
Our discussion above shows that a non empty set C is closed if and only if

The so-called closed ball of radius r about {3, B = H : ,,~ - {311 :;:; r}, is a closed
set. As Fig. 3.6 suggests, the proof is another application of the triangle inequality.

3. CONTINUITY

Let V and W be any two normed linear spaces. We shall designate both norms
by II II. This ambiguous usage does not cause confusion. It is like the ambiguous
use of "0" for the zero elements of all the vector spaces under consideration. If we
replace the absolute value sign I I by the general norm symbol II II in the
definition we gave earlier for the limit of a real-valued function of a real variable,
it becomes verbatim the corresponding definition of convergence in the general
setting. However, we shall repeat the definition and take the occasion to relax
the hypothesis on the domain of f. Accordingly, let A by any subset of V, and let
f be any mapping from A to W.
Definition. We say that f(~) approaches (3 as ~ approaches a, and write
as ~ ~ a, if for every E there is a 0 such that

f(~) ~ {3

~ E

A and 0

< II ~ - all <

0 => IlfW -

(311 <

E.

If a E A and f(~) ~ f(a) as ~ ~ a, then we say that f is continuous at a.
We can then drop the requirement that ~ ~ a and have the direct E,Ocharacterization of continuity: f is continuous at a if for every E there exists a 0
such that II ~ - all < 0 => IlfW - f(a) II < E. It is understood here that ~ is
universally quantified over the domain A of f. We say that f is continuous if f is
continuous at every point a in its domain. If the absolute value of a number is
replaced by the norm of a vector, the limit theorems that we sampled in Section 1
hold verbatim for normed linear spaces. We shall ask the reader to write out a
few of these transcriptions in the exercises.
There is a property stronger than continuity at a which is much simpler to
use when it is available. We say that f is Lipschitz continuous at a if there is a
constant c such that IIf(~) - f(a) II ::; cll ~ - all for all ~ sufficiently close to a.

3.3

CONTINUITY

127

That is, there are constants c and r such that

II t - all <

r => IIf(t) - f(a) II

::; cll t - all·

The point is that now we can take 8 simply as E/c (provided E is small enough so
that this makes 8 ::; r; otherwise we have to set 8 = min {E/C, r}). We say
that f is a Lipschitz function (on its domain A) if there is a constant c such that
Ilf(~) - f(7J) II ::; cllt - 7111 for all t,7J in A. For a linear map T: V ~ W the
Lipschitz inequality is more simply written as

~ E V; we just use the fact that now T(~) - T(7J) = T(t - 71) and set
t - 71. In this context it is conventional to call T a bounded linear mapping

for all
~ =

rather than a Lipschitz linear mapping, and any such c is called a bound of T.
We know from the beginning calculus that if f is a continuous real-valued
function on [a, b) (that is, if f E e([a, b))), then II: f(x) £lxl ::; m(b - a), where
m is the maximum value of If(x)l. But this is just the uniform norm of f, so that
the inequality can be rewritten as II: fl ::; (b - a) 111!100. This shows that if the
uniform norm is used on e([a, b)), then f 1---+ I: f is a bounded linear functional,
with bound b - a.
It should immediately be pointed out that this is not the same notion of
boundedness we discussed earlier. There we called a real-valued function
bounded if its range was a bounded subset of IR. The analogue here would be to
call a vector-valued function bounded if its range is norm bounded. But a
nonzero linear transformation cannot be bounded in this sense, because

II T(xa) II

=

IxIIIT(a)ll·

The present definition amounts to the boundedness in the earlier sense of the
quotient T(a)/iiall (on V - {O}). It turns out that for a linear map T, being
continuous and being Lipschitz are the same thing.
TheoreDl 3.1. Let T be a linear mapping from a normed linear space V to a

normed linear space W. Then the following conditions are equivalent:
1) T is continuous at one point;
2) T is continuous;
3) T is bounded.

Proof. (1) => (3). Suppose T is continuous at ao. Then, taking E = 1, there
exists 8such that lIa - aoll < 8=> IIT(a) - T(ao)1I < 1. Setting t = a - ao
and using the additivity of T, we have II til < 8=> II T( t) II < 1. Now for any
nonzero 71, t = 871/2117111 has norm 8/2. Therefore, IIT(t)1I < 1. But
IIT(t)11 = 8I1T(7J)11/2117J11, giving IIT(7J)1I < 2117111/8. Thus T is bounded by
C = '2/8.

lIa - {311· Similarly, II{311 - lIall ~ 1I{3 - all = lIa - {311. This pair of inequalities is equivalent to the lemma. 0

Other Lipschitz mappings will appear when we study mappings with continuous differentials. Roughly speaking, the Lipschitz property lies between
continuity and continuous differentiability, and it is frequently the condition
that we actually apply under the hypothesis of continuous differentiability.
The smallest bound of a bounded linear transformation T is called its norm.
That is,
IITII = lub {IIT(a)lI/l1all : a ~ O}.
For example, let T: e([a, b]) ---+ ~ be the Riemann integral, T(f) = I: f(x) dx.
We saw earlier that if we use the uniform norm IIfll", on e([a, b)), then T is
bounded by b - a: IT(f)1 ~ (b - a)lIfll",. On the other hand, there is no smaller
bound, because I: 1 = b - a = (b - a) II 111",· Thus IITII = b - a. Other
formulations of the above definition are useful. Since
IIT(a)lI/l1all

=

IIT(alllall)1I

by homogeneity, and since {3 = aillall has norm 1, we have
IITII = lub {IIT({3)1I : 1I{311 = 1}.

Finally, if II"YII ~ 1, then"Y

IxIIlF({3)1I ~ IIF({3) II·

We therefore have an inefficient but still useful characterization:
IITII = lub {IIT("Y)II : II"YII ~ 1}.

These last two formulations are uniform norms. Thus, if B I is the closed unit
ball H : II ~II ~ 1}, we see that a linear T is bounded if and only if T fBI is

If V and Ware normed linear spaces, then Hom(V, W) is defined to be the
set of all bounded linear maps T: V ~ W. The results of Section 2.3 all remain

then any continuom, map from V to Tr takes bounded closed sets into bounded closed

Theorem. Let F be a mapping from an open subset A of a finite-dimensional
normed linear space V to a finite-dimensional normed linear space W. Suppose
that there is a T in Hom(V, lV) such that T-I exists and such that F - T is
Lipschitz on A, with constant 112m, where m = liT-III. Then F is injective, its
range R = F[.I] is an open subset of 11', and its inverse F-I is Lipschitz continuous, with constant 2m.
4. EQUIVALENT NORMS

Two normed linear spaces V and Ware norm isomorphic if there is a bijection T
from V to W such that T E Hom(V, W) and T- I E Hom(W, V). That is, an
isomorphism is a linear isomorphism T such that both T and T- I are continuous
(bounded). As usual, we regard isomorphic spaces as being essentially the same.
For two different norms on the same space we are led to the following definition.
Definition. Two norms p and q on the same vector space V are equivalent
if there exist constants a and b such that p ~ aq and q ~ bp.

Then (l/b)q ~ P ~ aq and (l/a)p ~ q ~ bp, so that two norms are
equivalent if and only if either can be bracketed by two multiples of the other.
The above definition simply says that the identity map ~ ~ ~ from V to V,
considered as a map from the normed linear space -< V, p>- to the normed
linear space -< V, q>-, is bounded in both directions, and hence that these two
normed linear spaces are isomorphic.
If V is infinite-dimensional, two norms will in general not be equivalent.
For example, if V = e([O, 1]) and fn(t) = tn, then Ilfnlll = l/(n
1) and
Ilinlloo = 1. Therefore, there is no constant a such that lIilloo ~ aililil for all
f E e[O, 1], and the norms II 1100 and II III are not equivalent on V = era, b].
This is why the very notion of a normed linear space depends on the assumption
of a given norm.
However, we have the following theorem, which we shall prove in the next
chapter by more sophisticated methods than we are using at present.

+

Theorem 4.1. On a finite-dimensional vector space Vall norms are equiva-

lent.
We shall need this theorem and also the following consequence of it occasionally in the present chapter.
Theorem 4.2. If V and Ware finite-dimensional normed linear spaces, then

every linear mapping T from V to W is necessarily bounded.

3.4

EQUIVALENT NORMS

133

Proof. Because of the above theorem, it is sufficient to prove T bounded with
respect to some pair of norms. Let (J: IR n ~ V and cp: IR m~ W be any basis
isomorphisms, and let {tii} be the matrix of T = cp-l 0 To (J in Hom(lR n, IRm).
Then

where b = max Itiil. Now q(T/) = IIcp-I(T/) 1100 and p(~) = II(J-I(~)III are norms
on Wand V respectively,. by Lemma 2.1, and since
q(T(~)

=

liT(o-l~)lloo

::;

bll(J-I~III

=

bp(~),

we see that T is bounded by b with respect to the norms p and q on V and W. D
If we change to an equivalent norm, we are merely passing through an
isomorphism, and all continuous linear properties remain unchanged. For
example:
Theorem 4.3. The vector space Hom(V, W) remains the same if either the

domain norm or the range norm is replaced by an equivalent norm, and the
two induced norms on Hom(V, W) are equivalent.
Proof. The proof is left to the reader.

We now ask what kind of a norm we might want on the Cartesian product
V X W of two normed linear spaces. It is natural to try to choose the product
norm so that the fundamental mappings relating the product space to the two
factor spaces, the two projections 7ri and the two injections (Ji, should be continuous. It turns out that these requirements determine the product norm
uniquely to within equivalence. For if II < a, ~ >- II has these properties, then

I <a, 0>- + <0, ~>- II ::; II <a, 0>- II + II <0, ~>- II
::; kliiall + k211 ~II ::; k(llall + II ~II),
where k i is a bound of the injection (Ji and k is the larger of kl and k 2 . Also,
Iiall ::; cI11 <a, ~>- II and II~II ::; c211 <a, ~>- II, by the boundedness of the projections 7ri, and so Iiall + II~II ::; cll <a, ~>- II, where c = C1 + C2. Now Iiall +
I ~II is clearly a norm II I! 1 on V X W, and our argument above shows that
I! <a, ~ >- II will satisfy our requirements if and only if it is equivalent to II Ill.

However, we shall use only the 1-, 2-, oo-product norms in this book. *
The triangle inequality, the continuity of addition, and our requirements on
a product norm form a set of nearly equivalent conditions. In particular, we
make the following observation.
Lemma 4.1. If V is a normed linear space, then the operation of addition
is a bounded linear map from V X V to V.

Proof. The triangle inequality for the norm on V says exactly that addition is
bounded by 1 when the sum norm is used on V X V. 0
A normed linear space V is a (norm) direct sum EB~ Vi if the mapping
-< XI, ... , Xn '? 1---7 L~ Xi is a norm isomorphism from II~ Vi to V. That is, the
given norm on V must be equivalent to the product norm it acquires when it is
viewed as II~ Vi. If V is algebraically the direct sum EB~ Vi, we always have

by the triangle inequality for the norm on V, and the sum on the right is the onenorm for II~ Vi. Therefore, V will be the norm direct sum EB~ Vi if, conversely,
there is an n-tuple of constants {k i } such that Ilxill :-:::: kilixil for all x. This is
the same as saying that the projections Pi: X 1---7 Xi are all bounded. Thus,
Theorem 4.5. If V is a normed linear space and V is algebraically the direct
sum V = EB~ Vi, then V = EB~ Vi as normed linear spaces if and only if
the associated projections {Pi} are all bounded.

isometric surjection from the seminormed space V to the normed space V IN. An
isometry is a distance-preserving map.
5. INFINITESIMALS

The notion of an infinitesimal was abused in the early literature of the calculus,
its treatment generally amounting to logical nonsense, and the term fell into
such disrepute that many modern books avoid it completely. Nevertheless, it
is a very useful idea, and we shall base our development of the differential upon
the properties of two special classes of infinitesimals which we shall call "big oh"
and "little oh" (and designate 'e' and 'e', respectively).
Originally an infinitesimal was considered to be a number that "is infinitely
small but not zero". Of course, there is no such number. Later, an infinitesimal
was considered to be a variable that approaches zero as its limit. However, we
know that it is functions that have limits, and a variable can be considered to
have a limit only if it is somehow considered to be a function. We end up looking
at functions cp such that cp(t) ~ 0 as t ~ O. The definition of derivative involves
several such infinitesimals. If f'(x) exists and has the value a, then the fundamental difference quotient (J(x
t) - f(x)) It is the quotient of two infinitesimals, and, furthermore, (U(x
t) - f(x))lt) - a also approaches 0 as t ~ O.
This last function is not defined at 0, but we can get around this if we wish by
multiplying through by t, obtaining

+
+

(J(x

+

+ t)

- f(x)) - at

= cp(t),

wheref(x
t) - f(x) is the "change in!" infinitesimal, at is a linear infinitesimal,
and cp(t) is an infinitesimal that approaches Ofaster than t (i.e., cp(t)lt ~ 0 as t ~ 0).
If we divide the last equation by t again, we see that this property of the infin-

:t5

INFINITESIMALS

137

itesimal <p, that it converges to 0 faster than t as t -+ 0, is exactly equivalent to
the fact that the difference quotient of 1 converges to a. This makes it clear that
the study of derivatives is included in the study of the rate at which infinitesimals get small, and the usefulness of this paraphrase will shortly become clear.
Definition. A subset A of a normed linear space V is a neighborhood of a
point a if A includes some open ball about a. A deleted neighborhood of a is a

neighborhood of a minus the point a itself.
We define special sets of functions fJ, 0, and 0 as follows. It will be assumed
in these definitions that each function is from a neighborhood of 0 in a normed
linear space V to a normed linear space W.
1 E fJ if 1(0) = 0 and 1 is continuous at O. These functions are the infinitesimals.

°

1 E if 1(0) = 0 and 1 is Lipschitz continuous at o. That is, there exist
positive constants rand esuch that IIfW II ::; ell ~II on Br(O).

f

Eo if f(O) = 0 and Ilf(~) 11I11 ~II -+ 0 as ~ -+

o.

When the spaces V and Ware not understood, we specify them by writing
Cl(V, W), etc.
A simple set of functions from ~ to ~ makes the qualitative difference
hdween these classes apparent. The function f(x) = Ix1 1/2 is in fJ (~, ~) but not
ill 0, g(x) = x is in and therefore in fJ but not in 0, and hex) = x 2 is in all
three classes (Fig. 3.7).

°

g

f

Fig. 3.7

It is clear that fJ, 0, and 0 are unchanged when the norms on V and Ware
n·placed by equivalent norms.
Our previous notion of the sum of two functions does not apply to a pair
of functions f, g E fJ(V, W) because their domains may be different. However,
f I· g is defined on the intersection dom f n dom g, which is still a neighborhood
"I' o. Moreover, addition remains commutative and associative when extended
III this way. It is clear that then fJ(V, W) is almost a vector space.
The only
t rouble occurs in connection with the equation f + (-f) = 0; the domain of
f lin function on the left is dom f, whereas we naturally take 0 to be the zero
function on the whole of V.

138

3.5

THE DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS

* The way out of this difficulty is to identify two functions f and g in [f if
they are the same on some ball about O. We define f and g to be equivalent
(f '" g) if and only if there exists a neighborhood of 0 on whichf = g. We then
check (in our minds) that this is an equivalence relation and that we now do
have a vector space. Its elements are called germs of functions at o. Strictly
speaking, a germ is thus an equivalence class of functions, but in practice one
tends to think of germs in terms of their representing functions, only keeping in
mind that two functions are the same as germs when they agree on a neighborhood of 0.*
As one might guess from our introductory discussion, the algebraic properties of the three classes [f, e, and e are crucial for the differential calculus.
We gather them together in the following theorem.
Theorelll 5.1

c e(V, W) c [f(V, W), and each of the three classes is closed
under addition and multiplication by scalars.
If f E e(V, W), and if g E e(W, X), then g 0 f E e(V, X), where
dom g 0 f = rl[dom gJ.
If either f or g above is in e, then so is g 0 f.
If f E e(V, W) and g E [f(V, IR), then fg E e(V, W), and similarly if
f E [f and gEe.
In (4) if either for g is in e and the other is merely bounded on a neighborhood of 0, then fg E e(V, W).

1) e(V, W)

2)

3)
4)
5)

6) Hom(V, W)

c e(V, W).

-7) Hom(V, W) n e(V, W) = {O}.
Proof. Let £.(V, W) be the set of infinitesimals f such that Ilf(~)11 ~ EII~II on
some ball about O. Thenf E e if and only if f is in some £., and fEe if and only
if f is in every £.. Obviously, e C e c [f.

1) If Ilf(~)11 ~ all~11 on Bt(O) and Ilg(~)1I ~ bll~11 on Bu(O), then

Ilf(O

+ g(~)11

~ (a

+ b)II~11

on Br(O), where r = min {t, u}. Thus e is closed under addition. The
closure of e under addition follows similarly, or simply from the limit of a
sum being the sum of the limits.
2) If Ilfa)II ~ all~11 when II~II ~ t and Ilg(71)11 ~ bll7111 when 117111 ~ u, then

IlgUW)11 ~

3) Now suppose thatf E 0 in (2). Then, given E, we can take a
Ilg(j(~)

when I ~II ~ r. Thus g 0 f E
essentially the same.

when I ~II ~ min (8, r). The other result follows similarly, as also does (5).
6) A bounded linear transformation is in 0 by definition.
7) Suppose that f E Hom(V, W) n 0(V, W). Take any a ~ o. Given E,
choose r so that IlfW I ~ Ell ~II on Br(O). Then write a as a = x~, where
I ~II < r. (Find ~ and x.) Then

Ilf(a)1I =

Ilf(x~)11

Ilf(~)11 ~

Ixl· E·

Thus Ilf(a) I ~ Ellall for every positive E, and so
proving (7). D

II~II

= Ellall·

f(a) = O. Thus f = 0,

Remark. The additivity of fwas not used in this argument, only its homogeneity.
It follows therefore that there is no homogeneous function (of degree 1) in 0
except o.

Sometimes when more than one variable is present it is necessary to indicate
with respect to which variable a function is in 0 or 0. We then write ''f(~) = o(~)"
for ''I EO", where "O(~)" is used to designate an arbitrary element of o.
The following rather curious lemma will be useful later in our proof of the
differentiability of an implicitly defined function. It is understood that 71 = f(~),
where f is the function we are studying.
Lemma 5.1. If 71

= oW

+ 0( -< ~, 71 >-) and also 71 =

d(~),

then 71 =

O(~).

Proof. The hypotheses imply that there are numbers b, rl and p such that
117111 ::; bll~11 !(II~II 117111) if II~II ~ rl and II~II 117111 ::; p, and then that

p/2 if II ~II is smaller than some r2. If I ~II

all the conditions are met and 117111 ::; bll ~II
inequality 117111::; (2b + 1)1I~11, and so 71 = 0(0. D

We shall also need the following straightforward result.
Lemma 5.2. If f E O(V, X) and g E O(V, Y), then -<f, g>- E O(V, X X Y).

That is,

-<O(~), o(~)

6. THE DIFFERENTIAL

Before considering the notion of the differential, we shall review some geometric
material from the elementary calculus. We do this for motivation only; our subsequent theory is independent of the preliminary discussion.
In the elementary one-variable calculus the derivative f'(a) of a function f
at the point a has geometric meaning as the slope of the tangent line to the graph
of f at the point a. (Of course, according to our notion of a function, the graph
of f is f.) The tangent line thus has the (point-slope) equation y - f(a) =
f'(a)(x - a), and is the graph of the affine map x f--+ f'(a) (x - a)
f(a).
We ordinarily examine the nature of the curve f near the point < a, f(a) >by using new variables which are zero at this point. That is, we express everything in terms of s = y - f(a) and t = x-a. This change of variables is
simply the translation <x,y>- f--+ <t,s>- = <x-a,y-f(a)>- in the
Cartesian plane ~2 which brings the point of interest < a, f(a) >- to the origin.
If we picture the situation in a Euclidean plane, of which the next page is a satisfactory local model, then this translation in ~2 is represented by a choice of new
axes, the t- and s-axes, with origin at the point of tangency. Since y = f(x)

+

3.6

THE DIFFERENTIAL

+

141

if and only if 8 = f(a
t) - f(a), we see that the image of f under this translation is the function !!.fa defined by t.fo(t) = f(a
t) - f(a). (See Fig. 3.8.)
Of course, t.fa is simply our old friend the change in f brought about by changing
x from a to a
t.

Similarly, the equation y - f(a) = 1'(a)(x - a) becomes s = 1'(a)t, and
the tangent line accordingly translates to the line that is (the graph of) the
linear functional l: t f---+ .f'(a)t having the number 1'(a) as its skeleton (matrix).
Remember that from the point of view of the geometric configuration (curve and
tangent line) in the Euclidean plane, all that we are doing is choosing the natural
axis system, with origin at the point of tangency. Then the curve is (the graph
of) the function t.fa, and the tangent line is (the graph of) the linear map l.
Now it follows from the definition of 1'(a) that l can also be characterized as
Ihe linear function that approximates t.fa most closely. For, by definition,
t.fa(t) _ f'(a)

t

as

t-O,

and this is exactly the same as saying that
t.fa(t) - let) _ 0

t

or

t.fa - lEe.

But we know from the Be-theorem that the expression of the function t.fa as the
sum l e is unique. This unique linear approximation l is called the differential
of f at a and is designated dfa. Again, the differential of f at a is the linear function
I: IR f---+ IR that approximates the actual change in f, t.fa, in the sense that
tlJa - lEe; we saw above that if the derivative l' (a) exists, then the differential
of J at a exists and has f'(a) as its skeleton (1 X 1 matrix).
Similarly, if 1 is a function of two variables, then (the graph of) 1 is a surface
ill Cartesian 3-space 1R3 = 1R2 X IR, and the tangent plane to this surface at
-< a, b,l(a, b) >- has the equation z - l(a, b) = 11 Ca, b)(x - a) 12(a, b)(x - b),

- I(a, b)

and l(s, t) = s/t(a, b) + t/2(a, b), then 1l.1<a,b> is the change in I around a, b
and 1 is the linear functional on ~2 with matrix (skeleton) -</t(a, b), /2(a, b) >.
Moreover, it is a theorem of the standard calculus that if the partial derivatives
of I are continuous, then again 1 approximates 1l.1<a,b>, with error in e. Here
also 1is called the differential of I at -< a, b> and is designated dl<a,b> (Fig. 3.9).
The notation in the figure has been changed to show the value at t = -< tt, t2 >
of the differential dis of I at a = -< all a2> .

The following definition should now be clear. As above, the local function

Definition. Let V and W be normed linear spaces, and let A be a neighborhood of a in V. A mapping F: A - W is differentiable at a if there is a T
in Hom(V, W) such that ll.Faa) = T(~) + e(~).

The ee-theorem implies then that T is uniquely determined, for if also ll.Fa =
S
e, then T - SEe, and so T - S = 0 by (7) of the theorem. This uniquely
determined T is called the differential 01 F at a and is designated dFa' Thus

* Our preliminary discussion should make it clear that this definition of the
differential agrees with standard usage when the domain space is R". However,
in certain cases when the domain space is an infinite-dimensional function space,
dFa is called the first variation of F at a. This is due to the fact that although the
early writers on the calculus of variations saw its analogy with the differential
calculus, they did not realize that it was the same subject.*
We gather together in the next two theorems the familiar rules for differentiation. They follow immediately from the definition and the el9-theorem.
It will be convenient to use the notation !Da(V, W) for the set of all mappings
from neighborhoods of a in V to W that are differentiable at a.

4) If F is a constant function on V, then F is differentiable and dFa = O.
5) If F E Hom(V, W), then F is differentiable at every a E V and dFa = F.

Proof

+ 19 = e + = e by (1) and (6) of the el9-theorem.
It is clear that t:.(F + G)a = t:.Fa + i1Ga. Therefore, t:.(F + G)a =
(dFa + 0) + (dGa + 0) = (dF a + dGa) + 0 by (1) of the el9-theorem. Since
dFa + dGa E Hom(V, W), we have (2).
t:.(FG)a(~) = F(a + ~)G(a + ~) - F(a)G(a)

7. DIRECTIONAL DERIVATIVES; THE MEAN-VALUE THEOREM

Directional derivatives form the connecting link between differentials and the
derivatives of the elementary calculus, and, although they add one more concept
that has to be fitted into the scheme of things, the reader should find them
intuitively satisfying and technically useful.
A continuous function f from an interval I C ~ to a normed linear space W
can have a derivativef'(x) at a point x E I in exactly the sense of the elementary
calculus:
f'(x)

lim f(x

+ t)

- f(x) .
t
The range of such a function f is a curve or arc in W, and it is conventional to
call f itself a parametrized arc when we want to keep this geometric notion in
mind. We shall also call f'(x), if it exists, the tangent vector to the arc f at x.
This terminology fits our geometric intuition, as Fig. 3.10 suggests. For simplicity we have set x = 0 and f(x) = O. If f'(x) exists, we say that the parametrized arc f is smooth at x. We also say that f is smooth at a = f(x), but this
terminology is ambiguous if f is not injective (i.e., if the arc crosses itself). An
arc is smooth if it is smooth at every value of the parameter.
We naturally wonder about the relationship between the existence of the
tangent vector f'(x) and the differentiability of fat x. If dfx exists, then, being a
linear map on ~, it is simply multiplication "by" the fixed vector a that is its
skeleton, dfx(h) = h dfx(1) = ha, and we expect a to be the tangent vector,

f' (x).

We showed this and also the converse result for the ordinary calculus in
our preliminary discussion in Section 6. Actually, our argument was valid for
vector-valued functions, but we shall repeat it anyway.
When we think of a vector-valued function of a real variable as being an
arc, we often use Greek letters like' 'A' and' 1" for the function, as we do below.
This of course does not in any way change what is being proved, but is slightly
suggestive of a geometric interpretation.
Theorem 7.1. A parametrized arc 1': [a, b] -+ Vis differentiable at x E (a, b)
if and only if the tangent vector (derivative) a = 'Y'(x) exists, in which case
the tangent vector is the skeleton of the differential, d'Yx(h) = h'Y'(x) = ha.

Proof. If the parametrized arc 1': [a, b] -+ V is differentiable at x E (a, b), then
d'Yx(h) = hd'Yx(1) = ha, where a = d'Yx(1). Since Ll'Yx - d'Yx E tJ, this gives
IILl'Yx(h) - hall/lhl-+ 0, and so Ll'Yx(h)/h -+ a as h -+ 0. Thus a is the derivative
'Y'(x) in the ordinary sense. By reversing the above steps we see that the existence of 1" (x) implies the differentiability of I' at x. 0
N ow let F be a function from an open set A in a normed linear space V to a
normed linear space W. One way to study the behavior of F in the neighborhood
of a point a in A is to consider how it behaves on each straight line through a.
That is, we study F by temporarily restricting it to a one-dimensional domain.
The advantage gained in doing this is that the restricted F is then simply a
parametrized arc, and its differential is simply multiplication by its ordinary
derivative.
For any nonzero ~ E V the straight line through a in the direction ~ has the
parametric representation t ....... a
t~. The restriction of F to this line is the
parametrized arc 1': 'Y(t) = F(a
t~). Its tangent vector (derivative) at the
origin t = 0, if it exists, is called the derivative of F in the direction ~ at a, or the
derivative of F with respect to ~ at a, and is designated D~F(a). Clearly,

+
+

D ~ F()
a

=

· F(a
11m

+ t~)t

- F(a)

.

t---+o

Comparing this with our original definition of 1', we see that the tangent vector
'Y'(x) to a parametrized arc I' is the directional derivative Dl'Y(X) with respect
to the standard basis vector 1 in R
Strictly speaking, we are misusing the word "direction", because different
vectors can have the same direction. Thus, if 11 = c~ with c > 0, then 11 and ~
point in the same direction, but, because DI;F(a) is linear in ~ (as we shall see in a
moment), their associated derivatives are different: D~F(a) = cDI;F(a).
We now want to establish the relationship between directional derivatives,
which are vectors, and differentials, which are linear maps. We saw above that
for an arc I' differentiability is equivalent to the existence of 'Y'(x) = Dl'Y(X).
In the general case the relationship is not as simple as it is for arcs, but in one
direction everything goes smoothly.

148

3.7

THE DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS

Theorelll 7.2. If F is differentiable at lX, and if Ais any smooth arc through lX,
with lX = A(X), then I' = F 0 A is smooth at x, and I"(x) = dFa(A'(X»).
In particular, if F is differentiable at lX, then every directional derivative
D~F(lX) exists, and D~F(lX) = dFaW.

Proof. The smoothness of I' is equivalent to its differentiability at x and therefore follows from the composite-function theorem. Moreover, I"(x) = dl'x(1) =
d(F 0 A)x(1) = dFa(dAA1») = dFa(A'(X»).
If A is the parametrized line
A(t) = lX
t~, then it has the constant derivative ~, and since lX = A(O) here,
the above formula becomes 1"(0) = dFaW.
That is, D~F(lX) = 1"(0) =
dFaW. 0

+

It is not true, conversely, that the existence of all the directional derivatives
of a function F at a point lX implies the differentiability of Fat lX. The
easiest counterexample involves the notion of a homogenous function. We say
that a function F: V -7 W is homogeneous if F(x~) = xF(~) for all x and ~.
For such a function the directional derivative D~F(O) exists because the arc
I'(t) = F(O
to = tFW is linear, and 1"(0) = F(~). Thus, all of the directional
derivatives of a homogeneous function F exist at 0 and D~F(O) = F(~). If F is
also differentiable at 0, then dFo(~) = D~F(O) = FW and F = dF o. Thus a
differentiable homogeneous function must be linear. Therefore, any nonlinear
homogeneous function F will be a function such that D~F(O) exists for all ~ but
dF o does not exist. Taking the simplest possible situation, define F: 1R2 - 7 IR by
F(x, y) = X3 /(X 2 y2) if <x, y> ~ <0,0> and F(O, 0) = O. Then
D~F(lX)

+

+

F(tx, ty)

=

tF(x, y),

so that F is homogeneous, but F is not linear.
However, if V is finite-dimensional, and if for each ~ in a spanning set of
vectors the directional derivative D~F(lX) exists and is a continuous function of lX
on an open set A, then F is continuously differentiable on A. The proof of this
fact depends on the mean-value theorem, which we take up next, but we shall
not complete it until Section 9 (Theorem 9.3).
The reader will remember the mean-value theorem as a cornerstone of the
calculus, and this is just as true in our general theory. We shall apply it in the
next section to give the proof of the general form of the above-mentioned
theorem, and practically all of our more advanced work will depend on it. The
ordinary mean-value theorem does not have an exact analogue here. Instead we
shall prove a theorem that in the one-variable calculus is an easy consequence of
the mean-value theorem.

The following more general version of the mean-value theorem is the form in
which it is ordinarily applied. As usual, F and G are from a subset of V to W.
Theorem 7.4. If F is differentiable in the ball BT(a), and if IIdFj311 ~ e for
every fJ in this ball, then 116Fj3(~)11 ~ ell ~II whenever fJ and fJ

Proof. The segment from fJ to fJ
~ is the range of the parametrized arc
X(t) = fJ
t~ from [0, 1] to V. If fJ and fJ
~ are in the ball BT(a), then this
segment is a subset of the ball. Setting 'Y(t) = F(fJ
t~), we then have 'Y'(x) =
dFj3+xE(},,'(x») = dFi3+x~(~), from Theorem 7.2. Therefore, II'Y'(x)II ~ ell~II on

that it includes the line segment joining any two of its points. This is the
definition of convexity, and the theorem is therefore true for any convex set. 0

We end this section with a few words about notation. Notice the reversal
of the positions of the variables in the identity (D~)(a) = dFa(~). This differl!IlCe has practical importance. We have a function of the two variables' a'
lI.nd ' which we can convert to a function of one variable by holding the other
variable fixed; it is convenient technically to put the fixed variable in subscript

e

..

150

THE DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS

position. Thus we think of dFa(~) with a held fixed and have the function dFa
in Hom(V, W), whereas in (D~F)(a) we hold ~ fixed and have the directional
derivative D~F: A ---t W in the fixed direction ~ as a function of a, generalizing
the notation for any ordinary partial derivative aF jaxi(a) as a function of a.
We can also express this implication of the subscript position of a variable in the
dot notation (Section 0.10): when we write D~F(a), we are thinking of the value
at a of the function D~F(·).
Still a third notation that we shall use in later chapters puts the function
symbol in subscript position. We write
J F(a)

=

dF a •

This notation implies that the mapping F is going to be fixed through a discussion
and gets it "out of the way" by putting it in subscript position.
If F is differentiable at each point of the open set A, then we naturally consider dF to be the map a ~ dF a from A to Hom(V, W). In the "J"-notation,
dF = J F. Later in this chapter we are going to consider the differentiability
of this map at a. This notion of the second differential d 2F a = d(dF)a is probably
confusing at first sight, and a preliminary look at it now may ease the later
discussion. We simply have a new map G = dF from an open set A in a normed
linear space V to a normed linear space X = Hom(V, W), and we consider its
differentiability at a. If dGa = d(dF)a exists, it is a linear map from V to
Hom(V, W), and there is something special now. Referring back to Theorem 6.1
of Chapter 1, we know that dGa = d 2 F a is equivalent by duality to a bilinear
mapping w from V X V to W: since dGa(~) is itself a transformation in
Hom(V, W), we can evaluate it at TI, and we define w by

The dot notation may be helpful here. The mapping a ~ dFa is simply
dF(.), and we have defined G by GO = dF(.). Later, the fact that dGaW is a
mapping can be emphasized by writing it as dGaa)(·). In each case here we
have a function of one variable, and the dot only reminds us of that fact and
shows us where we shall put the variable when indicating an evaluation. In the
case of w we have the original use of the dot, as in w(~, .) = dGa(~).

8. THE DIFFERENTIAL AND PRODUCT SPACES

In this section we shall relate the differentiation rules to the special configurationH
resulting from the expression of a vector space as a finite Cartesian product.
When dealing with the range, this is a trivial consideration, but when the domain
is a product space, we become involved with a deeper theorem. These general
product considerations will be specialized to the IRn-spaces in the next section,
but they also have a more general usefulness, as we shall see in the later sectionH
of this chapter and in later chapters.
We know that an m-tuple of functions on a common domain, Fi: A ~ Wi,
i = 1, ... , m, is equivalent to a single m-tuple-valued function
m

F: A ~ W

=

II Wi,

F(OI) being the m-tuple {F i (OI)}T for each a E A. We now check the obviously
necessary fact that F is differentiable at a if and only if each Fi is differentiable

at

01.

1, ... , m, and F = -< FI, ... ,Fm >-,
then F is differentiable at a if and only if all the functions Fi are, in which
case dF", = -< dF!, ... , dF':: >-.

TheoreDl 8.1. Given Fi: A ~ Wi, i =

Proof. Strictly speaking, F = LT 8i 0 F i , where 8j is the injection of W j into
the product space W = lIT Wi (see Section 1.3). Since each 8i is linear and
hence differentiable, with d(8 i )", = 8i, we see that if each Fi is differentiable at 01,
then so is F, and dF", = LT 8i 0 dF~. Less exactly, this is the statement
dF", = -<dF!, ... , dF'::>-. The converse follows similarly from Fi = 7ri 0 F,
where 7rj is the projection of lIT Wi onto Wj. D
Theorems 7.1 and 8.1 have the following obvious corollary (which can also
be proved as easily by a direct inspection of the limits involved) ..
LeDlDla 8.1. If f; is an arc from [a, b] to Wi, for i = 1, ... , n, and if f i~
the n-tuple-valued arc f = -<iI,.·., fn >-, then f'(x) exists if and only if
fI (x) exists for each i, in which case f'(x) = -<f~ (x), ... ,f~(x) >-.

When the domain space V is a product space lI~ V j the situation is morl'
complicated. A function F(h, ... , ~n) of n vector variables does not decomposl'

a.s

153

THE DIFFERENTIAL AND PRODUCT SPACES

into an equivalent n-tuple of functions. Moreover, although its differential
liFo. does decompose into an equivalent n-tuple of partial differentials {dF~},
we do not have the simple theorem that dFa. exists if and only if the partial
differentials dF~ all exist.
Of course, we regard a function F(h, ... , ~n) of n vector variables as being
a function of the single n-tuple variable ~ = < h, ... , ~n >-, so that in principle
t.here is nothing new when we consider the differentiability of F. However, when
we consider a composition FoG, the inner function G must now be an n-tuplevalued function G = <gl, ... , gn >-, where gi is from an open subset A of some
normed linear space X to Vi, and we naturally try to express the differential
of FoG in terms of the differentials dgi. To accomplish this we need the partial
differentials dF~ of F. For the moment we shall define the jth partial differential
of F at a = < ai, ... , a n >- as the restriction of the differential dF a. to Vj,
(~onsidered as a subspace of V =
Vi. As usual, this really involves the
injection OJ of Vj into II? Vi, and our formal (temporary) definition, accordingly,

luke this direct characterization as our definition of dF~, after which our moti\'lLting calculation above is the proof of the following lemma.

F: A - 7 W is differentiable at a, then all the partial differentials dF~ exist

THE DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS

The question then occurs as to whether the existence of all the partial
differentials dF~ implies the existence of dF a.. The answer in general is negative,
as we shall see in the next section, but if all the partial differentials dF~ exist for
each a in an open set A and are continuous functions of a, then F is continuously
differentiable on A. Note that Lemma 8.2 and the projection-injection identities
show us what dFa. must be if it exists: dF~ = dFa. 0 8 i and L 8i 0 'Tri = I together
imply that dFa. = L dF~ 0 'Tri.
Theorem 8.2. Let A be an open subset of the normed linear space
V = VI X V 2, and suppose that F: A ~ W has continuous partial differentials dF~a.f3> and dF~a.f3> on A. Then dF <a.f3> exists and is continuous
on A, and dF <a.f3>(~, 7]) = dF~a.f3>(~) + dF~a.f3>(7]).
Proof. We shall use the sum norm on V = VI X V 2. Given E, we choose aso
that I/dFi<J.'.v> - dF i<a.f3> I < E for every <'J.t, v>- in the a-ball about <'a, {3>and for i = 1, 2. Setting

to add dF! to this sum partial differential, concluding that L ~ dF~ 0 7r i is the
partial differential of F on the factor space VI X V 2 X V 3, and so on (which is
colloquial for induction). 0
As an illustration of the use of these two theorems, we shall deduce the
general product rule (although a direct proof based on .1-estimates is perfectly
feasible). A general product is simply a bounded bilinear mapping w: X X Y ---t W,
where X, Y, and Ware all normed linear spaces. The boundedness inequality
here is "w(~, 7/)11 ~ bll ~11117/11.

9. THE DIFFERENTIAL AND IRn

We shall now apply the results of the last two sections to mappings involving the
Cartesian spaces IR n , the bread and butter spaces of finite-dimensional theory.
We start with the domain.
Theorem 9.1. If F is a mapping from (an open subset of) IRn to a normed
linear space W, then the directional derivative of F in the direction of the .ith
standard basis vector ~j is just the partial derivative aF/ ax;, and the .ith
partial differential is multiplication by aF /aXj: dF~(h) = h(aF /aXj) (a).
More exactly, if anyone of the above three objects exists at a, then they
all do, with the above relationships.

Moreover, since the restriction of F to a + lR~j is a parametrized arc whose
differential at 0 is by definition the jth partial differential of F at a and whose
tangent vector at 0 we have just computed to be (aFjaxj)(a), the remainder of
the theorem follows from Theorem 7.1. 0
Combining this theorem and Theorem 7.2, we obtain the following result.
Theorelll 9.2. If V = IRn and F is differentiable at a, then the partial
derivatives (aF jaXj) (a) all exist and the n-tuple of partial derivatives at
a, {(aFjaxj)(a))~, is the skeleton of dF a. In particular,

All that we have done here is to display dF a as the linear combination mapping
defined by its skeleton {dFa(~i)} (see Theorem 1.2 of Chapter 1), where T(~i) =
tlFa(~i) is now recognized as the partial derivative (aFjaXi)(a). 0
The above formula shows the barbarism of the classical notation for partial
Ilcrivatives: note how it comes out if we try to evaluate dFa(x). The notation
[)aiF is precise but cumbersome. Other notations are F j and DjF. Each has its
problems, but the second probably minimizes the difficulties. Using it, our
formula reads dFa(Y) = L:J=1 yjDjF(a).
In the opposite direction we have the corresponding specialization of
Theorem 8.3.
Theorelll 9.3. If A is an open subset of IRn, and if F is a mapping from A

to a normed linear space W such that all of the \ partial derivatives
(aF jaXj) (a) exist and are continuous on A, then F is continuously differentiable on A.
Proof. Since the jth partial differential of F is simply multiplication by aF j aXil
we are (by Theorem 9.1) assuming the existence and continuity of all the partial
differentials dF~ on A. Theorem 9.3 thus becomes a special case of Theorem 8.3. 0

N ow suppose that the range space of F is also a Cartesian space, so that F
is a mapping from an open subset A of IR n to IRm. Then dF a is in Hom(lR n, IRm).

THE DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS

For computational purposes we want to represent linear maps from IRn to IR'"
by their matrices, and it is therefore of the utmost importance to find the matrix
t of the differential T = dF a' This matrix is called the Jacobian matrix of F
at a.
The columns of t form the skeleton of dF a, and we saw above that this
skeleton is the n-tuple of partial derivatives (aF /aXj) (a). If we write the mtuple-valued F loosely as an m-tuple of functions, F = -<!11""!m >-, then
according to Lemma 8.1, the jth column of t is the m-tuple

aF

Thus,

F be a mapping from an open subset of IR n to IRm, and
suppose that F is differentiable at a. Then the matrix of dFa (the Jacobian
matrix of F at a) is given by

This is the usual form of the chain rule in the calculus. We see that it is merely
the expression of the composition of linear maps as matrix multiplication.
We saw in Section 8 that the ordinary derivativef'(a) of a function! of one
real variable is the skeleton of the differential d!a, and it is perfectly reasonable to
generalize this relationship and define the derivative F'(a) of a function F of
n real variables to be the skeleton of dFa , so that F'(a) is the n-tuple of partial
derivatives {(aF /aXi) (a)H, as we saw above. In particular, if F is from an open
subset of IR n to IR m, then F'(a) is the Jacobian matrix of F at a. This gives the

is the linear map approximating flFa. and the derivative F'(a) must be the
matrix of this linear map when the domain and range spaces are Cartesian.
However, we shall stay with the language of Jacobians.
Suppose now that A is an open subset of a finite-dimensional vector space V
and that H: A ~ W is differentiable at a E A. Suppose that W is also finitedimensional and that cp: V ~ IR n and 1/;: W ~ IRm are any coordinate isomorphisms. If A = cp[A], then A is an open subset of IRn and H = 1/; 0 H 0 cp-l is a
mapping from A to IR m which is differentiable at a = cp(a), with dY. =
1/; 0 dHa. 0 cp-l. Then dH. is given by its Jacobian matrix {(ohi/oXj) (a)} , which
we now call the Jacobian matrix of H with respect to the chosen bases in V and
W. Change of bases in V and W changes the Jacobian matrix according to the
rule given in Section 2.4.
If F is a mapping from IR n to itself, then the determinant of the Jacobian
matrix COr;oXj)(a) is called the Jacobian of Fat a. It is designated
or
if it is understood that Yi = rex). Another notation is J F(a) (or simply J(a) if
F is understood). However, this is sometimes used to indicate the differential
dF., and we shall write det J F(a) instead.

ELEMENTARY APPLICATIONS

10. ELEMENTARY APPLICATIONS

The elementary max-min theory from the standard calculus generalizes with
little change, and we include a brief discussion of it at this point.
TheoreDl 10.1. Let F be a real-valued function defined on an open subset A
of a normed linear space V, and suppose that F assumes a relative maximum
value at a point a in A where dFa exists. Then dF a = O.

Proof. By definition D~F(a) is the derivative 'Y'(O) of the function 'Y(t) =
F(a
t~), and the domain of'Y is a neighborhood of 0 in R Since'Y has a relative
maximum value at 0, we have 'Y'(O) = 0 by the elementary calculus. Thus
dFa(~) = D~F(a) = 0 for all ~, and so dF a = O. 0

+

A point a such that dFa = 0 is called a critical point. The theorem states
that a differentiable real-valued function can have an interior extremal value
only at a critical point.
If V is IRn, then the above argument shows that a real-valued function F
can have a relative maximum (or minimum) at a only if the partial derivatives
(aF/aXi)(a) are all zero, and, as in the elementary calculus, this often provides
a way of calculating maximum (or minimum) values. Suppose, for example,
that we want to show that the cube is the most efficient rectangular parallelepiped
from the point of view of minimizing surface area for a given volume V. If
the edges are x, y and z, we have V = xyz and A = 2(xy + xz + yz) =
2(xy + V/y + V/x). Then from 0 = aAjax = 2(y - V/x 2), we see that
V = yx 2, and, similarly, aA/ay = 0 implies that V = xy2. Therefore, yx 2 =
xy2, and since neither x nor y can be 0, it follows that x = y. Then V = yx 2 =
x 3 , and x = V I /3 = y. Finally, substituting in V = xyz shows that z = V I /3.
Our critical configuration is thus a cube, with minimum area A = 6V 2 /3.
It was assumed above that A has an absolute minimum at some point
-< x, y, z >-. The reader might enjoy showing that A ~ 00 if any of x, y, z tends
to 0 or 00, which implies that the minimum does indeed exist.
We shall return to the problem of determining critical points in Sections
12, 15, and 16.
The condition dFa = 0 is necessary but not sufficient for an interior maximum or mmimum. The reader will remember a sufficient condition from
beginning calculus: If f'(x) = 0 and f"(x) < 0 (>0), then x is a relative maximum (minimum) point for f. We shall prove the corresponding general theorem
in Section 16. There are more possibilities now; among them we have the
analogous sufficient condition that if dFa = 0 and d 2F a is negative (positive)
definite as a quadratic form on V, then a is a relative maximum (minimum)
point of F.
We consider next the notion of a tangent plane to a graph. The calculation
of tangent lines to curves and tangent planes to surfaces is ordinarily considered
a geometric application of the derivative, and we take this as sufficient justification for considering the general question here.

162

3.10

THE DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS

Let F be a mapping from an open subset A of a normed linear space V to
a normed linear space W. When we view F as a graph in V X W, we think of it
as a "surface" S lying "over" the domain A, generalizing the geometric interpretation of the graph of a real-valued function of two real variables in 1R3 = 1R2 X IR.
The projection 11'1: V X W ~ V projects S "down" onto A,

-< ~, F(~) >- t;rt

~,

and the mapping ~ 1---+ -<~, F(~) >- gives the point of S lying "over"~. Our
geometric imagery views V as the plane (subspace) V X {O} in V X W, just as
we customarily visualize IR as the real axis IR X {O} in 1R2.
We now assume that F is differentiable at a. Our preliminary discussion in
Section 6 suggested that (the graph of) the linear function dF a is the tangent
plane to (the graph of) the function IlFa in V X W, and that its translate M
through -< a, F(a) >- is the tangent plane at -< a, F(a) >- to the surface S that is
(the graph of) F. The equation of this plane is TJ - F(a) = dFa(~ - a), and
it is accordingly (the graph of) the affine function GW = dFa(~ - a)
F(a).
Now we know that dFa is the unique T in Hom(V, W) such that IlFa(!;) =
T(r)
('J(r), and if we set r = ~ - a, it is easy to see that this is the same as
saying that G is the unique affine map from V to W such that

+

+

F(~)

G(~) =

-

('J(~

- a).

That is, M is the unique plane over V that "fits" the surface S around -< a, F(a) >in the sense of ('J-approximation.
However, there is one further geometric fact that greatly strengthens our
feeling that this really is the tangent plane.
Theorem 10.2. The plane with equation TJ - F(a) = dFa(~ - a) is
exactly the union of all the straight lines through -< a, F(a) >- in V X W
that are tangent to smooth curves on the surface S = graph F passing
through this point. In other words, the vectors in the subspace dFa of
V X Ware exactly the tangent vectors to curves lying in S and passing
through -< a, F(a) >-.
-<~, TJ

t~ in V has -<~, dFaa) >- = -<~, TJ >- as its
tangent vector at -< a, F(a) >-, by Lemma 8.1 and Theorem 8.2.
Conversely, if t 1---+ -< X(t), F (X(t») >- is any smooth arc in S passing through a,
with a = X(to), then its tangent vector at -< a, F(a) >- is

-< X' (to), dFa (X' (to») >- ,
a vector in (the graph of) dFa. 0

ll. THE IMPLICIT-FUNCTION THEOREM

The formula for the Jacobian of a composite map that we obtained in Section \)
is reminiscent of the chain rule for the differential of a composite map that we
derived earlier (Section 8). The Jacobian formula involves numbers (partial
derivatives) that we multiply and add; the differential chain rule involves linear
maps (partial differentials) that we compose and add. (The similarity becomes
a full formal analogy if we use block decompositions.) Roughly speaking, the

3.11

THE IMPLICIT-FUNCTW:>i THEOREM

whole differential calculus goes this way. In the one-variable calculus a differential is a linear map from the one-dimensional space IR to itself, and is therefore
multiplication by a number, the derivative. In the many-variable calculus when
we decompose with respect to one-dimensional subspaces, we get blocks of such
numbers, i.e., Jacobian matrices. When we generalize the whole theory to vector
spaces that are not one-dimensional, we get essentially the same formulas but
with numbers replaced by linear maps (differentials) and multiplication by
composition.
Thus the derivative of an inverse function is the reciprocal of the derivative
1 and b = f(a), then g'(b) = l/f'(a). The differential
of the function: if 9 =
of an inverse map is the composition inverse of the differential of the map: if
G = F- 1 and F(a) = {3, then dG{3 = (dFa)-l.
If the equation g(x, y) =

We shall see below that if G(~, 7)) = defines 7) as a function of ~, 7) = F(~),
and if (3 = F(a), then we calculate the differential dF a by differentiating the
identity G(~, F(~)) = 0, and we get a formula formally identical to the above.
Finally, in exactly the same way, the so-called auxiliary variable method of
solving max-min problems in the elementary calculus has the same formal
structure as our later solution of a "constrained" maximum problem by Lagrange
multipliers.
In this section we shall consider the existence and differentiability of functions implicitly defined. Suppose that we are given a (vector-valued) function
G(~, 7)) of two vector variables, and we want to know whether setting G equal
to defines 7) as a function of ~, that is, whether there exists a unique function F
such that G (~, F(~)) is identically zero. Supposing that such an "implicitly
defined" function F exists and that everything is differentiable, we can try
to compute the differential of F at a by differentiating the equation G(~, F(~)) =
0, or Go <.1, F'? = 0. We get dG~a,B> 0 dl a
dG~a,{3> 0 dF a = 0, where we

so is elF a, and the above calculation therefore strongly suggests that we are

THE DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS

going to need the existence of (dG~a,tJ»-1 as a necessary condition for the
existence of a uniquely defined implicit function around the point -< a, (3 > .
Since (3 is F(a), we also need G(a,
= O. These considerations will lead us to
the right theorem, but we shall have to postpone part of its proof to the next
chapter. What we can prove here is that if there is an implicitly defined function,
then it must be differentiable.

Theorem 11.1. Let V, W, and X be normed linear spaces, and let G be a
mapping from an open subset A X B of V X W to X. Suppose that F is a continuous mapping from A to B implicitly defined by the equation G(~, 1/) = 0,
that is, satisfying G(~, F(~)) = 0 on A. Finally, suppose that G is differentiable at -< a, (3 >, where (3 = F(a), and that dG~a,tJ> is invertible. Then
F is differentiable at a and dFa = -(dG~a,tJ»-1 0 dG~a,tJ>.

=

1/ = _T-l(dG~a,tJ>(~))

dG~a,tJ>' and solving for 1/, we get

+ O(e( -<~, 1/> )).

+

This equation is of the form 1/ = O(~)
e( -< ~, 1/ > ), and since 1/ = dF a(~) is
an infinitesimal 9'(~), by the continuity of F at a, Lemmas 5.1 and 5.2 imply
first that 1/ = O(~) and then that -<~, 1/> = O(~). Thus O(e(-<~, 1/») =
e(eO(m) = ea), and we have

+ e(~),

where 8 = -(dG~a,tJ»-1 0 dG~a,tJ>' an element of Hom(V, W). Therefore, F
is differentiable at a and dF a has the asserted value. 0
We shall show in the next chapter, as an application of the fixed-point
theorem, that if V, W, and X are finite-dimensional, and if G is a continuously
differentiable mapping from an open subset A X B of V X W to X such that
at the point -<a, (3) we have both G(a, (3) = 0 and dG~a,tJ> invertible, then
there is a uniquely determined continuous mapping F from a neighborhood M of
a to B such that F(a) = (3 and G(~, F(~)) = 0 on M. The same theorem is true
for the more general class of complete normed linear spaces which we shall study
in the next chapter. For these spaces it is also true that if T- l exists, then so
does 8-1 for all 8 sufficiently close to T, and the mapping 81--+8- 1 is continuous. Therefore dG~p.,.> is invertible for all -<fJ., v> sufficiently close to
-< a, (3 >, and the above theorem then implies that F is differentiable on a
neighborhood of a. Moreover, only continuous mappings are involved in the
formula given by the theorem for dF: fJ. 1--+ dFp., and it follows that F is in fact
continuously differentiable near a. These conclusions constitute the implicitfunction theorem, which we now restate.

If V and Ware finite-dimensional spaces, with dimensions nand m, respectively,
and if F is a continuous mapping from an open subset A of V to W, then (the
graph of) F is a subset of V X W which we visualize as a kind of "n-dimensional
surface" S spread out over A. (See Section 10.) We shall call F an n-dimensional
patch in V X W. :\Iore generally, if X is any (n
m)-dimensional vector space,
we shall call a subset S an n-dimensional patch if there is an isomorphism 'P
from X to a product space V X W such that V is n-dimensional and 'P[S] is a
patch in V X W. That is, S becomes a patch in the above sense when X is
considered to be V X W. This means that if 11"1 is the projection of X = V X W

+

r

onto V, then 1I"dS] is an open subset A of V, and the restriction 11"1 S is one-toone and has a continuous inverse. If 11"2 is the projection on W, then F =
11"2 a (11"1
S)-I~ is the map from A to W whose graph in V X W is S (when
V X W is identified with X).
N ow there are important surfaces that aren't such "patch" surfaces. Consider, for instance, the surface of the unit ball in ~3, S = {x : L~ x 2 = I}. S is
obviously a two-dimensional surface in ~3 which cannot be expressed as a graph,
no matter how we try to express ~3 as a direct sum. However, it should be
equally clear that S is the union of overlapping surface patches. If a is any point
on S, then any sufficiently small neighborhood N of a in ~3 will intersect S in a
patch; we take Vas the subspace parallel to the tangent plane at a and Was
the perpendicular line through O. Moreover, this property of S is a completely
adequate definition of what we mean by a submanifold.
A subset S of an (n + m)-dimensional vector space X is an n-dimensional
submanifold of X if each a on S has a neighborhood N in X whose intersection
with S is an n-dimensional patch.
We say that S is smooth if all these patches Sa are smooth, that is, if the
function F: A ---? W whose graph in V X W is the patch Sa (when X is viewed
as V X W) is continuously differentiable for every such patch Sa.
The sphere we considered above is a two-dimensional smooth submanifold
of ~3.
Submanifolds are frequently presented as zero sets of mappings. For
example, our sphere above is the zero set of the mapping G from ~3 to ~ defined
by G(x) = L~ xl - 1. It is obviously important to have a condition guaranteeing that such a null set is a submanifold.

r

Theorem 12.1. Let G be a continuously differentiable mapping from an open
subset U of an (n + m)-dimensional vector space X to an m-dimensional
vector space Y such that dGa is surjective for every a in the zero set S of G.
Then S is an n-dimensional submanifold of X.

Proof. Choose any point 'Y of S. Since dG-y is surjective from the (n + m)dimensional vector space X to the m-dimensional vector space Y, we know that
the null space V of dG-y has dimension n (Theorem 2.4, Chapter 2). Let W be any

3.12

SUBMANIFOLDS AND LAGRANGE MULTIPLIERS

173

complement of V, and think of X as V X W, so that G now becomes a function of
two vector variables and 'Y is a point <a, /3 >- such that G(a, /3) = O. The
restriction of dG <a.,fJ> to W is an isomorphism from W to Y; that is, (dG~a.,fJ»-l
exists. Therefore, by the implicit-function theorem, there is a product neighborhood Sa(a) X Sr(/3) of < a, /3 >- in X whose intersection with S is the graph
of a function on Sa(a). This proves our theorem. 0
If S is a smooth submanifold, then the function F whose graph is the patch
of S around 'Y (when X is viewed suitably as V X W) is continuously differentiable, and therefore S has a uniquely determined n-dimensional tangent plane M
at 'Y that fits S most closely around 'Y in the sense of our l'J-approximations.
If 'Y = 0, this tangent plane is an n-dimensional subspace, and in general it is
the translate through 'Y of a subspace N. We call N t.he tangent space of S at 'Y;
its elements are exactly the vectors in X tangent to parametrized arcs drawn
in S through 'Y. What we are going to do later is to describe an n-dimensional
manifold S independently of any imbedding of S in a vector space. The tangent
space to S at a point 'Y will still be an invaluable notion, but we are not going to
he able to visualize it by an actual tangent plane in a space X carrying S.
Instead, we will have to construct the vector space tangent to S at 'Y somehow.
The clue is provided by Theorem 10.2, which tells us that if S is imbedded
I1S a submanifold in a vector space X, then each vector tangent to S at 'Y can be
presented as the unique tangent vector at 'Y to some smooth curve lying in S.
This mapping from the set of smooth curves in S through 'Y to the tangent space
Itt'Y is not injective; clearly, different curves can be tangent to each other at 'Y
ILlld so have the same tangent vector there. Therefore, the object in S that
eorresponds to a tangent vector at 'Y is an equivalence class of smooth curves
through 'Y, and this will in fact be our definition of a tangent vector for a general
lIIanifold.
The notion of a submanifold allows us to consider in an elegant way a
<:Iassical "constrained" maximum problem. Weare given an open subset U
of a finite-dimensional vector space X, a differentiable real-valued function F
defined on U, and a submanifold S lying in U. We shall suppose that the
,ubmanifold S is the zero set of a continuously differentiable mapping G from U
10 a vector space Y such that dG"( is surjective for each 'Y on S. We wish to
('lIllsider the problem of maximizing (or minimizing) F('Y) when 'Y is "conHtrained" to lie on S. We cannot expect to find such a maximum point 'Yo by
Hd,ting dF"( = 0 and solving for 'Y, because 'Yo will not be a critical point for F.
(:ollsider, for example, the function fI(x) = L~ xT - 1 from ~3 to ~ and F(x) =
.1'2' Here the "surface" defined by fI = 0 is the unit sphere L~ xT = 1, and on
Ihis sphere F has its maximum value 1 at <0,1,0>-. But F is linear, and so
,[/,,"( = F can never be the zero transformation. The device known as Lagrange
multipliers shows that we can nevertheless find such constrained critical points
by solving dL,,( = 0 for a suitable function L.

Proof. By the implicit-function theorem we can express X as V X W in such a
way that the neighborhood of S around I' is the graph of a mapping H from an
open set A in V to W. Thus, expressing F and G as functions on V X W, we
have G(~, 1/) = 0 near I' = «a, (3) if and only if 1/ = H(~), and the restriction
of F(~, 1/) to this zero surface is thus the function K: A ~ IR defined by Ka) =
F (~, H (~». By assumption a is a critical point for this function. Thus

Also from the identity G(~, H(O) = 0, we get

Since dG~a,fJ> is invertible, we can solve the second equation for dHa and
substitute in the first, thus getting, dropping the subscripts for simplicity,

Let l E y* be the functional dF 2 0 (dG 2 )-I. Then we have dF I = lo dG I and,
by definition, dF 2 = lo dG 2 • Composing the first equation (on the right) with
1rl: V X W ~ V and the second with 1r2, and adding, we get dF <a,p> =
lo dG<a,p>. That is, d(F - lo Gh = o. 0
Nothing we have said so far explains the phrase "Lagrange mUltipliers".
This comes out of the Cartesian expression of the theorem, where we have U
an open subset of a Cartesian space IR n, Y = IR m , G = « gl, ... , gm> , and l ill
y* of the form lc: l(y) = L'f CiYi. Then F - loG = F - L'f Cig i , and

Our original trivial example will show how this works out in practice. We
want to maximize F(x) = X2 from 1R3 to IR subject to the constraint L~ x'f = 1.
Here g(x) = L~ x'f - 1 is also from 1R3 to IR, and our method tells us to look
for a critical point of F - cg subject to g = O. Our system of equations is

The first says that c = or Xl = 0, and the second implies that c cannot be 0.
Therefore, Xl = Xa = 0, and the fourth equation then shows that X2 = ±1.

*13. FUNCTIONAL DEPENDENCE

The question, roughly, is this: If we are given a collection of continuous functions,
all defined on some open set A, how can we tell whether or not some of them are
functions of the rest? For example, if we are given three real-valued continuous
functions fll 12, and fa, how can we tell whether or not some one of them is a
function of the other two, say fa is a function offl and12, which means that there
is a function of two variables g(x, y) such that fa(t) = g(!I (t), f2(t)) for all t in
the common domain A? If this happens, we say that fa is functionally dependent
on !I and f2. This is very nearly the same as asking when it will be the case that
the range S of the mapping F: t ~ <'!I(t),!2(t), fa(t) >- is a two-dimensional
submanifold of IRa. However, there are differences in these questions that are
worth noting. If fa is functionally dependent on fl and f2' then the range of F
certainly lies on a two-dimensional submanifold of IRa, namely, the graph of g.
But this is no guarantee that it itself forms a two-dimensional submanifold.
For example, both 12 and fa might be functionally dependent on !I, f2 = go fl'
and fa = h 0!I, in which case the range of F lies on the curve <. s, g(s), h(s) >- in
IRa, which is a one-dimensional submanifold. In the opposite direction, the range
of F can be a two-dimensional submanifold M without fa being functionally
dependent onf2 and fl. All we can conclude in this case is that locally one of the
functions {h} ~ is a function of the other two, since locally M is a surface patch,
in the language of the last section. But if we move a little bit away on the
eurving surface M to the neighborhood of another point, we may have to solve
for a different one of the functions. Nevertheless, if M = range F is a subset of
u two-dimensional manifold, it is reasonable to say that the functions {h} ~ are
functionally dependent, and we are led to examine this more natural notion.

THE DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS

If we assume that F = -<ft, f2' fa >- is continuously differentiable and that
the rank of dF a is 3 at some point a in A, then the implicit-function theorem
implies that F[A] includes a whole ball in 1R3 about the point F(a). Thus a
necessary condition for !If = range F to lie on a two-dimensional submanifold in
1R3 is that the rank of dF a be everywhere less than 3. We shall see, in fact, that
if the rank of dFa is 2 for all a, then lIf = range F is essentially a two-dimensional
manifold. (There is still a tiny difficulty that we shall explain later.) Our tools
are going to be the implicit-function theorem and the following theorem, which
could well have come much earlier, that the rank of T is a "lower semi continuous" function of T.

V and W be finite-dimensional vector spaces, normed
in some way. Then for any Tin Hom(V, W) there is an E such that

Pl'oof. Let T have null space N and range R, and let X be any complement of
N in V. Then the restriction of T to X is an isomorphism to R, and hence is
bounded below by some positive m. (I ts inverse from R to X is bounded by
some b, by Theorem 4.2, and we set m = l/b.) Then if liS - Til < m/2, it
follows that S is bounded below on X by m/2, for the inequalities

together imply that IIS(a)11 ~ (m/2)llall. In particular, S is injective on X, and
so rank S = derange S) ~ d(X) = d(R) = rank T. D
We can now prove the general local theorem.
Theorelll 13.2. Let V and W be finite-dimensional spaces, let l' be an integer
less than the dimension of W, and let F be a continuously differentiable map
from an open subset A C V to W such that the rank of dF-y = r for all 'Y
in A. Then each point 'Y in A has a neighborhood U such that F[U] is an
r-dimensional patch submanifold of W.

Proof. For a fixed 'Y in A let VIand Y be the null space and range of dF-y, let
V 2 be a complement of VI in V, and view V as VI X V 2. Then F becomes
a function F(~, 71) of two variables, and if 'Y = -<a, f3>-, then dF~a,{J> is an
isomorphism from V 2 to Y. At this point we can already choose the decomposition W = WI Et> W 2 with respect to which F[A] is going to be a graph
(locally). We simply choose any direct sum decomposition W = WI Et> W 2
such that W 2 is a complement of Y = range dF <a,{J>' Thus WI might be Y,
but it doesn't have to be. Let P be the projection of W onto W b along W 2.
Since Y is a complement of the null space of P, we know that PlY is an
isomorphism from Y to WI. In particular, WI is r-dimensional, and

rank P

Moreover, and this is crucial, P is an isomorphism from the range of
dF <~,~> to WI for all <~, 71 >- sufficiently close to < a, (3 >-. For the above rank
theorem implies that rank po dF <~,~> ~ rank P 0 dF <a,~> = r on some
neighborhood of < a, (3 >-. On the other hand, the range of P 0 dF <~,~> is
included in the range of P, which is WI, and so rank P 0 dF <~,~> ~ r. Thus
rank po dF <~,'1> = r for <~, 71>- near <a, (3)-, and since rank dF <~,~> = r
by hypothesis, we see that P is an isomorphism on the range of any such dF <~,'1>'

If J1. = po F(a, (3), then dH~I',a,~> = P 0 dF~a,~>, which is an isomorphism from V 2 to WI. Therefore, by the implicit-function theorem there exists
a neighborhood L X M X N of <J1., a, (3 >- and a uniquely determined continuously differentiable mapping G from L X M to N such that

H(r, ~, G(r, ~») = 0
on L X M. That is,

r = P 0 F(~, G(r, ~»)
on L X M.
The remainder of our argument consists in showing that F (~, G(r, ~») is a
function of r alone. We start by differentiating the above equation with respect
to ~, getting
0= po (dFI+dF2odG2) = podFo <I,dG 2>-.
As noted above, P is an isomorphism on the range of dF <~,~> for all <~, 71 >sufficiently close to < a, (3 >- , and if we suppose that L X M is also taken small
enough so that this holds, then the above equation implies that

THE DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS

Since F1[U] = P 0 F[U] = L, the above equation says that F[U] is the graph of
the mapping k from L to W 2. Moreover, L is an open subset of the r-dimensional
vector space W 1, and therefore F[U] is an r-dimensional patch manifold in
W = W 1 X W 2• 0

The above theorem includes the answer to our original question about
functional dependence.
Corollary. Let F = {fi}i be an m-tuple of continuously differentiable
real-valued functions defined on an open subset A of a normed linear space
V, and suppose that the rank of dFa has the constant value r on A, where r
is less than m. Then any point 'Y in A has a neighborhood U over which
m - r of the functions are functionally dependent on the remaining r.
Proof. By hypothesis the range Y of dF'Y = -<df~, ... , df!7> is an r-dimensional subspace of IRm. We can therefore find a basis for a complementary subspace W 2 by choosing m - r of the standard basis elements {6 i }, and we may
as well renumber the functions so that these are 6 +1 , ••• ,6m • Then the
projection P of IR m onto W = L(6 1, ••• , 6T ) is an isomorphism from Y to W
(since Y is a complement of its null space), and by the theorem there is a neighborhood U of 'Y over which (l - P) 0 F is a function k of po F. But this says
exactly that -<r+1, ... ,r> = k 0 -<fl, ... ,r>. That is, k is an (m - r)tuple-valued function, k = -<kr+t, ... , k m >, and fi = ki 0 -<ft, ... ,F> for
j = r + 1, ... ,m. 0

We mentioned earlier in the section that there was a difficulty in concluding
that if F is a continuously differentiable map from an open subset A of V to W
whose differential has constant rank r less than deW), then S = range F is an
r-dimensional submanifold of S. The flaw can be described as follows. The
definition of a submanifold S of X required that each point of S have a neighborhood in X whose intersection with S is a patch. In the case before us, what we

3.14

179

can conclude is that if fl is a point of S, then fl = F(at.) for some at. in A, and at.
has a neighborhood U whose image under F is a patch. But this image may not
be a full neighborhood of fl in S, because S may curve back on itself in such a
way as to intrude into every neighborhood of fl. Consider, for example, the onedimensional r imbedded in 1R3 suggested by following Fig. 3.12. The curve
begins in the xz-plane along the z-axis, curves over, and when it comes to the
xy-plane it starts spiraling in to the origin in the xy-plane (the point of change
over from the xz-plane to the xy-plane is a singularity that we could smooth out).
The origin is not a point having a neighborhood in 1R3 whose intersection with r
is a one-patch, but the full curve is the image of (-1, 1) under a continuously
differentiable injection.
We would consider r to be a one-dimensional manifold without any difficulty,
but something has gone wrong with its imbedding in 1R 3 , so it is not a one-dimensional submanifold of 1R3.
*14. UNIFORM CONTINUITY AND FUNCTION-VALUED MAPPINGS

In the next chapter we shall see that a continuous function F whose domain is a
bounded closed subset of a finite-dimensional vector space V is necessarily
uniformly continuous. This means that given E, there is a ~ such that

The point is that 8 depends only on E and not, as in ordinary continuity,
on the "anchor" point at which continuity is being asserted. This is a very
important property. In this section we shall see that it underlies a class of
theorems in which a point map is escalated to a function-valued map, and properties of the point map imply corresponding properties of the function-valued
map. Such theorems have powerful applications, as we shall see in Section 15
and in Section 1 of Chapter 6. An application that we shall get immediately here
is the theorem on differentIation under the integral sign. However, it is only
Theorem 14.3 that will be used later in the book.
Suppose first that Fa, 'I) is a bounded continuous function from a product
open set M X N to a normed linear space X. Holding 'I fixed, we have a function
I.(E) = F(~, 'I) which is a bounded continuous function on M, that is, an
~Iement of the normed linear space Y = me(M, X) of all bounded continuous
maps from M to X. This function is also indicated F( . , 'I), so that f~ = F( . , 'I)'
We are supposing that the uniform norm is being used on Y:

We have proved that if a function of two variables is uniformly continuous,
then the mappings obtained from it by the general duality principle are continuous. This phenomenon lies behind many well-known facts. For example:
Corollary. If F(x, y) is a uniformly continuous real-valued function on the
unit square [0, 11 X [0, 11 in ~2, then
F(x, y) dx is a continuous function

of y.

F(x, y) dx is the composition of the bounded

We consider next the differentiability of the above duality-induced mapping.
Theorelll 14.2. If F is a bounded continuous mapping from an open product
set M X N of a normed linear space V X W to a normed linear space X,

This says exactly that the mapping cP is differentiable at (3 and dcp/l

T. 0

The mapping cP is in fact continuously differentiable, as can be seen by
arguing a little further in the above manner. The situation is very close to being
an application of Theorem 14.1.
The classical theorem on differentiability under the integral sign is a corollary
of the above theorem. We give a simple case. Note that if 71 is a real variable y,
then the above formula for dcp can be rewritten in terms of arc derivatives:
[cp'(b)]W

= ~~ (~, b).

Corollary. If F(x, y) is a continuous real-valued function on the unit
square [0, 1] X [0, 1], and if aF jay exists and is a uniformly continuous
function on the square, then U F(x, y) dx is a differentiable function of y
and its derivative is U (aFjay) (x, y) dx.

Proof. The mapping T: y f-+ U F(x, y) dx is the composition of the bounded
linear mappingf f-+ U f(x) dx from e([O, 1]) to IR with the differentiable mapping
cp: y f-+ F( . ,y) from [0, 1] to e([O, 1]), and is therefore differentiable by the
composite-function rule. Then Theorem 7.2 and the fact that the differential of
a bounded linear map is itself give
T'(y) =

[cp'(y)](x) dx =

We come now to the situation of most importance to us, where a point to
point map generates a function-to-function map by composition. Let A be an
open set in a normed linear space V, let S be an arbitrary set, and let a be the
set of bounded mapsf from S to A. Then a is a subset of the normed linear space
<B(S, V) of all bounded functions from S to V under the uniform norm. A function f E a will be an interior point of a if and only if the distance from the range
of f to the boundary of a is a positive number ~, for this is clearly equivalent to
saying that a includes a ball in <B(S, V) about the point f. Now let g be any
bounded mapping from A to a normed linear space W, and let G: a ~ <B(S, W)
be composition by g. That is, h = G(f) if and only if f E a and h = g 0 f. We
can consider both the continuity and differentiability of G, but we shall only
work out the differentiability theorem.
Theorem 14.3. Let the function g: A ~ W be differentiable at each point
a in A, and let dg(JI. be a bounded uniformly continuous function of a. Then
the mapping G: a ~ <B(S, W) defined by G(fl = go f is differentiable at

In the above situation, if g is from A X U to W, so that G(f) is the function
h given by h(t) = g(j(t), t), then nothing is changed except that the theorem is
about dg l instead of dg. If, in addition, V is a product space V 1 X V 2, so that f

*15. THE CALCULUS OF VARIATIONS

The problems of the calculus of variations are simply critical-point problems of a
certain type with a characteristic twist in the way the condition dF a = 0 is used.
We shall illustrate the subject by proving one of its standard theorems.
Since we want to solve a constrained maximum problem in which the domain
is an infinite-dimensional vector space, a systematic discussion would start off

3.15

with a more general form of the Lagrange multiplier theorem. However, for our
purpose it is sufficient to note that if S is a closed plane M
a, then the restriction of F to S is equivalent to a new function on the vector space 111, and its
differential at {3 = T/
a in S is clearly just the restriction of dFfJ to M. The
requirement that {3 be a critical point for the constrained function is therefore
simply the requirement that dFfJ vanish on M.
Let F be a uniformly continuous differentiable real-valued function of three
variables defined on (an open subset of) W X W X IR, where W is a normed
linear space. Given a closed interval [a, b] C IR, let V be the normed linear space
e1([a, b], W) of smooth arcs f: [a, b] ~ W, with Ilfll taken as Ilflloo
11!'1100.
The problem is to maximize the (nonlinear) functional G(f) =
F(j(t), !'(t), t) dt,
subject to the restraints f(a) = a and feb) = {3. That is, we consider only
smooth arcs in W with fixed endpoints a and {3, and we want to find that arc
from a to {3 which maximizes (or minimizes) the integral. Now we can show
that G is a continuously differentiable function from (an open subset of) V to R
The easiest way to do this is to let X be the space e([a, b], W) of continuous arcs
under the uniform norm, and to consider first the more general functional K
from X X X to IR defined by K(f, g) =
F(j(t), get), t) dt. By Theorem 14.3
the integrand map <f, g>- 1---+ F(jO, gO, .) is differentiable from X X X to
e([a, b]) and its differential at <f, g>- evaluated at < h, k>- is the function

f:

f:

f:

Sincef 1---+
f(t) is a bounded linear functional on e, it is differentiable and equal
to its differential. The composite-function rule therefore implies that K is

[dF1(h(t))

where the partial differentials in the integrand are at the point <f(t), get), t>-.
Now the pairs <f, g>- such thatf' exists and equals g form a closed subspace of
X X X which is isomorphic to V. It is obvious that they form a subspace, but
to see that it is closed requires the theory of the integral for parametrized arcs
from Chapter 4, for it depends on the representation f(t) = f(a)
f~ !,(s) ds
and the consequent norm inequality Ilf(t) - f(a) II :::; (t - a) 11!'1100. Assuming
this, we see that our original functional G is just the restriction of K to this subspace (isomorphic to) V, and hence is differentiable with

+

This differential dGf is called the first variation of G about f.
The fixed endpoints a and {3 for the arc f determine in turn a closed plane P
in V, for the evaluation maps (coordinate projections) 7rz: f 1---+ f(x) are bounded
and P is the intersection of the hyperplanes 7ra = a and 7rb = {3. Since P is a

for all h in M.
We come now to the special trick of the calculus of variations, called the
lemma of Du Bois-Reymond.
Suppose for simplicity that W = IR. Then F is a function F(x, y, t) of three
real variables, the partial differentials are equivalent to ordinary partial derivatives, and our critical-point equation is

dG/(h) =

(aF . h + aF . h') = O.

If we integrate the first term in the integral by parts and remember that h(a)
h(b) = 0, we see that the equation becomes

=

where g = h'. Since h is an arbitrary continuously differentiable function except
for the constraints h(a) = h(b) = 0, we see that g is an arbitrary continuous
function except for the constraint f: get) dt = O. That is, aFjay - faFjax is
orthogonal to the null space N of the linear functional g ~ f: get) dt. Since the
one-dimensional space N 1. is clearly the set of constant functions,

our condition becomes

aF
taF
ay (f(t),f'(t), t) = Jo ax (f(s),I'(s), s) ds + C.
This equation implies, in particular, that the left member is differentiable. This
is not immediately apparent, since!, is only assumed to be continuous. Differentiating, we conclude finally that I is a critical point of the mapping G if and
only if it is a solution of the differential equation

:t :: (f(t),!'(t), t) =

which is called the Euler equation of the variational problem. It is an ordinary
differential equation for the unknown function I; when the indicated derivative

vector equation is equivalent to n scalar equations

This has been only a quick look at the variational calculus, and the interested
reader can pursue it further in treatises devoted to the subject. There are many
more questions of the general type we have considered. For example, we may
want neither fixed nor completely free endpoints but freedom subj~ct to constraints. We shall take this up in Chapter 13 in the special case of the variational equations of mechanics. Or again, / may be a function of two or more
variables and the integral may be a multiple integral. In this case the Euler
equation may become a system of partial differential equations in the unknown/.
Finally, there is the question of sufficient conditions for the critical function to
give. a maximum or minimum value to the integral. This will naturally involve a
study of the second differential of the functional G, or its second variation, as it is
known in this subject.

*16. THE SECOND DIFFERENTIAL AND
THE CLASSIFICATION OF CRITICAL POIN.TS

Suppose that V and Ware normed linear spaces, that A is an open subset of V,
and that F: A ~ W is a continuously differentiable mapping. The first differential of F is the continuous mapping dF: l' ~ dF-y from A to Hom(V, W). W('
now want to study the differentiability of this mapping at the point a. Prpsumably, we know what it means to say that dF is differentiable at a. By
definition d(dF)a is a bounded linear transformation T from V to Hom(V, W)
such that A(dF)a(1]) - T(1]) = 0(1]). That is, dF a+'1 - dF a - T(7J) is all
element of Hom(V, W) of norm less than el17J11 for 71 sufficiently small. We St't
d2Fa = d(dF)a and repeat: d2Fa = d2FaO is a linear map from V to Hom(V, W),
d2Fa(1]) = d2Fa(1])(-) is an element of Hom(V, W), and d 2F a(1])U) is a vector
in W. Also, we know that d 2F a is equivalent to a bounded bilinear map

w:Vx V~W,
where w(7J, t) = d2Fa(1])(t).
The vector d 2F a(7J)(t) clearly ought to be some kind of second derivative of
F at a, and the reader might even conjecture that it is the mixed derivative ill
the directions t and 1].
Theorem 16.1. If F: A ~ W is continuously differentiable, and if th('
second differential d 2Fa exists, then for each fixed p. E V the functioll
D!,F: l' ~ D!,F(1') from A to W is differentiable at a and Dp(D!,F)(a) =
(d 2 Fa(V)) (p.),

Proof, We use the evaluation-at-p. map eVIL: Hom(V, W) ~ W defined for a
fixed p. in V by ev!'(T) = T(p.). It is a bounded linear mapping. Then
(D!,F)(a)

= dFa(p.) = ev!'(dFa) = (ev!, dF)(a),
0

so that the function D!,F is the composition eVIL 0 dF. It is differentiable at
because d(dF)a exists and eVIL is linear. Thus (Dp(D!,F))(a) = d(D!,F)a(v) =c
d(ev!, 0 dF)a(v) = (ev!, 0 d(dF)a) (v) = ev!'[(d 2F a)(v)] = (d2F a(V)) (p.). 0

The reader must remember in going through the above argument that D!,F

Thus,
Corollary I. If V = IR n in the above theorem, then the existence of d 2 Fa
implies the existence of all the second partial derivatives (o2FjoXi OXj) (a)
and

Moreover, from the above considerations and Theorem 9.3 we can also
conclude that:
Theorem 16.2. If V = IR n , and if all the second partial derivatives
(o2F /OXi OXj) (a) exist and are continuous on the open set A, then the
second differential d2Fa exists on A and is continuous.
Proof. We have directly from Theorem 9.3 that each first partial derivative

(oF /OXj)(') is differentiable. But ofI OXj = eVa; a dF, and the corollary is then a
consequence of the following general principle. 0
Lemma. If {Si}~ is a finite collection of linear maps on a vector space W
such that S = -<S1, ... , Sk> is invertible, then a mapping F: A ~ W is

Proof. For then S

These considerations clearly extend to any number of differentiations. Thus,
if d 2F(.): y ~ d 2Fy is differentiable at a, then for fixed band c the evaluation
d 2F(.)(b, c) is differentiable at a and the formula

shows (for special choices of b and c) that all the second partials (o2F loxj OXi)(')
are differentiable at a, with

Conversely, if all the third partials exist and are continuous on A, then the
~econd partials are differentiable on A by Theorem 9.3, and then d 2F(.) is

differentiable by the lemma, since (o2F loxi OXj)(-) = ev <ai,a;> a d 2F(.).
As the reader will remember, it is crucially important in working with
higher-order derivatives that o2Floxi OXj = o2Flo.'Cj OXi, and we very much
need the same theorem here.
Theorem 16.3. The second differential is a symmetric function of its two
arguments: (d2Fa(7J)(~) = (d 2F a(O) (7J).

The reader will remember from the elementary calculus that a critical
point a for a function / [f'(a) = 0] is a relative extremum point if the second
derivativef"(a) exists and is not zero. In fact, if f"(a) < 0, then/has a relative
maximum at a, becausef"(a) < 0 implies thatf' is decreasing in a neighborhood
of a and the graph of / is therefore concave down in a neighborhood of a. Similarly, / has a relative minimum at a if f'(a) = 0 and f"(a) > O. If f"(a) = 0,
nothing can be concluded.
If / is a real-valued function defined on an open set A in a finite-dimensional
vector space V, if ex E A is a critical point of /, and if d2/a. exists and is a non-

singular element of Hom(V, V*), then we can draw similar conclusions about the
behavior of I near a, only now there is a richer variety of possibilities. The
reader is probably already familiar with what happens for a function I from 1R2
to IR. Then a may be a relative maximum point (a "cap" point on the graph
of I), a relative minimum point, or a saddle point as shown in Fig. 3.13 for the
graph of the translated function t:./a. However, it must be realized that new
axes may have to be chosen for the orientation of the saddle to the axes to look as
shown. Replacing I by t:./a amounts to supposing that 0 is the critical point and
that 1(0) = o. Note that if 0 i~_ a saddle point, then there are two complementary subspaces, the coordinate axes in the Fig. 3.13, such that 0 is a relative
maximum for Iwhen/is restricted to one of them, and a relative minimum point
for the restriction of I to the other.

Fig. 3.13

We shall now investigate the general case and find that it is just like the
two-dimensional case except that when there is a saddle point the subspace on
which the critical point is a maximum point may have any dimension from 1
to n - 1 [where d(V) = n). Moreover, this dimension is exactly the number of
-l's in the standard orthonormal basis representation of the quadratic form
q(~)

=

wa, ~) = d2IOt(~, ~).

Our hypotheses, then, are that I is a continuously differentiable real-valued
function on an open subset of a finite-dimensional normed linear space V, that
a E A is a critical point for I (dla = 0), and that the mapping d 21a.: V --+ V*
exists and is nonsingular. This last hypothesis is equivalent to assuming that the
bilinear form
'7) = d2Ia(~, '7) has a nonsingular matrix with respect to any
basis for V. We now use Theorem 7.1 of Chapter 2 to choose an w-orthonormal
basis {ai}~' Remember that this means that w(ai' aj) = 0 if i ¢ j, w(ai' ai) = 1
1, ... ,n. There cannot be
for i = 1, ... ,p, and w(ai' ai) = -1 for i = p
any 0 values for w(ai' ai) because the Inatrix tij = w(ai' aj) is nonsingular: if
w(ai' ai) = 0, then the whole ith column is zero, the column space has dimension :::;; n - 1, and the Inatrix is singular.
We can use the basis isomorphism tp to replace V by IR" (i.e., replace I by
1 0 tp), and we can therefore suppose that V = IR" and that the standard basis is

a 2flaxl = 1 for i = 1, ... ,p, and a 2flaxl = -1 for i = p + 1, ... , n.
Since p can have any value from 0 to n, there are n + 1 possibilities. We show
first that if p = n, then a is a relative minimum of f. In this case the quadratic
form q is said to be positive definite, since q(x) = w(x, x) is positive for every
nonzero x. We also say that the bilinear form w(x, y) = d 2fa(x, y) is positive
definite, and, in the language of Chapter 5, that w is a scalar product.

f be a continuously differentiable real-valued function
defined on an open subset A of R n , and let a E A be a critical point of fat
which d 2f exists and is positive definite. Thenf has a relative minimum at a.

the two-norm on IR and set y = tx, we have
Also, if h(t) = f(a + tx), then h'(s) = dfa+8x(X), and this inequality therefore
says that (1 - E)tllxl1 2 ::::; h'(t) ::::; (1 + E)tllxI1 2 • Integrating, and remembering
that h(l) - h(O) = f(a + x) - f(a) = fl.fa(x), we have

complementary space V 2 = L({~i}~+l)'
According to our remarks at the end of Section 2.7, we can read off the type
of a critical point for a function of two variables without orthonormalizing by
looking at the determinant of the matrix of the (assumed nonsingular) form d 2fa.

If it is positive, then a is either a relative minimum or a relative maximum. We
can tell which by following f along a single line, say the xraxis. Thus, if
a2f/ax~ < 0, then a is a relative maximum point. On the other hand, if the
above expression is negative, then a is a saddle point.
It is important for the calculus of variations that Theorem 16.4 remains
true when the domain space is replaced by a space of the general type that we
shall study in the next chapter, called a Banach space. The hypotheses now are
that a is a critical point of f, that q(~) = dfa(~, ~) is positive definite, and that
the scalar product norm qlJ 2 (see Chapter 5) is equivalent to. the given norm on
V. The proof remains virtually unchanged.
*17. HIGHER ORDER DIFFERENTIALS. THE TAYLOR FORMULA

We have seen that if V and Ware normed linear spaces, and if F is a differentiable mapping from an open set A in V to W, then its differential dF = dF(o)
is a mapping from A to Hom(V, W). If this mapping is differentiable on A, then
its differential d(dF) = d(dFk) is a mapping from A to Hom(V, Hom(V, W)).
We remember that an element of Hom(V, Hom(V, W)) is equivalent by duality
to a bilinear mapping from V X V to W, and if we designate the space of all such
bilinear mappings by Hom 2(V, W), then d(dF) can be considered to be from A to
Hom 2(V, W). We write d(dF) = d 2F, and call this mapping the second differential of F. In Section 16 we saw that d2Fa(~, 1/) = D~(D'1F)(a), and that if
V = IR n , then

is differentiable on A, then its differential, d(d 2F) = d 3F, is from A to
Hom(V, Hom 2(V, W)) = Hom 3 (V, W), the space of all trilinear mappings from
V 3 = V X V X V to W. Continuing inductively, we arrive at the notion of the nth
differential of F on A as a mapping from A to Hom(V, Hom n- 1(V, W)) =
Homn(V, W), the space of all n-linear mappings from vn to W. The theorem
that d2Fa is a symmetric element of Hom 2(V, W) extends inductively to show
that dnFa is a symmetric element of Homn(V, W). We shall omit this proof.
Our theorem on the evaluation of the second differential by mixed directional
derivatives also generalizes by induction to give

The above description is logically simple, but it is inefficient in that it repeats
identical terms such as YIY2(a2Fjaxl aX2) and Y2Yl(a2Fjax2 aXl). We conclude
by describing for the interested reader the modern "multi-index" notation for this
very complicated situation.
Remember that we are looking at the mth term of the Taylor formula for F,
and that F has n variables.
For any n-tuple k = -< kll ... , kn >- of nonnegative integers, we define jkj
as L~ ki' and for x E IR n, we set Xk = XlklXl2 ... x nkn . Also we set Fk =

is designated Ck(A, W) or ek(A, W). It is clear that Ck(A, W) is a vect(i)l"'Space
(induction). Moreover, it can also be shown by induction that a composition
of Ck-maps is itself of class Ck. This depends on <recognizing the generail form of
the mth differential of a composition FoG as being a finite sum, each term of
which is a composition of functions chosen from F, dF, ... , dmF, G, dG, ... , dmG.
Functions of many variables are involved in these calculations, and it is
simplest to treat each as a function of a single n-tuplet variable and to apply the
obvious corollary of Theorem 8.1 that if Gt, ... , Gn are of class Ck, then so is
G = -< Gr, ... , Gn>, with dkG = -< dkGt, ... , dkGn>. As a special case of
composition, we can conclude that a product of Ck-maps is of class Ck.
We shall see in the next chapter that cP: T ~ T- I is a differentiable map on
the open set of invertible elements in Hom V (if V is a Banach space) and that
dCPT(H) = - T-IHT- I. Since -<S, H, T> ~ S-IHT-Ithen has continuous partial differentials, we can continue, and another induction shows that cP is of class
Ck for every k and that dm'PT(H b . . . , H m) is a finite sum of finite products of
T-t, HI, ... , H m' 'It then follows that a function F defined implicitly by a Ck_
function G is also of class ck, for its differential, as computed in the implicitfunction theorem, is then a composition of maps of class Ck-I.
A mapping F which is of class Ck for all k is said to be of class Coo, and it
follows from our remarks above that the family of Coo-maps is closed under all
the operations that we have met in the calculus. If the domain of F is an open
set in IRn, then FE eOO(A, W) if and only if all the partial derivatives of F exist
and are continuous on A.

CHAPTER 4

COMPACTNESS AND COMPLETENESS

In this chapter we shall investigate two properties of subsets of a normed linear
space V which are concerned with the fact that in a certain sense all the points
which ought to be there really are there. These notions are largely independent
of the algebraic structure of V, and we shall therefore study them in their own
most natural setting, that of metric spaces. The stronger of these two properties,
compactness, helps to explain why the theory of finite-dimensional spaces is so
simple and satisfactory. The weaker property, completeness, is shared by
important infinite-dimensional normed linear spaces, and allows us to treat
these spaces in almost as satisfactory a way.
It is these properties that save the calculus from being largely a formal
theory. They allow us to define crucial elements by limiting processes, and are
responsible, for example, for an infinite series having a sum, a continuous realvalued function assuming a maximum value, and a definite integral existing.
For the real number system itself, the compactness property is equivalent to the
least upper bound property, which has already been an absolutely essential tool
in our construction of the differential calculus in Chapter 3.
In Sections 8 through 10 we shall apply completeness to the calculus. The
first of these sections is devoted to the existence and differentiability of functions
defined by power series, and since we want to include power series in an operator
T, we shall take the occasion to introduce and exploit the notion of a Banach
algebra. Next we shall prove the contraction mapping fixed-point theorem, which
is the missing ingredient in our unfinished proof of the implicit-function theorem
in Chapter 3 and which will be the basis for the fundamental existence and
uniqueness theorem for ordinary differential equations in Chapter 6. In Section
10 we shall prove a simple extension theorem for linear mappings into a complete
normed linear space and apply it to construct the Riemann integral of a paramatrized arc.
1. METRIC SPACES; OPEN AND CLOSED SETS

In the preceding chapter we occasionally treated questions of convergence and
continuity in situations where the domain was an arbitrary subset A of a normed
linear space V. In such discussions the algebraic structure of V fades into the
background, and the vector operations of V are used only to produce the combi195

nation Iia - !311, which is interpreted as the distance from a to!3. If we distill
out of these contexts what is essential to the convergence and continuity arguments, we find that we need a space A and a function p: A X A ~ JR, p(x, y)
being called the distance from x to y, such that

>

0 if x ¥- y, and p(x, x) = 0;
2) p(x, y) = p(y, x) for all x, YEA;
3) p(x, z) ::; p(x, y)
p(y, z) for all x, y, z E A.
1) p(x, y)

+

Any set A together with such a function p from A X A to JR is called a metric
space; the function p is the metric. It is obvious that a normed linear space is a
metric space under the norm metric pea,
= Iia - !311 and that any subset B
of a metric space A is itself a metric space under p r B X B. If we start with a
nice intuitive space, like JRn under one of its standard norms, and choose a weird
subset B, it will be clear that a metric space can be a very odd object, and may
fail to have almost any property one can think of.
Metric spaces very often arise in practice as subsets of normed linear
spaces with the norm metric, but they come from other sources too. Even in the
normed linear space context, metrics other than the norm metric are used.
For example, S might be a two-dimensional spherical surface in JR3, say S =
{x : r:,~ xl = I}, and p(x, y) might be the great circle distance from x to y. Or,
more generally, S might be any smooth two-dimensional surface in JR3, and
p(x, y) might be the length of the shortest curve connecting x to y in S.
In this chapter we shall adopt the metric space context for our arguments
wherever it is appropriate, so that the student may become familiar with this
more general but very intuitive notion. We begin by reproducing the basic
definitions in the language of metrics. Because the scalar-vector dichotomy is
not a factor in this context, we shall drop our convention that points be represented by Greek or boldface roman letters and shall use whatever letters we wish.

Here we have used the same symbol' p' for metrics on different spaces, just

Definition. The (open) ball oj radius r about p, BT(p), is simply the set of
points whose distance from p is less that r:

BT(P)

= {x :p(x, p) < r}.

Definition. A subset A C X is open if every point p in A is the center of
some ball included in A, that is, if

LeDlDla 1.1. Every ball is open; in fact, if q E Br(P) and
then Ba(q) C Br(P).

a=

r -

197
p(p, q),

Proof. This amounts to the triangle inequality. For, if x E Ba(q), then p(x, q) <
a and p(x, p) ~ p(x, q) + p(q, p) < a+ p(p, q) = r, so that x E Br(P).
Thus Ba(q) C Br(P). 0
LeDlDla 1.2. If P is held fixed, then p(p, x) is a continuous function of x.

Proof. A symbol-by-symbol paraphrase of Lemma 3.1 of Chapter 3 shows that
Ip(p, x) - p(p, y)1 ~ p(x, y), so that p(p, x) is actually a Lipschitz function
with constant 1. 0
TheoreDl 1.1. The family ~ of all open subsets of a metric space S has the

following properties:
1) The union of any collection of open sets is open; that is, if {Ai: i E J} C
~, then UiEI Ai E ~.
2) The intersection of two open sets is open; that is, if A, B E ~, then
A nB E~.
3) 0, V E~.

Proof. These properties follow immediately from the definition. Thus any
point p in Ui A i lies in some A j, and therefore, since A j is open, some ball about p
is a subset of Aj and hence of the larger set Ui Ai. 0
Corollary. A set is open if and only if it is a union of open balls.

Proof. This follows from the definition of open set, the lemma above, and
property (1) of the theorem. 0
The union of all the open subsets of an arbitrary set A is an open subset of

A, by (1), and therefore is the largest open subset of A. It is called the interior
of A and is designated A into Clearly, p is in A int if and only if some ball about p
is a subset of A, and it is helpful to visualize A int as the union of all the balls
that are in A.
Definition. A set A is closed if A' is open.

The theorem above and De Morgan's law (Section 0.11) then yield the
following complementary set of properties for closed sets.
TheoreDl 1.2

1) The intersection of any family of closed sets is closed.
2) The union of two closed sets is closed.
3) 0 and V are closed.

Proof. Suppose, for example, that {Bi: i E J} is a family of closed sets. Then
the complement
is open for each i, so that Ui
is open by the above theorem.

COMPACTNESS AND COMPLETENESS

Also, UiB[ = miBi)' by De Morgan's law (see Section 0.11). Thus niBi is
the complement of an open set and is closed. 0
Continuing our "complementary" development, we define the closure, if, of
an arbitrary set A as the intersection of all closed sets including A, and we have
from (1) above that if is the smallest closed set including A. De Morgan's law
implies the important identity
For F is a closed superset of A if and only if its complement U = F' is an open
subset of A'. By De Morgan's law the complement of the intersection of all such
sets F is the union of all such sets U. That is, the complement of if is (A')int.
This identity yields a direct characterization of closure:
Lemma 1.3. A point p is in

if if and only if every ball about p intersects A.

Proof. A point p is not in if if and only if p is in the interior of A', that is, if and
only if some ball about p does not intersect A. Negating the extreme members

of this equivalence gives the lemma. 0
Definition. The boundary, iJA, of an arbitrary set A is the difference
between its closure and its interior. Thus

iJA

= if -

Aint.

Since A - B = A n B', we have the symmetric characterization iJA
if n (A'). Therefore, iJA = iJ(A') j also,

=

p E iJA if and only if every ball about p intersects both A and A'.
Example. A ball Br(a) is an open set. In a normed linear space the closure of

Br(a) is the closed ball about a of radius r, H : p(~, a) ~ r}. This is easily seen
from Lemma 1.3. The boundary iJBr(a) is then the spherical surface of radius I'
about a, H: p(~, a) = r}. If some but not all of the points of this surface are
added to the open ball, we obtain a set that is neither open nor closed. The
student should expect that a random set he may encounter will be neither open
nor closed.

Continuous functions furnish an important source of open and closed sets
by the following lemma.
Lemma 1.4. If X and Yare metric spaces, and if f is a continuous mapping

from X to Y, then f-I[A] is open in X whenever A is open in Y.
Proof. If pEr I [A], then f(p) E A, and, since A is open, some ball B. (f(p)
is a subset of A. But the continuity of fat p says exactly that there is a ~ such
that f[Ba(p)] C B.(f(p). In particular, f[Ba(p)] C A and Ba(P) Cf-I[A].
Thus for each p inrI[A] there is a ball about p included inf-I[A], and this set
is therefore open. 0

4.1

METRIC SPACES; OPEN AND CLOSED SETS

Since f-I[A']

=

199

(f-I[A])', we also have the following corollary.

Corollary. Iff: X -- Y is continuous, thenrI[C] is closed in X whenever C

is closed in Y.
The converses of both of these results hold as well. As an example of the use
of this lemma, consider for a fixed a E X the continuous function f: X -- IR
defined by f(~D = p(~, a). The sets (-1',1'), [0,1'], and {r} are respectively open,
closed, and closed subsets of IR. Therefore, their inverse images under f-the ball
Br(a), the closed ball
pa, a) ~ r}, and the spherical surface
p(~, a) = r}
----<are respectively open, closed, and closed in X. In particular, the triangle
inequality argument demonstrating directly that Br(a) is open is now seen to be
unnecessary by virtue of the triangle inequality argument that demonstrates the
continuity of the distance function (Lemma 1.2).
It is not true that continuous functions take closed sets into closed sets in the
forward direction. For example, if f: IR -- IR is the arc tangent function, then
f[lR] = range f = (-7r /2, 7r/2), which is not a closed subset of IR. The reader
may feel that this example cheats and that we should only expect the f-image of a
closed set to be a closed subset of the metric space that is the range of f. He
might then consider f(x) = 2x/(1
x 2 ) from IR to its range [-1, 1]. The set
of positive integers Z+ is a closed subset of IR, but f[Z+] = {2n/ (1
n 2 )} ~ is not
closed in [-1, 1], since 0 is clearly in its closure.
The distance between two nonempty sets A and B, p(A, B), is defined as
glb {p( a, b) : a E A and b E B}. If A and B intersect, the distance is zero.
If A and B are disjoint, the distance may still be zero. For example, the interior
and exterior of a circle in the plane are disjoint open sets whose distance apart is
zero. The x-axis and (the graph of) the function f(x) = l/x are disjoint closed
sets whose distance apart is zero. As we have remarked earlier, a set A is closed
if and only if every point not in A is a positive distance from A. More generally,
for any set A a point p is in A if and only if p(p, A) = o.
We list below some simple properties of the distance between subsets of a
normed linear space.

The reader may feel that we ought to be able to improve this lemma. Surely,
all we have to do is choose the point in N which is closest to (3, and so obtain
11{3 - 7111 = p({3, N), giving finally a vector a such that Iiall = 1 and p(a, N) = 1.
However, this is a matter on which our intuition lets us down: if N is infinitedimensional, there may not be a closest point 71! For example, as we shall see
later in the exercises of Chapter 5, if V is the space e([ -1, 1]) under the twonorm Ilfll = (f!l f2)1/2, and if N is the set of functions g in V such that U g = 0,
then N is a closed subspace for which we cannot find such a "best" Ci. But if N is
finite-dimensional, we can always find such a point, and if V is a Hilbert space,
(see Chapter 5) we can also.

*2. TOPOLOGY

If X is an arbitrary set and 3 is any family of subsets of X satisfying properties
(1) through (3) in Theorem 1.1, then 3 is called a topology on X. Theorem 1.1
thus asserts that the open subsets of a metric space X form a topology on X.
The subsequent definitions of interior, closed set, and closure were purely
topological in the sense that they depended only on the topology 3, as were
Theorem 1.2 and the identity (A), = (A')int. The study of the consequences of
the existence of a topology is called general topology.
On the other hand, the definitions of balls and continuity given earlier were
metric definitions, and therefore part of metric space theory. In metric spaces,
then, we have not only the topology, but also our E-definitions of continuity and
balls and the spherical characterizations of closure and interior.
The reader may be surprised to be told now that although continuity and
convergence were defined metrically, they also have purely topological characterizations and are therefore topological ideas. This is easy to see if one keeps
in mind that in a metric space an open set is nothing but a union of balls. We
have:

f is continuous at p if and only if for every open set A containing f(p) there
exists an open set B containing p such that f[B] C A.
This local condition involving behavior around a single point p is more
fluently rendered in terms of the notion of neighborhood. A set A is a neighborhood of a point p if pEA into Then we have:
f is continuous at p if and only if for every neighborhood N of f(p) , r1[N]
is a neighborhood of p.
Finally there is an elegant topological characterization of global continuity.
Suppose that 8 1 and 8 2 are topological spaces. Then f: 8 1 -+ 8 2 is continuous

(everywhere) if and only if rl[A] is open whenever A is open. Also, f is continuous if and only if f-l[B] is closed whenever B is closed. These conditionH
are not surprising in view of Lemma 1.4.
3. SEQUENTIAL CONVERGENCE

In addition to shifting to the more general point of view of metric space theory,
we also want to add to our kit of tools the notion of sequential convergence,
which the reader will probably remember from his previous encounter with the
calculus. One of the principal reasons why metric space theory is simpler and
more intuitive than general topology is that nearly all metric arguments can be
presented in terms of sequential convergence, and in this chapter we shall
partially make up for our previous neglect of this tool by using it constantly and
in preference to other alternatives.
Definition. We say that the infinite sequence {xn} converges to the point a

if for every

E

there is an N such that
n

>N

=> p(xn' a)

<

E.

We also say that Xn approaches a as n approaches (or tends to) infinity, and
we call a the limit of the sequence. In symbols we write Xn ~ a as n ~ 00, or
limn-+oo Xn = a. Formally, this definition is practically identical with our earlier
definition of function convergence, and where there are parallel theorems the
arguments that we use in one situation will generally hold almost verbatim in
the other. Thus the proof of Lemma 1.1 of Chapter 3 can be alternated slightly
to give the following result.
Lemma 3.1. If {M and {"Ii} are two sequences in a normed linear space V,
then
~i ~ a and 7Ji ~ {3 => ~i + 7Ji ~ a + {3.
The main difference is that we now choose N as max {N b N 2} instead of
choosing ~ as min {~1' ~2}. Similarly:
Lemma 3.2. If

~i ~

a in V and

Xi ~

a in IR, then

Xi~i ~

aa.

As before, the definition begins with three quantifiers, (VE) (3N) (Vn). A
somewhat more idiomatic form can be obtained by rephrasing the definition in
terms of balls and the notion of "almost all n". We say that P(n) is true for
almost all n if P(n) is true for all but a finite number of integers n, or equivalently,
if (3N)(Vn>N)P(n). Then we see that
lim Xn = a if and only if every ball about a contains almost all the

Xn •

The following sequential characterization provides probably the most
intuitive way of viewing the notion of closure and closed sets.

Theorem. 3.1. A point x is in the closure A of a set A if and only if there is a

sequence {xn} in A converging to x.
Therefore, a set A is closed if and only if every convergent sequence lying
in A has its limit in A.

Proof. If {Xn} C A and Xn ~ x, then every ball about x contains almost every
and so, in particular, intersects A. Thus x E A by Lemma 1.3. Conversely,
if x E A, then every ball about x intersects A, and we can construct a sequence in
A that converges to x by choosing Xn as any point in B lin (X) n A. Since A is
closed if and only if A = A, the second statement of the theorem follows from
the first. 0
Xn>

There is also a sequential characterization of continuity which helps greatly
in using the notion of continuity in a flexible way. Let X and Y be metric spaces,
and let f be any function from X to Y.
Theorelll 3.2. The function f is continuous at a if and only if, for any
sequence {xn} in X, if Xn ~ a, then f(xn) ~ f(a).

Proof. Suppose first that f is continuous at a, and let {xn} be any sequence
converging to a. Then, given any E, there is a 0 such that
p(X , a)

<

0

=}

p(j(x) , f(a))

E,

by the continuity of f at a, and for this 0 there is an N such that

n

>

N

=}

p(xn , a)

<

0,

because ;t·n ~ a. Combining these implications, we see that given E we have
found N so that n > N = } p(f(xn) , f(a)) < E. That is, f(xn) ~ f(a).
N ow suppose that f is not continuous at a. In considering such a negation
it is important that implicit universal quantifiers be made explicit. Thus, formally, we are assuming that ~(V'E)(30)(V'x)(p(x , a) < 0 = } p(j(X) , f(a)) < E),
that is, that (3E)(V'0)(3x)(p(x, a) < 0 &p(f(x) ,f(a)) ~ E). Such symbolization
will not be necessary after the reader has had some practice in computing logical
negations; the experienced thinker will intuit the correct negation without a
formal calculation. In any event, we now have a fixed E, and for each 0 of the
form 0 = lin we can let Xn be a corresponding x. We then have p(xn , a) < lin
and p(f(xn) , f(a)) ~ E for all n. The first inequality shows tnat Xn ~ a; the
second shows that f(xn)
f(a). Thus, if f is not continuous at a, then the
sequential condition is not satisfied. 0

+

The above type of argument is used very frequently and almost amounts to
an automatic proof procedure in the relevant situations. We want to prove, say,
that (V'x)(3y)(V'z)P(x, y, z). Arguing by contradiction, we suppose this false, so
that (3x)(V'y)(3z)~P(x, y, z). Then, instead of trying to use all numbers y, we
let y run through some sequence converging to zero, such as (lIn}, and we choose

204

one corresponding z, Zn, for each such y. We end up with "",P(x, lin, zn) for the
given x and all n, and we finish by arguing sequentially.
The reader will remember that two norms p and q on a vector space V are
equivalent if and only if the identity map ~ 1-+ ~ is continuous from -< V, p>- to
-< V, q>- and also from -< V, q>- to -< V, p>-. By virtue of the above theorem
we now see that:
Theorem 3.3. The norms p and q are equivalent if and only if they yield
exactly the same collection of convergent sequences.
Earlier we argued that a norm on a product V X W of two normed linear
spaces should be equivalent to 11-< a, ~ >- III = lIall + II ~II. Now with respect to
this sum norm it is clear that a sequence -< an, ~n >- in V X W converges to
-< a, ~ >- if and only if an ---+ a in V and ~n ---+ ~ in W. We now see (again by
Theorem 3.2) that:
Theorem 3.4. A product norm on V X W is any norm with the property
that -< an, ~n >- ---+ -< a, ~ >- in V X W if and only if an ---+ a in V and

4. SEQUENTIAL COMPACTNESS

The reader is probably familiar with the idea of a subsequence. A subsequence of
a sequence {xn} is a new sequence {Ym} that is formed by selecting an infinite
number, but generally not all, of the terms X n , and counting them off in the
order of the selected indices. Thus, if nl is the first selected n, n2 the next, and
so on, and if we set Ym = x n.. , then we obtain the subsequence
or
Strictly speaking, this counting off of the selected set of indices n is a sequence
m ~ nm from Z+ to Z+ which preserves order: nm+l > nm for all m. And the
subsequence m ~ x n ... is the composition of the sequence n ~ Xn and the
selector sequence.
In order to avoid subscripts on subscripts, we may use the notation n(m)
instead of n m • In either case we are being conventionally sloppy: we are using
the same symbol' n' as an integer-valued variable, when we write X n , and as the
selector function, when we write n(m) or nm • This is one of the standard nota-

206

COMPA€TNESS AND COMPLETENESS

tional ambiguities which we tolerate in elementary calculus, because the cure is
considered worse than the disease. We could say: let f be a sequence, i.e., a
function from Z+ to IR. Then a subsequence of f is a composition fog, where g
is a mapping from Z+ to Z+ such that g(m + 1) > g(m) for all m.
If you have grasped the idea of subsequence, you should be able to see that
any infinite sequence of O's and l's, say {O, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, ... }, can be
obtained as a subsequence of {O, 1,0, 1,0, 1, ... , [1 + (-1)n]/2, ...}.
If Xn --+ a, then it should be clear that every subsequence also converges to a.
We leave the details as an exercise. On the other hand, if the sequence {xn}
does not converge to a, then there is an E such that for every N there is some
larger n at which p(xn' a) ~ E. Now we can choose such an n for every N,
taking care that nN+l > nN, and thus choose a subsequence all of whose terms
are at a distance at least E from a. Then this sequence has no subsequence
converging to a. Thus, if {Xn} does not converge to a, then it has a subsequence
no (sub )subsequence of which converges to a. Therefore,
Lemma 4.1. If the sequence {xn} and the point a are such that every
subsequence of {xn} has itself a subsequence that converges to a, then
Xn --+ a.
This is a wild and unlikely sounding lemma, but we shall use it to prove a
most important theorem (Theorem 4.2).
Definition. A subset A of a metric space is sequentially compact if every
sequence in A has a subsequence that converges to a point of A.

Here, so to speak, we create convergence out of nothing. One would expect
a compact set to have very powerful properties, and perhaps suspect that there
aren't many such sets. We shall soon see, however, that every bounded closed
subset of IRn is compact, and it is in the theory of finite-dimensional spaces that
we most frequently use this notion. Sequential compactness in infinite-dimensional spaces is a much rarer phenomenon, but when it does occur it is very
important, as we shall see in our brief look at Sturm-Liouville theory in Chapter 6.
We begin with a few simple but important general results.
Lemma 4.2. If A is a sequentially compact subset of a metric space S,
then A is closed and bounded.
Proof. Suppose that {xn} C A and that Xn --+ b. By the compactness of A
there exists'a subsequence {Xn(i)}i that converges to a point a EA. But a subsequence of a convergent sequence converges to the same limit. Therefore,
a = band b E A. Thus A is closed.
Boundedness here will mean lying in some ball about a given point b. If A
is not bounded, for each n there exists a point Xn E A such that p(x n, b) > n.
By compactness a suBsequence {Xn(i)}i converges to a point a E A, and
P(Xn(i),

This clearly contradicts P(Xn(i), b)

Continuous functions carry compact sets into compact sets. The proof of
the following result is left as an exercise.
TheorelD 4.1. If f is continuous and A is a sequentially compact subset of its
domain, then I[A] is sequentially compact.

A nonempty compact set A C iii' contains maximum and minimum elements.
This is because lub A is the limit of a sequence in A, and hence belongs to A
itself, since A is closed. Combining this fact with the above theorem, we obtain
the following well-known corollary.
Corollary. Iff is a continuous real-valued function and dom (f) is nonempty
and sequentially compact, then f is bounded and assumes maximum and
minimum values.

The following very useful result is related to the above theorem.
4.2. If f is continuous and bijective and dom (f) is sequentially
compact, then 1 is continuous.

TheorelD

r

Proof. We have to show that if Yn ~ Y in the range of I, and if Xn = f-1(Yn)
and: x = rl(y), then Xn ~ x. It is sufficient to show that every subsequence
{Xn(i)}i has itself a subsequence converging to x (by Lemma 4.1). But, since
dom (f) is compact, there is a subsequence {Xn(i(i»} i converging to some z, and
the continuity of f implies that f(z) = limi->oc f(Xn(i(j») = limi->oc Yn(i(j» = y.
Therefore, z = r1(y) = x, which is what we had to prove. Thus 1 is continuous. 0

r

We now take up the problem of showing that bounded closed sets in IR n are
compact. We first prove it for IR itself and then give an inductive argument
for IRn.
A sequence {xn} C IR is said to be increasing if Xn ~ x n+1 for all n. It is
strictly increasing if Xn < Xn+1 for all n. The notions of a decreasing sequence
and a strictly decreasing sequence are obvious. A sequence which is either increasing or decreasing is said to be monotone. The relevance of these notions here lies
in the following two lemmas.
LelDlDa

4.3. A bounded monotone sequence in IR is convergent.

Proof. Suppose that {xn} is increasing and bounded above. Let 1 be the least
upper bound of its range. That is, Xn ~ 1 for all n, but for every E, 1 - E is not an
upper bound, and so 1 - E < XN for some N. Then

4.4. Any sequence in IR has a monotone subsequence.

Proof. Call Xn a peak term if it is greater than or equal to all later terms. If
there are infinitely many peak terms, then they obviously form a decreasing

208

4.4

COMPACTNESS AND COMPLETENESS

subsequence. On the other hand, if there are only finitely many peak terms, then
there is a last one xno (or none at all), and then every later term is strictly less
than some other still later term. We choose any n1 greater than no, and then we
can choose n2 > n1 so that x nl < x n2 ' etc. Therefore, in this case we can choose
a strictly increasing subsequence. We have thus shown that any sequence {x n }
in IR has either a decreasing subsequence or a strictly increasing subsequence. 0
Putting these two lemmas together, we have:
Theorem 4.3. Every bounded sequence in IR has a convergent subsequence.
Now we can generalize to IR n by induction.
Theorem 4.4. Every bounded sequence in IR n has a convergent subsequence
(using any product norm, say II /11)'
Proof. The above theorem is the case n = 1. Suppose then that the theorem is
true for n - 1, and let {xm}m be a bounded sequence in IRn. Thinking of IR n as
IR n- 1 X IR, we have xm = -< ym, zm>-, and {ym} m is bounded in IRn-1, because if
x = -< y, z>-, then /lx/l 1 = /ly/l 1 Izi ;::: /lyl/ 1. Therefore, there is a subsequence
{yn(i)}i converging to some y in IR n-t, by the inductive hypothesis. Since
{Zn(i)} is bounded in IR, it has a subsequence {Zn(i(p»} p converging to some x in
IR. Of course, the corresponding subsubsequence {yn(i(p»} p still converges to y
in IR n-t, and then {xn(i(p»} p converges to x = -< y, Z>- in IR n = IR n- 1 X IR,
since its two component sequences now converge to y and z, respectively. We
have thus found a convergent subsequence of {xn}. 0

+

Theorem 4.5. If A is a bounded closed subset of IRn, then A is sequentially
compact (in any product norm).
Proof. If {xn} C A, then there is a subsequence {Xn(i)}i converging to'some x
in IRn, by Theorem 4.4, and x is in A, since A is closed. Thus A is compact. 0

We can now fill in one of the minor gaps in the last chapter.
Theorem 4.6. All norms on IR n are equivalent.
Proof. It is sufficient to prove that an arbitrary norm /I /I is equivalent to
Setting a = max {I/cS i /lg, we have

/lxI/

/I /I 1.

II~ XicSill ~ ~ IXil /lcSil/ ~ al/xllt,

so one of our inequalities is trivial. We also have /lxI/ - /lyl/ ~ /Ix - yl/ ~
all X - yl/ 1, so /lxI/ is a continuous function on IR n with respect to the one-norm.
Now the unit one-sphere S = {x: /lx/l1 = I} is closed and bounded and so
compact (in the one-norm). The restriction of the continuous function /lx/I to
this compact set S has a minimum value m, and m cannot be zero because S
does not contain the zero vector. We thus have /lx/l ;::: m/lxl/1 on S, and so
/lx/l ;::: m/lxl/ 1 on IRn, by homogeneity. Altogether we have found positive
constants a and m such that m/l /I 1 ~ /I /I ~ a/l /I 1. 0

Composing with a coordinate isomorphism, we see that all norms on any

Proof. Suppose that {~n} eM and ~n -+ a E V. We have to show that a is in
M. Now an} is a bounded subset of M, and its closure in M is therefore sequentially compact, by the theorem. Therefore, some subsequence converges to
a point {3 in M as well as to a, and so a = (3 E M. 0

5. COMPACTNESS AND UNIFORMITY

The word' uniform' is frequently used as a qualifying adjective in mathematics.
Roughly speaking, it concerns a "point" property P(y) which mayor may not
hold at each point y in a domain A and whose definition involves an existential
quantifier. A typical form for P(y) is (Vc)(3d)Q(y, c, d). Thus, if P(y) is 'f is
continuous at y', then P(y) has the form (VE)(3lJ)Q(y, E, lJ). The property holds
on A if it holds for all y in A, that is, if
(VyEA)[(Vc)(3d)Q(y, c, d)].

Here d will, in general, depend both on y and c; if either y or c is changed, the
corresponding d may have to be changed. Thus lJ in the definition of continuity
depends both on E and on the point y at which continuity is being asserted. The
property is said to hold uniformly on A, or uniformly in y, if a value d can be
found that is independent of y (but still dependent on c). Thus the property holds
uniformly in y if
(Vc)(3d)(VyEA)Q(y, c, d);
the uniformity of the property is expressed in the reversal of the order of the
quantifiers (VyEA) and (3d). Thus f is uniformly continuous on A if
(VE)(3lJ)(Vy, ZEA)[p(y, z)

<

lJ ==> p(J(y), fez))

<

E].

Now lJ is independent of the point at which continuity is being asserted, but still
dependent on E, of course.
We saw in Section 14 of the last chapter how much more powerful the point
condition of continuity becomes when it holds uniformly. In the remainder of
this section we shall discuss some other uniform notions, and shall see that the
uniform property is often implied by the point property if the domain over which
it holds is sequentially compact.
The formal statement forms we have examined above show clearly the
distinction between uniformity and nonuniformity. However, in writing an
argument, we would generally follow our more idiomatic practice of dropping out

the inside universal quantifier. For example, a sequence of functions Un} C W A
converges pointwise to f: A -+ W if it converges to f at every point P in A, that
is, if for every point p in A and for every f there is an N such that

this is why the norm IIfll"" is called the uniform norm.
Pointwise convergence does not imply uniform convergence. Thus fn(x) =
xn on A = (0, 1) converges pointwise to the zero function but does not converge
uniformly.
Nor does continuity on A imply uniform continuity. The function f(x) =
1/x is continuous on (0, 1) but is not uniformly continuous. The function
sin (l/x) is continuous and bounded on (0, 1) but is not unifomlly continuous.
Compactness changes the latter situation, however.
Theorem 5.1. If f is continuous on A and A is compact, then f is uniformly
continuous on A.

Proof. This is one of our "automatic" negation proofs.
(UC) is the property

This completes the proof by nega-

The compactness of A does not, however, automatically convert the pointwise convergence of a sequence of functions on A into uniform convergence. The
"piecewise linear" functions fn: [0, 1] -+ [0, 1] defined by the graph shown in
Fig. 4.1 converge pointwise to zero on the compact domain [0, 1], but the convergence is not uniform. (However, see Exercise 5.4.)

We pointed out earlier that the distance between a pair of disjoint closed
sets may be zero. However, if one of the closed sets is compact, then the distance
must be positive.
Theorem 5.2. If A and C are disjoint nonempty closed sets, one of which is
compact, then p(A, C) > o.

Proof. The proof is by automatic contradiction, and is left to the reader.

This result is again a uniformity condition. Saying that a set A is disjoint
from a closed set C is saying that (Vx EA )(3r>O) (Br(x) n C = 0). Saying that
p(A, C) > 0 is saying that (3r>O)(Vx EA ) •••
As a last consequence of sequential compactness, we shall establish a very
powerful property which is taken as the definition of compactness in general
topology. First, however, we need some preparatory work. If A is a subset of a
metric space S, the r-neighborhood of A, Br[A], is simply the union of all the balls
of radius r about points of A:
Br[A]

= U {Br(a) : a E A} = {x: (3a EA ) (p(x, a) < r)}.

A subset A C S is r-dense in S if S C Br[A], that is, if each point of S is closer
than r to some point of A.
A subset A of a metric space S is dense in S if A = S. This is the same as
saying that for every point p in S there are points of A arbitrarily close to p.
The set iQ of all rational numbers is a dense subset of the real number system IR,
because any irrational real number x can be arbitrarily closely approximated by
rational numbers. Since we do arithmetic in decimal notation, it is customary to
use decimal approximations, and if 0 < x < 1 and the decimal expansion of
x is x = L~ an/lOn, where each an is an integer and 0 ~ an < 10, then
:Ef an/IOn is a rational number differing from x by less than lO-N. Note that A
is a dense subset of B if and only if A is r-dense in B for every positive r.
A set B is said to be totally bounded if for every positive r there is a finite set
which is r-dense in B. Thus for every positive r the set B can be covered by a
finite number of balls of radius r. For example, the n - 1 numbers {i/nH- 1 are
(l/n)-dense in the open interval (0, 1) for each n, and so (0, 1) is totally bounded.

Total boundedness is a much stronger property than boundedness, as the
following lemma shows.
Lemma 5.1. If the normed linear space V is infinite-dimensional, then its
closed unit ball BI = H: II ~II ~ I} cannot be covered by a finite number
of balls of radius -1.
Proof. Since V is not finite-dimensional, we can choose a sequence {an} such
that an+l is not in the linear span M n of {aI, ... , an}, for each n. Since M n is
closed in V, by the corollary of Theorem 4.6, we can apply Lemma 1.5 to find
a vector ~n in M n such that II ~n II = 1 and p( ~n' M n-l) > i for all n > 1.

Ilfnlloo = 1 for all nand Ilfn - fmlloo = 1 if n ¢ m. Thus no ball of radius i can
contain more than one of the functions f n, and accordingly the closed unit ball in
V cannot be covered by a finite number of balls of radius l

Lemma 5.2. Every sequentially compact set A is totally bounded.
Proof. If A is not totally bounded, then there exists an r such that no finite
subset F is r-dense in A. We can then define a sequence {Pn} inductively by
taking PI as any point of A, P2 as any point of A not in Br(PI), and Pn as any
point of A not in Br[U~-l Pi] = U~-l Br(Pi). Then {Pn} is a sequence in A
such that P(Pi' Pj) ~ r for all i ¢ j. But this sequence can have no convergent
subsequence. Thus, if A is not totally bounded, then A is not sequentially compact, proving the lemma. 0
Corollary. A normed linear space V is finite-dimensional if and only if its
closed unit ball is sequentially compact.
Proof. This follows from Theorem 4.4 in one direction and from the above two
lemmas in the other direction. 0
Lemma 5.3. Suppose that A is sequentially compact and that {Ei : i E J}
is an open covering of A (that is, {Ei} is a family of open sets and A C UiEi).
Then there exists an r > 0 with the property that for every point P in A the
ball Br(P) is included in some E j •
Proof. Otherwise, for every r there is a point P in A such that Br(P) is not a subset of any E j • Take r = l/n, with corresponding sequence {Pn}. Thus Bl/n(Pn)
is not a subset of any E j • Since A is sequentially compact, {Pn} has a convergent
subsequence, Pn(m) ~ P as m ~ 00. Since {Ei} covers A, some E j contains p,

and then B.(p) C E j for some E > 0, since E j is open. Taking m large enough so
that l/m < E/2 and also P(Pn(m), p) < E/2, we have

Theorem 5.S. If ff is an open covering of a sequentially compact set A,
then some finite subfamily of ff covers A.

every P in A the ball Br(P) lies entirely in some set of ff, and by the first lemma
there exist Pb ... , Pn in A such that A C U~ Br(Pi). Taking corresponding sets

In general topology, a set A such that every open covering of A includes a
finite covering is said to be compact or to have the Heine-Borel property. Thc
above theorem says that in a metric space every sequentially compact set if:;
compact. We shall see below that the reverse implication also holds, so that thc
two notions are in fact equivalent on a metric space.
Theorem 5.4. If A is a compact metric space, then A is sequentially
compact.
Proof. Let {xn} be any sequence in A, and let ff be the collection of open balls B
such that B contains only finitely many Xi. If ff were to cover A, then by compactness A would be the union of finitely many balls in ff, and this would clearly
imply that the whole of A contains only finitely many Xi, contradicting the fact
that {Xi} is an infinite sequence. Therefore, ff does not cover A, and so there is a
point X in A such that every ball about x contains infinitely many of the Xi.
More precisely, every ball about x contains Xi for infinitely many indices i. It can
now be safely left to the reader to see that a subsequence of {xn} converges to x. 0

6. EQUICONTINUITY

The application of sequential compactness that we shall make in an infinitedimensional context revolves around the notion of an equicontinuou8 family of
functions. If A and B are metric spaces, then a subset fr C BA is said to be
equicontinuou8 at Po in A if all the functions of fr are continuous at Po and if
given E, there is a ~ which works for them all, i.e., such that
p(p, Po)

<

~ => p(j(p),f(Po»

<E

for every fin fr.

The family fr is uniformly equicontinuou8 if ~ is also independent of Po, and so is
dependent only on E. Our quantifier string is thus (VE)(3~)(Vp, qEA)(Vr'.f).
For example, given m > 0, let fr be a collection of functions f from (0, 1) to
(0, 1) such that!' exists and 1f'1 :$ m on (0, 1). Then If(x) - f(y) I :$ mix - yl,
by the ordinary mean-value theorem. Therefore, given any E, we can take
~ = Elm and have
Ix - yl < ~ => If(x) - f(y)1 < E
for all x, y E (0, 1) and all f E fr. The collection fr is thus uniformly equicontinuous.

A and B are totally bounded metric spaces, and if ff is a
uniformly equicontinuou8 subfamily of BA, then fr is totally bounded in the

Proof. Given E > 0, choose 8 so that for allfin 5 and all Pi, P2 in A, P(Pb P2) <
o =? P(J(Pl), f(P2») < E/4. Let D be a finite subset of A which is o-dense in A,
and let E be a finite subset of B which is (E/4)-dense in B. Let G be the set ED of
all functions on D into E. G is of course finite; in fact, #G = n m , where m = #D
and n = #E. Finally, for each g E G let 5 g be the set of all functions f E 5 such
that
p(j(p), g(p») < E/4
for every P E D.

We claim that the collections 5 g cover 5 and that each 5 g has diameter at most E.
We will then obtain a finite E-dense subset of 5 by choosing one function from
each nonempty 5 g , and the theorem will be proved.
To show that every f E 5 is in some 5 g , we simply construct a suitable g.
For each P in D there exists a q in E whose distance from f(p) is less than E/4.
If we choose one such q in E for each pin D, we have a function gin G such that
fE5 g •

The final thing we have to show is that if f, h E 5g , then p(f, h)
p(h, g) < E/4 on D and p(f, g) < E/4 on D, it follows that

Thus every Cauchy sequence in B is convergent and B is complete. 0

in essentially the same way. One additional fact has to be established, namely,
that the limit map (corresponding to g in the above theorem) is linear.
Theorem 7.7. A closed subset of a complete metric space is complete. A

complete subset of any metric space is closed.

Proof. The proof is left to the reader.

It follows from Theorem 7.7 that a complete metric space A is absolutely
closed, in the sense that no matter how we extend A to a larger metric space
B, A is always a closed subset of B. Actually, this property is equivalent to
completeness, for if A is not complete, then a very important construction of
metric space theory shows that A can be completed. That is, we can construct
a complete metric space B which includes A. Now, if A is not complete, then
the closure of A in B, being complete, is different from A, and A is not absolutely
closed.
See Exercise 7.21 through 7.23 for a construction of the completion of a
metric space. The completion of a normed linear space is of course a Banach
space.

Corollary. me(A, W) is a Banach space.
Theorem 7.9. If A is a sequentially compact metric space, then A is com-

plete.
Proof. A Cauchy sequence in A has a subsequence converging to a limit in A,
and therefore, by Lemma 7.2, itself converges to that limit. Thus A is complete. 0

In Section 5 we proved that a compact set is also totally bounded. It can be
shown, conversely, that a complete, totally bounded set A is sequentially compact, so that these two properties together are equivalent to compactness.
The crucial fact is that if A is totally bounded, then every sequence in A
has a Cauchy subsequence. If A is also complete, this Cauchy subsequence will
converge to a point of A. Thus the fact that total boundedness and completeness together are equivalent to compactness follows directly from the next
lemma.
Lemma 7.4. If A is totally bounded, then every sequence in A has a Cauchy

subsequence.
Proof. Let {Pm} be any sequence in A. Since A can be covered by a finite
number of balls of radius 1, at least one ball in such a covering contains infinitely
many of the points {Pm}. More precisely, there exists an infinite set M 1 C z+
such that the set {Pm: m E M I} lies in a single ball of radius 1. Suppose that
M b . . . , M n C Z+ have been defined so that M i + 1 C M;for i = 1, ... ,n - 1,
M n is infinite, and {Pm: m E M i } is a subset of a ball of radius l/i for i = 1, ... ,n.
Since A can be covered by a finite family of balls of radius l/(n 1), at least
one covering ball contains infinitely many points of the set {Pm: mE M n}. More
precisely, there exists an infinite set M n+l C M n such that {Pm: m E M n+l}
is a subset of a ball of radius l/(n 1). We thus define an infinite sequence
{M n} of subsets of Z+ having the above properties.
N ow choose ml E M 1, m2 E M 2 so that m2 > ml, and, in general, mn+l E
Mn+l so that m n+l > m". Then the subsequence {PmJn is Cauchy. For
given E, we can choose n so that l/n < E/2. Then i, j > n ==> mi, mj E M n ==>

Theorem 7.10. A metric space S is sequentially compact if and only if S is
totally bounded and complete.
The next three sections will be devoted to applications of completeness to
the calculus, but before embarking on these vital matters we should say a few
words about infinite series. As in the ordinary calculus, if {~n} is a sequence in a
normed linear space V, we say that the series :E ~i converges and has the sum a,
and write:E~ ~i = a, if the sequence of partial sums converges to a. This means
that Un - t a as n - t ao, where Un is the finite sum :Ei ~i for each n. We say that
:E ~i converges absolutely if the series of norms :E II M converges in IR. This is
abuse of language unless it is true that every absolutely convergent series converges, and the importance of the notion stems from the following theorem.
Theorem 7.11. If V is a Banach space, then every absolutely convergent
series in V is convergent.

Proof. Let:E ~i be absolutely convergent. This means that :E I ~ill converges in
R, i.e., that the sequence {sn} converges in R, where Sn = :Ei II ~ill. If m < n,
then

Since {Si} is Cauchy in R, this inequality shows that {Ui} is Cauchy in V and
therefore, because V is complete, that {un} is convergent in V. That is, :E ~i is
convergent in V. 0
The reader will be asked to show in an exercise that, conversely, if a normed
linear space V is such that every absolutely convergent series converges, then V
is complete. This property therefore characterizes Banach spaces.
We shall make frequent use of the above theorem. For the moment we
note just one corollary, the classical Weierstrass comparison test.
Corollary. If {In} is a sequence of bounded real-valued (or W-valued, for
some Banach space W) functions on a common domain A, and if there is a
sequence {M n} of positive constants such that :E M n is convergent and
IIfnll"" ~ Mn for each n, then :E fn is uniformly convergent.

Proof. The hypotheses imply that :Ellfnll"" converges, and so :E fn converges in
the Banach space CB(A, W) by the theorem. But convergence in CB(A, W) is
uniform convergence. 0

desired completion of S. For each pES, let Op: V ~ IR be "evaluation at p". That is,

choose p and consider the special function I(x) = pep, x) - pep, Po). Show that I is

7.21 Prove that the sum of a uniformly convergent series of infinitesimals (all on the

8. A FIRST LOOK AT BANACH ALGEBRAS

When we were considering the implicit-function theorem and the inverse-function
theorem in· the last chapter, we saw how useful it is to know that if a transformation T has an inverse T- 1 , then so does S whenever liS - Til is small enough,
and that the mapping T 1-+ T- 1 is continuous on the open set of all invertible
elements. When the spaces in question are finite-dimensional, these facts can
be made to follow from the continuity of the determinant function T 1-+ /leT)
from Hom V to IR. It is also possible to produce them by arguing directly in
terms of upper and lower bounds for T and its close approximations S. But the
most natural, most elegant,. and-in the case of Banach spaces-easiest way to
prove these things is to show that if V is a Banach space and T in Hom V has
norm less than one, then the sum of the geometric series :EO' Tn is the inverse of
I - T, just as in the elementary calculus. But in making this argument, the
fact that T is a linear transformation has little importance, and we shall digress
for a moment to explore this situation.
Ust us summarize the norm and algebraic properties of Hom V when V is a
Banach space. First of all, we know that Hom V is also a Banach space. Second,
it is an algebra. That is, it possesses an associative mUltiplication operation
(composition) that relates to the linear operations according to the following
laws:
S(TI
(SI

+ T 2) = ST + ST2,
1

+ S2)T =

SIT + S2T,
c(ST) = (cS)T = S(cT).

Finally, multiplication is related to the norm by

IISTII 5 IISII II Til

and

11111 = 1.

This list of properties constitutes exactly the axioms for a Banach algebra.
Just as we can see certain properties of functions most clearly by forgetting
that they are functions and considering them only as elements of a vector space,
now it turns out that we can treat certain properties of transformations in
Hom(V) most simply by forgetting the complicated nature of a linear transformation and considering it merely as an element of an abstract Banach algebra.A.

The most important simple thing we can do in a Banach algebra that we
couldn't do in a Banach space is to consider power series. The following theorem
shows that the geometric series, in particular, plays the same central role here
that it plays in elementary calculus. Since we are not thinking of the elements of
A as transformations, we shall designate them by lower-case letters; e is the
identity of A.

A FIRST LOOK AT BANACH ALGEBRAS

We saw above that the map x 1-+ (e - X)-l from the open unit ball B1(O) in
a Banach algebra A to A is the sum of the geometric power series. We can define
many other mappings by convergent power series, at hardly any greater effort.
Theorem 8.3. Let A be a Banach algebra. Let the sequence {an} C A and
the positive number ~ be such that the sequence {llanll ~n} is bounded. Then
L anx n converges for x in the ball Ba(O) in A, and if 0 < s < ~,then the
series converges uniformly on B8(O).

Proof. Set r = s/~, and let b be a bound for the sequence {llanll ~n}. On the
ball Bs(O) we then have Ilanxnll ::; Ilanlls n = Ilanll ~nrn ::; br n, and the series
therefore converges uniformly on this ball by comparison with the geometric
series bL rn, since 1" < 1. 0
The series of most interest to us will have real coefficients. They are included
in the above argument because the product of the vector x and the scalar t is
the algebra product (te)x. In addition to dealing with the above geometric series,
we shall be particularly interested in the exponential function eX =
xn In!.
The usual comparison arguments of the elementary calculus show just as easily
here that this series converges for every x in A and uniformly on any ball.
It is natural to consider the differentiability of the maps from A to A defined
by such convergent series, and we state the basic facts below, starting with a
fundamental theorem on the differentiability of a limit of a sequence.

Theorem 8.4. Let {Fn} be a sequence of maps from a ball B in a normed

a. Then F is differentiable on Band dF {J = lim dF~ for each {3 in B.

commutative Banach algebra. The function x ~ eX =

just as easily on any Banach algebra A, but it is not nearly as pleasant when A
is noncommutative. However, one thing that we can always do, and often
thereby save the day, is to restrict the exponential mapping to a commutative
subalgebra of A, say that generated by a single element x. For example, we can
consider the parametrized arc 'Y(t) = etx (x fixed) into any Banach algebra A,

9. THE CONTRACTION MAPPING FIXED-POINT THEOREM

In this section we shall prove the very simple and elegant fixed-point theorem for
contraction mappings, and then shall use it to complete the proof of the implicitfunction theorem. Later, in Chapter 6, it will be the basis of our proof of the
fundamental existence and uniqueness theorem for ordinary differential equations. The section concludes with a comparison of the iterative procedure of the
fixed-point theorem and that of Newton's method.

4.9

THE CONTRACTION MAPPING FIXED-POINT THEOREM

229

A mapping K from a metric space X to itself is a contraction if it is a Lipschitz
mapping with constant less than 1; that is, if there is a constant C with 0 < C < 1
such that p(K(x), K(y)) ~ Cp(x, y) for all x, y EX. A fixed point of K is, of
course, a point x such that K(x) = x.
A contraction K can have at most one fixed point, since if K(x) = x and
K(y) = y, thenp(x, y) = p(K(x), K(y)) ~ Cp(x, y), and so (1 - C)p(x, y) ~ O.
Since C < 1, this implies that p(x, y) = 0 and x = y.
Theorem 9.1. Let X

K: X -

be a nonempty complete metric space, and let

X be a contraction. Then K has a (unique) fixed point.

Proof. Choose any Xo in X, and define the sequence {x n } 0inductively by setting
Xl = K(xo), X2 = K(Xl) = K2(XO)' and Xn = K(Xn_l) = Kn(xo). Set 6 =
P(Xh xo). Thenp(x2, Xl) = P(K(Xl), K(xo)) ~ Cp(Xl, xo) = C6, and, by induc-

tion,
p(xn+l> x n ) = p(K(x n), K(Xn_l)) ~ Cp(xn> Xn-l) ~ C· cn-l 6 = C n 6.
It follows that {x n } is Cauchy, for if m

C i6

< C n6/(1

- C),

and C n _ 0 as n - 00, because C < 1. Since X is complete, {xn} converges to
some a in X, and it then follows that K(a) = lim K(xn) = lim Xn+l = a, so
that a is a fixed point. 0

In practice, we meet mappings K that are contractions only near some
particular point p, and we have to establish that a suitable neighborhood of p
is carried into itself by K. We show below that if K is a contraction on a ball
about p, and if K doesn't move the center of p very far, then the theorem can
be applied.
Corollary 1. Let D be a closed ball in a complete metric space X, and let

X be a contraction which moves the center of D a distance at
most (1 - C)r, where r is the radius of D and C is the contraction constant.
Then K has a unique fixed point and it is in D.
K: D -

Proof. We simply check that the range of K is actually in D. If p is the center
of D and X is any point in D, then

p(K(p), p)
~ Cp(x, p)

Corollary 2. Let B be an open ball in a complete metric space X, and let
K: B - X be a contraction which moves the center of B a distance less than
(1 - C)r, where r is the radius of Band C is the contraction constant.
Then K has a unique fixed point.

Proof. Restrict K to any slightly smaller closed ball D concentric with B, and
apply the above corollary. 0

COMPACTNESS AND COMPLETENESS

Corollary 3. Let K be a contraction on the complete metric space X, and
suppose that K moves the point x a distance d. Then the distance from x to
the fixed point is at most dl(1 - C), where C is the contraction constant.

Proof. Let D be the closed ball about x of radius r = dl(1 - C), and apply
Corollary 1 to the restriction of K to D. It implies that the fixed point is in D. 0

We now suppose that the contraction K contains a parameter s, so that K
is now a function of two variables K(s, x). We shall assume that K is a contraction in x uniformly over s, which means that peKes, x), K(s, y)
Cp(x, y)
for all x, y, and s, where 0 < C < 1. We shall also assume that K is a continuous function of s for each fixed x.

s

Corollary 4. Let K be a mapping from S X X to X, where X is a complete
metric space and S is any metric space, and suppose that K(s, x) is a contraction in x uniformly over s and is continuous in s for each x. Then the
fixed point P. is a continuous function of s.

Proof. Given

f, we use the continuity of K in its first variable around the point
to choose 5, so that if pes, t) < 5, then the distance from K(s, PI) to
K(t, Pt) is at most f. Since K(t, PI) = Pt, this simply says that the contraction
with parameter value 8 moves PI a distance at most f, and so the distance from
PI to the fixed point P. is at most f/(1 - C) by Corollary 3. That is, pes, t) <
5 ~ p(P., Pt) < f/(1 - C), where C is the uniform contraction constant, and
the mapping s 1--+ P. is accordingly continuous at t. 0

-< t, PI >-

Combining Corollaries 2 and 4, we have the following theorem.
Theorem 9.2. Let B be a ball in a complete metric space X, let S be any
metric space, and let K be a mapping from S X B to X which is a contraction

in its second variable uniformly over its first variable and is continuous in its
first variable for each value of its second variable. Suppose also that K
moves the center of B a distance less than (1 - C)r for every s in S, where r
is the radius of Band C is the uniform contraction constant. Then for each s
in S there is a unique P in B such that K(s, p) = p, and the mapping
s 1--+ P is continuous from S to B.
We can now complete the proof of the implicit-function theorem.
Theorem 9.3. Let V, W, and X be Banach spaces, let A X B be an open
subset of V X W, and let G: A X B - X be continuous and have a continuous second partial differential. Suppose that the point -< ex, f3 >- in
A X B is such that G(ex, (3) = 0 and dG"<.a..fJ> is invertible. Then there are
open balls M and N about ex and f3, respectively, such that for each ~ in M
there is a unique." in N satisfying G(~, .,,) = O. The function F thus
uniquely defined near -< ex, f3 >- by the condition G(~, F(~) = 0 is continuous.

Proof. Set T = dG"<.a..fJ> and K(~,.,,) = ." - T-l(G(~, .,,). Then K is a continuous mapping from A X B to W such that K(ex, (3) = f3, and K has a con-

4.9

THE CONTRACTION MAPPING FIXED-POINT THEOREM

231

tinuous second partial differential such that dK~a,(j> = 0. Because dK~p,.> is
a continuous function of -<p., v>-, we can choose a product ball 111 X N about
-< a, (3 >- on which dK~p,.> is bounded by!, and we can then decrease the ball M
if necessary so that for p. in M we also have IIK(p., (3) - (311 < 1"/2, where l' is the
radius of the ball N. The mean-value theorem for differentials implies that K is
a contraction in its second variable with constant t. The preceding theorem
therefore shows that for each ~ in M there is a unique." in N such that K(t, .,,) =
." and the mapping F: ~ 1-+ ." is continuous. Since K(~, .,,) = ." if and only if
G(~, .,,) = 0, we are done. 0
Theorems 8.2 and 9.3 complete the list of ingredients of the implicit-function
theorem. (However, see Exercise 9.8.)
We next show, in the other direction, that if a contraction depending on a
parameter is continuously differentiable, then the fixed point is a continuously
differentiable function of the parameter.
Theorem 9.4. Let V and W be Banach spaces, and let K be a differentiable
mapping from an open subset A X B of V X W to W which satisfies the
hypotheses of Theorem 9.2. Then the function F from A to B uniquely
defined by the equation K(~, F(~)) = F(~) is differentiable.

Proof. The inequality IIK(~, .,,') - K(~, .,,")11 ~ Gil.,,' - .,,"11 is equivalent to
IldK~a,(j>11 ~ G for all -<a, (3>- in A X B. We now define G by G(~, .,,) =
." - K(~, .,,), and observe that dG 2 = 1 - dK 2 and that dG 2 is therefore
invertible by Theorem 8.1. Since G(~, F(~)) = 0, it follows from Theorem 11.1
of Chapter 3 that F is differentiable and that its differential is obtained by
differentiating the above equation. 0
Corollary. If K is continuously differentiable, then so is F.

* We should emphasize that the fixed-point theorem not only has the implicitfunction theorem as a consequence, but the proof of the fixed-point theorem
gives an iterative procedure for actually finding the value of F(~), once we
know how to compute T- 1 (where T = dG~a,(j». In fact, for a given value of
~ in a small enough ball about -< a, (3 >- consider the function G(~, .). If we
set K(~, .,,) = ." - T-IG(~, .,,), then the inductive procedure

"'i+I

becomes
(9.1)

The meaning of this iterative procedure is easily seen by studying the graph of
the situation where V = W = RI. (See Fig. 4.4.) As was proved above, under
suitable hypotheses, the series EII"'i+l - "'ill converges geometrically.
It is instructive to compare this procedure with Newton's method of elementary calculus. There the iterative scheme (9.1) is replaced by

linear transformations Si.

Let us suppress the ~ which will be fixed in the argument and consider a map

We end this section with an example of the fixed-point iterative procedure in

the equation H(1/) - ~ = 0 for 1/ in terms of~. Our theory above tells us that

that in forming K(~, .,,) = ." - T-IG(~, .,,), we have acted to make dK 2 = 0 at

10. THE INTEGRAL OF A PARAMETRIZED ARC

In this section we shall make our final application of completeness. We first,
prove a very general extension theorem, and then apply it to the construction of
the Riemann integral as an extension of an elementary integral defined for step
functions.
TheoreD1 10.1. Let U be a subspace of a normed linear space V, and let 7'

be a bounded linear mapping from U to a Banach space W. Then T has a
uniquely determined extension to a bounded linear transformation 8 from
the closure D to W. Moreover, 11811 = IITII.

ProoJ. Fix a E D and choose {~n} C U so that ~n -+ a. Then {~n} is Cauchy and
{T(~n)} is Cauchy (by the lemmas of Section 7), so that {T(~n)} converges to some (3 E W. If {lIn} is any other sequence in U converging to a,
then ~n - lIn -+ 0, T(~n) - T(lIn) = T(~n - lIn) -+ 0, and so T(lIn) -+ {3 also.
Thus {3 is independent of the sequence chosen, and, clearly, (3 must be the valuc
8(a) at a of any continuous extension 8 of T. If a E U, then (3 = lim T(a n) =
T(a) by the continuity of T. We thus have 8 uniquely defined on D by the
requirement that it be a continuous extension of T.
I t remains to be shown that 8 is linear and bounded by II Til. For any a, {3 E D
we choose {~n}, {lIn} C U, so that ~n -+ a and lIn -+ (3. Then x~n + YlIn -+
x~ + YlI, so that

8(xa

+ y(3) =

lim

T(x~n

+ YlIn) =

x lim

T(~n)

+ Y lim T(lIn) =

x8(a)

+ y8({3).

Thus 8 is linear. Finally,
118(a)11 = lim IIT(~n)11 ~ IITlllim II~nll = !ITII· Ilall·
Thus II Til is a bound for 8, and, since 8 includes T, 11811

= II Til. 0

The above theorem has many applications, but we shall use it only once, to
obtain the Riemann integral f: J(t) dt of a continuous function J mapping a
closed interval [a, b] into a Banach space Was an extension of the trivial integral
for step functions. If W is a normed linear space and J: [a, b] -+ W is a continuous function defined on a closed interval [a, b] C IR, we might expect to be
able to define f: J(t) dt as a suitable vector in Wand to proceed with the integral
calculus of vector-valued functions of one real variable. We haven't done this
until now because we need the completeness of W to prove that the integral
exists!
At first we shall integrate only certain elementary functions called step
functions. A finite subset A of [a, b] which contains the two endpoints a and b

4.10

THE INTEGRAL OF A PARAMETRIZED AHC

237

will be called a partition of [a, b). Thus A is (the range of) some finite sequence
{ti}o,wherea= to < tl < ... < tn = b,andAsubdivides[a, b) into a sequence
of smaller intervals. To be definite, we shall take the open intervals (ti-b ti),
i = 1, ... , n, as the intervals of the subdivision. If A and B are partitions and
A C B, we shall say that B is a j·efinement of A. Then each interval (Sj-b Sj) of
the B-subdivision is included in an interval (ti-b ti) of the A-subdivision; ti-l
is the largest element of A which is less than or equal to Sj-b and ti is the smallest
greater than or equal to Sj. A step function is simply a map f: [a, b) ---t W which
is constant on the intervals of some subdivision A = {t i} 0· That is, thE'J'e exists
a sequence of vectors {aiH such that f(~) = ai when ~ E (ii-b ti). The values
of f at the subdividing points may be among these values or they may be different.
For each step function f we define f: f(t) dt as Li'= 1 ai Ilti, where f = ai on
(t;-b ti) and Ilti = ti - ti_l. If f were real-valued, this would be simply the
sum of the areas of the rectangles making up the region between the graph of f
and the t-axis. Now f may be described as a step function in terms of many
different subdivisions. For example, if f is constant on the intervals of A, and
if we obtain B from A by adding one new point s, then f is constant on the
(smaller) intervals of B. We have to be sure that the value of the integral of f
doesn't change when we change the describing subdivision. In the case just
mentioned this is easy to see. The one new point slies in some interval (ti-l, ti),
defined by the partition A. The contribution of this interval to the A-sum is
ai(ti - ti_l), while in the B-sum it splits into ai(ti - s)
ai(s - ti_l). But
this is the same vector. The remaining summands are the same in the two sums,
and the integral is therefore unchanged. In general, suppose that f is a step
function with respect to A and also with respect to C. Set B = A U C, the
"common refinement" of A and C. We can pass from A to B in a sequence of
steps at each of which we add one new point. As we have seen, the integral
remains unchanged at each of these steps, and so it is the same for A as for B.
It is similarly the same for C and B, and so for A and C. We have thus shown
that f: f is independent of the subdivision used to define f.
Now fix [a, b) and W, and let e be the set of all step functions from [a, b)
to W. Then e is a vector space. For, if f and gin e are step functions relative to
partitions A and B, then both functions are constant on the intervals of C =
A u B, and therefore xf yg is also. Moreover, if C = {ti} 0, and if on (ti-b ti)
we havef = ai and g = (3;, so that xf yg = xai y{3i there, then the equation

+

is just f: (xf + yg) = x
W. Finally,

f: f + y f: g.

where !!fll"" = lub {!!f(t)!! : t E [a, b]} = max {!!ai!! : 1 ~ i ~ n}. That is, if
we use on S the uniform norm defined from the norm of W, then the linear
mapping I ~ f; f is bounded by (b - a). If W is complete, this transformation
therefore has a unique bounded linear extension to the closure S of S in
(B([a, b], W) by Theorem 10.1. But we can show that S includes the space
e([a, b], W) of all continuous functions from [a, b] to W, and the integral of a
continuous function is thus uniquely defined.

That is, given E>o, there exists 15>0 such that !s - tl < 15 => IIf(s) - I(t) II < E.
Now take any partition A = {ti} 0on [a, b] such that Ati = ti - ti-l < 15 for all
i, and take ai as any value of f on (ti-l, ti). Then IIf(t) - aill < E on [ti-b tJ
Thus, if g is the step function with value ai on (ti-l, til and g(a) = aI, then
IIf - gil"" ~ E. Thus f is in S, as desired. 0

Our main theorem is a recapitulation.
Theorem 10.2. If W is a Banach space and V = e([a, b], W) under the
uniform norm, then there exists a J E Hom(V, W) uniquely determined by
setting J(f) = lim fn, where Un} is any sequence in S converging to f

feb f. This same identity then follows for any
continuous function f on [a, b], since f; I = lim f; In = lim (f: In

THE COMPLEX NUMBER SYSTEM

The complex number system C is the third basic number field that must be
studied, after the rational numbers and the real numbers, and the reader surely
has had some contact with it in the past.
Almost everybody views a complex number ~ as being equivalent to a pair
of real numbers, the "real and imaginary parts" of ~, and the complex number
system C is thus viewed as being Cartesian 2-space ~ 2 with some further struc-

4.11

THE COMPLEX NUMBER SYSTEM

241

ture. In particular, a complex-valued function is simply a certain kind of vectorvalued function, and is equivalent to an ordered pair of real-valued functions,
again its real and imaginary parts.
What distinguishes the complex number system C from its vector substratum
1R2 is the presence of an additional operation, complex multiplication. The
vector operations of 1R2 together with this complex multiplication operation
make C into a commutative algebra. Moreover, it turns out that -< 1, 0>- is the
unique multiplicative identity in C and that every nonzero complex number ~
has a multiplicative inverse. These additional facts are summarized by saying
that C is a field, and they allow us to use C as a new scalar field in vector space
theory. In fact, the whole development of Chapters 1 and 2 remains valid when
IR is replaced everywhere by Co Scalar multiplication is now multiplication by
complex numbers. Thus c n is the vector space of ordered n-tuples of complex
numbers -< ~l! ... , ~n >-, and the product of an n-tuple by a complex scalar ex.
is defined by ex.-< ~l! ... ' ~n>- = -<ex.~l! ... ' ex.~n>-' where ex.~i is complex
multiplication.
It is time to come to grips with complex multiplication. As the reader probably knows, it is given by an odd looking formula that is motivated by thinking
of an element ~ = -<Xl! X2>- as being in the form Xl + iX2' where i 2 = -1,
and then using the ordinary laws of algebra. Then we have
~."

+ ix 2)(YI + iY2)
= XIYI + iXIY2 + iX2YI + i2X2Y2 =
=

(Xl

(XIYI -

X2Y2)

+ i(XIY2 + X2Yl),

and thus our definition is

-< Xl, X2>- -< YI, Y2>- = -< XIYI

-

X2Y2, XIY2

+ X2YI >-.

Of course, it has to be verified that this operation is commutative and satisfies
the laws for an algebra. A straightforward check is possible but dull, and we
shall indicate a neater way in the exercises.
The mapping X ~ -< X, 0>- is an isomorphic injection of the field IR into the
field C. It clearly preserves sums, and the reader can check in his mind that it
also preserves products. It is conventional to identify X with its image -< x, 0>- ,
and so to view IR as a subfield of C.
The mysterious i can be identified in C as the pair -< 0, 1>-, since then
i 2 = -<0,1>- -<0,1>- = -< -1,0>-, which we have identified with -1. With
these identifications we have -< x, y>- = -< X, 0>- + -< 0, y>- = -< X, 0>- +
-< 0, 1>- -< y, 0>- = X + iy, and this is the way we shall write complex numbers
from now on.
The mapping X + iy ~ X - iy is a field isomorphism of C with itself.
That is, it preserves both sums and products, as the reader can easily check.
Such a self-isomorphism is called an automorphism. The above automorphism is
called complex conjugation, and the image X - iy of r = X + iy is called the
conjugate of r, and is designated
We shall ask the reader to show in an exercise

r.

242

4.11

COMPACTNESS AND COMPLETENESS

that conjugation is the only automorphism of C (except the identity automorphism) which leaves the elements of the subfield IR fixed.
The Euclidean norm of r = x
iy = -< x, y>- is called the absolute value
of r, and is designated Irl, so that Irl = Ix
iyl = (x 2 y2)1/2. This is
reasonable beeause it then turns out that Ipl = Irll'Yl. This can be verified by
squaring and multiplying, but it is much more elegant first to notice the relationship between absolute value and the conjugation automorphism, namely,

+

+

+

rf = Irl 2
[(x+iy)(x - iy) = x 2 - (iy) 2= X 2 +y2]. Then Ipl2 = (p)(p) = (rf)('Y'Y) =
IrI 21'Y1 2, and taking square roots gives us our identity. The identity rf = Irl 2
also shows us that if r ~ 0, then fll rl 2is its multiplicative inverse.
Because the real number system IR is a subfield of the complex number
system C, any vector space over C is automatically also a vector space over IR:
multiplication by complex scalars includes multiplication by real scalars. And
any complex linear transformation between complex vector spaces is automatically real linear. The converse, of course, does not hold. For example, a
real linear mapping T from 1R2 to 1R2 is not in general complex linear from C to C,
nor does a real linear S in Hom 1R4 become a complex linear mapping in Hom C 2
when 1R4 is viewed as C 2 • We shall study this question in the exercises.
The complex differentiability of a mapping F between complex vector spaces
has the obvious definition llF", = T
where T is complex linear, and then
F is also real differentiable, in view of the above remarks. But F may be real
differentiable without being complex differentiable. It follows from the discussion at the end of Section 8 that if {an} C C and {la n I5 n} is bounded, then the
series L anr n converges on the ball Ba(O) in the (real) Banach algebra C, and
F(r) = La anr n is real differentiable on this ball, with dFIl(r) = (L~ na n(3n)r =
F'«(3) . r But multiplication by F'«(3) is obviously a complex linear operation
on the one-dimensional complex vector space Co Therefore, complex-valued
functions defined by convergent complex power series are automatically complex differentiable. But we can go even further. In this case, if r ~ 0, we can
divide by r in the defining equation

+ ('),

to get the result that

llFIlW ~ F'«(3)

r

as

r~o.

That is, F'«(3) is now an honest derivative again, with the complex infinitesimal r
in the denominator of the difference quotient.
The consequences of complex differentiability are incalculable, and we shall
mostly leave them as future pleasures to be experienced in a course on functions
of complex variables. See, however, the problems on the residue calculus at the
end of Chapter 12 and the proof in Chapter 11, Exercise 4.3, of the following
fundamental theorem of algebra.

Theorem. Every polynomial with complex coefficients is a product of
linear factors.
A weaker but equivalent statement is that every polynomial has at least one
(complex) root. The crux of the matter is that x 2
1 cannot be factored over jR
(i.e., it has no real root), but over C we have x 2
1 = (x
i)(x -- i), with the
two roots ± i.
For later use we add a few more words about the complex exponential function exp r = ei = LO' rn/n!. If r = x
iy, we have ei = ex + ill = eXeill , and
ei1l = LO' (iy)n/n! = (1 - y2/2! +y4/4! - ... ) +i(y - y3/3!+ yS/5! - ... ) =
cos y i sin y. Thus ex + i1l = eX(cos y i sin y). That is, the real and imaginary
parts of the complex-valued function exp (x
iy) are eX cos y and eX sin y,
respectively.

*12. WEAK METHODS

Our theorem that all norms are equivalent on a finite-dimensional space suggests
that the limit theory of such spaces should be accessible independently of norms,
and our earlier theorem that every linear transformation with a finite-dimensional domain is automatically bounded reinforces this impression. We shall look
into this question in this section. In a sense this effort is irrelevant, since we
can't do without norms completely, and since they are so handy that we use
them even when we don't have to.
Roughly speaking, what we are going to do is to study a vector-valued map F
by studying the whole collection of real-valued maps (l 0 F : 1 E V*) .
Theorem 12.1. If V is finite-dimensional, then ~n ~ ~ in V (with respect to
any, and so every, norm) if and only if lan) ~ l(~) in IR for each 1 in V*.
Proof. If ~n ~ ~ and 1 E V*, then l(~n) ~ l(~), since 1 is automatically continuous. Conversely, if l(~n) ~ l(~) for every 1 in V*, then, choosing a basis
{tli}~ for V, we have Ei(~n) ~ Ei(~) for each functional Ei in the dual basis, and
this implies that ~n ~ ~ in the associated one-norm, since I! ~n - ~!! 1 =
L~ IEi(~n) - Ei(~)1 ~ o. 0
Remark. If V is an arbitrary normed linear space, so that V* = Hom(V, IR)
is the set of bounded linear functionals, then we say that ~n ~ ~ weakly if
l(~n) ~ l(~) for each 1 E V*. The above theorem can therefore be rephrased to
Ray that in a finite-dimensional space, weak convergence and norm convergence are
equivalent notions.

We shall now see that in a similar way the integration and differentiation of
parametrized arcs can all be thrown back to the standard calculus of real-valued
functions of a real variable by applying functionals from V* and using the
natural isomorphism of V** with V. Thus, if f E e([a, b], V) and X E V*, then

Similarly, if all the real-valued functions {A 0 f: A E V*} are differentiahll'

in the standard calculus:

N ow the fundamental theorem of the calculus appears as follows.
If F(x) =
f, then (A 0 F)(x) =
A 0 f by the weak definition of tlw
integral. The fundamental theorem of the standard calculus then says thai
(A 0 F)' exists and (A 0 F)'(x) = (A 0 f) (x) = A(j(X)). By the weak definition 01
the derivative we then have that F' exists and F'(x) = f(x).
The one conclusion that we don't get so easily by weak methods is the nOflll

(z, w) = L1 Z.Wi when V = en and (f, g) =
jg when V is the space of
continuous complex-valued functions on [a, b]. We shall study only the real case.
It follows from (a) and (b) that a semiscalar product is also linear in the
second variable when the first variable is held fixed, and therefore is a symmetric
bilinear functional whose associated quadratic form q(~) = (~, ~) is positive
definite or positive semidefinite [(c) or (c /); see the last section in Chapter 2].
The definiteness of the form q has far-reaching consequences, as we shall begin
to see at once.

Theorem 1.1. The Schwarz inequality
I(~,

is valid for any semiscalar product.

Proof. We have 0 ~ (~ - t1], ~ - t1]) = (~, ~) - 2t(~, 1])

+ t 2 (1], 1]) for every

t E~. Since this quadratic in t is never negative, it cannot have distinct roots,
and the usual (b 2 - 4ac)-formula implies that 4(~, 1])2 - 4(~, ~)(1], 1]) ~ 0,
which is equivalent to the Schwarz inequality. 0
We can also proceed directly. If (1], 1]) > 0, and if we set t = (~, 1])/(1], 1])
in the quadratic inequality in the first line of the proof, then the resulting
expression simplifies to the Schwarz inequality. If (1], 1]) = 0, then (~, 1]) must
also be 0 (or else the beginning inequality is clearly false for some t), and now
the Schwarz inequality holds trivially.

Note that the Schwarz inequality I(~, 1])1 ~ 1I~1I111]11 is now just the statement that the bilinear functional (~, 1]) is bounded by one with respect to the
scalar product norm.
A normed linear space V in which the norm is a scalar product norm is
called a pre-Hilbert space. If V is complete in this norm, it is a Hilbert space.

5.1

SCALAR PRODUCT SPACES

The two examples of scalar products mentioned earlier give us the real explanation of our two-norms for the first time:
n

\lxl12 = ( ~ x~

)1/2

for

x E IR n

and
for

IE e([a, b])

are scalar product norms.
Since the scalar product norm on IR n becomes Euclidean length under a
Cartesian coordinate correspondence with Euclidean n-space, it is conventional
to call IR n itself Euclidean n-space IP when we want it understood that thp
scalar product norm is being used.
Any finite-dimensional space V is a Hilbert space with respect to any scalar
product norm, because its finite dimensionality guarantees its completeness.
On the other hand, we shall see in Exercise 1.10 that e([a, b]) is incomplete in th('
two-norm, and is therefore a pre-Hilbert space but not a Hilbert space in this
norm. (Remember, however, that e([a, b]) is complete in the uniform norm
11111",.) It is important to the real uses of Hilbert spaces in mathematics that any
pre-Hilbert space can be completed to a Hilbert space, but the theory of infinitedimensional Hilbert spaces is for the most part beyond the scope of this book.
Scalar product norms have in some sense the smoothest possible unit
spheres, because these spheres are quadratic surfaces.
It is orthogonality that gives the theory of pre-Hilbert spaces its special
flavor. Two vectors a and fJ are said to be orthogonal, written a 1- fJ, if (a, fJ) = O.
This definition gets its inspiration from geometry; we noted in Chapter 1 that
two geometric vectors are perpendicular if and only if their coordinate triples x
and y satisfy (x, y) = O. It is an interesting problem to go further and to show
from the law of cosines (c 2 = a 2 b2 - 2ab cos (J) that the angle (J between two
geometric vectors is given by (x, y) = Ilxllllyll cos (J. This would motivate us
to define the angle (J between two vectors ~ and 'I] in a pre-Hilbert space by
(~, '1]) = II ~IIII'I]II cos (J, but we shall have no use for this more general formulation.
We say that two subsets A and B are orthogonal, and we write A 1- B, if
a 1- fJ for every a in A and fJ in B; for any subset A we set A 1- = {fJ E V: fJ 1- A J .

+

Lemma 1.1. If fJ is orthogonal to the set A, then fJ is orthogonal to L(A), tlw

closure of the linear span of A. It follows that B1- is a closed subspace for
every subset B.
Proof. The first assertion depends on the linearity and continuity of the scalar
product in one of its variables; it will be left to the reader. As for A = B1-, it
includes the closure of its own linear span, by the first part, and so is a closed
subspace. 0

left and noticing that all "mixed terms" drop out by orthogonality. 0

2. ORTHOGONAL PROJECTION

One of the most important devices in geometric reasoning is "dropping a perpendicular" from a point to a line or a plane and then using right triangh·
arguments. This device is equally important in pre-Hilbert space theory. If M
is a subspace and a is any element in V, then by "the foot of the perpendicular
dropped from a to M" we mean that vector J.L in M such that (a - J.L) 1- 111,
if such a J.L exists. (See Fig. 5.1.) Writing a as J.L + (a - J.L), we see that tllP
existence of the "foot" J.L in JIll for each a in V is equivalent to the direct sum decomposition V = M $ M 1-.
N ow it is precisely this direct sum decomposition
that the completeness of a Hilbert space guarantees,
as we shall shortly see. We start by proving the
geometrically intuitive fact that J.L is the foot of the
111
perpendicular dropped from a to M if and only if J.L
t
I ig.5.1
is the point in M closest to a.
Lemma 2.1. If J.L is in the subspace M, then (a - J.L) 1- M if and only' if J.L is
the unique point in M closest to a, that is, J.L is the "best approximation" to
a in M.

Therefore, (a - JJ.) .1. M. 0

On the basis of this lemma it is clear that a way to look for JJ. is to take a
sequence JJ.n in M such that Iia - JJ.nll --t p(a, M) and to hope to define JJ. as its
limit. Here is the crux of the matter: We can prove that such a sequence {JJ.n} is
always Cauchy, but its limit may not exist if M is not complete!
Lemma 2.2. If {JJ.n} is a sequence in the subspace M whose distance from
some vector a converges to the distance p from a to M, then {JJ.n} is Cauchy.

Proof. By the parallelogram law, IIJJ.n - JJ.m11 2 = II(a - JJ.n) - (a - JJ.m)112 =
2(lla - JJ.n11 2 Iia - JJ.mI1 2) - 112a - (JJ.n
JJ.m)112. Since the first term on the
right converges to 4p2 as n, m --t 00, and since the second term is always

Theorem 2.1. If M is a complete subspace of a pre-Hilbert space V, then

If V = M ED M-L, then the projection on M along Ml. is called the orthogonal
projection on M, or simply the projection on M, since among all the projections on
M associated with the various complements of M, the orthogonal projection is
distinguished. Thus, if M is a complete subspace of V, and if P is the projection
on M, then P(~) is at once the foot of the perpendicular dropped from ~ to M
(which is where the word "projection" comes from) and also the best approximation to ~ in M (Lemma 2.1).
Lemma 2.3. If {MiH is a finite collection of complete, pairwise orthogonal

subspaces, and if for a vector a in V, ai is the projection of a on "Ali for

sufficient to show it orthogonal to each M j separately. But if ~ E Mj, then
(a - L~ ai, ~) = (a - aj, ~), since (ai, ~) = 0 for i ~ j, and (a - aj, ~) = 0
because aj is the projection of a on M j. Thus (a - L~ ai, ~) = O. 0

If an orthogonal set of vectors {'Pi} is also normalized (lI'Pill = 1), then we
call the set orthonormal.

Proof. Let M be the closure of the linear span of {lPi}~. Since V = M
M.l.,
and since M.l. = {lPi}.l., by Lemma 1.1, we see that {lPi}.l. = {o} if and only if
V = M, and, by the theorem, this holds if and only if {lPi} is a basis. 0

Note that when orthogonal bases only are being used, the coefficient of a
vector ~ at a basis element {3 is always the Fourier coefficient (~, (3)/11{3112.
Thus the {3-coefficient of ~ depends only on {3 and is independent of the choice
of the rest of the basis. However, we know from Chapter 2 that when an arbitrary basis containing {3 is being used, then the {3-coefficient of ~ varies with the
basis. This partly explains the favored position of orthogonal bases.
We often obtain an orthonormal sequence by "orthogonalizing" some given
sequence.
Lemma 2.5. If {ai} is a finite or infinite sequence of independent vectors,
then there is an orthonormal sequence {lPi} such that {ai}! and {lPi}'~,have
the same linear span for all n.
Proof. Since normalizing is trivial, we shall only orthogonalize. Suppose, to be
definite, that the sequence is infinite, and let M n be the linear span of
{aI, ... , an}. Let JLn be the orthogonal projection of an on M n-l, and set
IPn = an - JLn (and IPI = al). This is our sequence. We halVe lPi E Mi C M n-l
if i < n, and IPn 1. M n-l, so that the vectors lPi are mutually orthogonal.
Also, IPn ~ 0, since an is not in M n _ l . Thus {lPi}! is an independent subset of
the n-dimensional vector space M n, by the corollary of Lemma 1.2, and so
{lPi}! spans Mn. 0

The actual calculation of the orthogonalized sequence {lPn} can be carried
out recursively, starting with IPI = ab by noticing that since JLn is the projection
of an on the span of IPI, ... , IPn-b it must be the vector L:~-l CilPi, where ci.is
the Fourier coefficient of an with respect to lPi.
Consider, for example, the sequence {xn} 0' in e([O, 1]). We have IPI =
al = 1. Next, 1P2 = a2 - JL2 = X - c· 1, where
C = (a2, IPI)/[IIPI[[2 = fol x·

Thus the first three terms in the orthogonalization of {xn} 0' in e([O, 1]) are 1,

isomorphism. But we have a much more startling result:
Theorem 2.4. () is an isomorphism if and only if V is a Hilbert space.
Proof. Suppose first that V is a Hilbert space. We have to show that () is surjective, i.e., that every nonzero F in V* is of the form ()p. Given such an F, let N
be its null space, let a be a vector orthogonal to N (Theorem 2.1), and consider
(3 = ca, where c is to be determined later. Every vector ~ in V is uniquely a sum
~ = x{3 + 1/, where 1/ is in N. [This only says that V IN is one-dimensional, which
presumably we know, but we can check it directly by applying F and seeing that
F(~ - x(3) = 0 if and only if x = FWIF({3).J But now the equations

3. SELF-ADJOINT TRANSFORMATIONS
Definition. If V is a pre-Hilbert space, then T in Hom V is self-adjoint if
(Ta, (3) = (a, T(3) for every a, {3 E V. The set of all self-adjoint transforma-

tions will be designated SA.
Self-adjointness suggests that T ought to become its own adjoint under the
injection of V into V*. We check this now. Since (a, (3) = OfJ(a) , we can rewrite
the equation (Ta,{3) = (a, T(3) as OfJ(Ta) = OTtI(a), and again as (T*(0tl)(a) = t,(TrI.)
~ by the definition of T*. This holds for all a and (3 if and only if T*(OfJ) =
OTfJ for all (3 E V, or T* 0 = 0 T, which is the asserted identification.

Lemma 3.1. If V is a finite-dimensional Hilbert space and {<Pi}~ is an
orthonormal basis for V, then T E Hom(V) is self-adjoint if and only if the
matrix {tij} of T with respect to {<Pi} is symmetric (t = t*).
Proof. If we substitute the basis expansions of a and {3 and expand, we see that
(a, T(3) = (Ta, (3) for all a and {3 if and only if (<Pi, T<pj) = (T<pi, <pj) for all i
and j. But T<P1 = Lk=l tkl<Pk, and when this is substituted in these last scalar
products, the equation becomes tij = tji. That is, T is self-adjoint if and only if
t = t*. 0

If a ~ 0 and T(a) = Ca for some c, then a is called an eigenvector (proper
vector, characteristic vector) of T, and c is the associated eigenvalue (proper
value, characteristic value).

Theorem 3.1. If V is a finite-dimensional Hilbert space and T is a selfadjoint element of Hom V, then V has an orthonormal basis consisting
entirely of eigenvectors of T.
Proof. Consider the function (T~, ~). It is a continuous real-valued function
of ~, and on the unit sphere S = {~: II~II = I} it is bounded above by IITII
(by Schwarz). Set m = lub {(TI;,~): II~II = I}. Since S is compact (being
bounded and closed), (T~, ~) assumes the value m at some point a on S. Now
m - T is a nonnegative self-adjoint transformation (Check this!), and (Ta, a) =
m is equivalent to ((m - T)a, a) = o. Therefore, (m - T)a = 0 by Lemma
3.2, and Ta = ma. We have thus found one ~igenvector for T. Now set VI = V,
a1 = a, and m1 = m, and let V 2 be {a1} 1.. Then T[V 2] C V 2, for if I;.l all
then (T~, a1) = (~, Tal) = m(~, a1) = O.
We can therefore repeat the above argument for the restriction of T to the
Hilbert space V 2 and find a2 in V 2 such that IIa211 = 1 and T(a2) = m2a2,
where m2 = lub {(T~, ~) : II ~II = 1 and ~ E V 2J. Clearly, m2 ~ mI. We then
set V 3 = {all a2} 1. and continue, arriving finally at an orthonormal basis
{aig of eigenvectors of T. 0

Now let All •.• , AT be the distinct values in the list mil ... , m n , and let M j
be the linear span of those basis vectors ai for which mi = Aj. Then the subspaces 1I1 j are orthogonal to each other, V = E9; lIfj, each 1I1 j is T-invariant,
and the restriction of T to 1I1 j is Aj times the identity. Since all the nonzero
vectors in 1I1j are eigenvectors with eigenvalue Aj, if the a/s spanning ]lI j are
replaced by any other orthonormal basis for AI j, then we still have an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors. The a/s are therefore not in general uniquely
determined. But the subspaces 1I1 j and the eigenvalues Aj are unique. This will
follow if we show that every eigenvector is in an ]lI j .
Lemma 3.3. In the context of the above discussion, if ~ ~ 0 and T(I;) =
for some x in IR, then ~ E 1I1j (and so x = Aj) for some j.

We have thus proved the following theorem.
Theorelll 3.2. If V is a finite-dimensional Hilbert space and T is a self-

adjoint element of Hom V, then there are uniquely determined subspaces
{Vi}; of V, and distinct scalars {Xi};, such that {Vi} is an orthogonal
family whose sum is V and the restriction of T to Vi is Xi times the identity.
If V is a finite-dimensional vector space and we are given T E Hom V, then
we know how to compute related mappings such as T2 and T- 1 (if it exists)
and vectors Ta, T-1a, etc., by choosing a basis for V and then computing matrix
products, inverses (when they exist), and so on. Some of these computations,
particularly those related to inverses, can be quite arduous. One enormous
advantage of a basis consisting of eigenvectors for T is that it trivializes all of
these calculations.
To see this, let {i3n} be a basis of V consisting entirely of eigenvectors for T,
and let {rn} be the corresponding eigenvalues. To compute T~, we write down
the basis expansion for ~, ~ = L~ Xii3i, and then T~ = L~ rixii3i. T2 has the
same eigenvectors, but with eigenvalues {rl}. Thus T 2 a = L~ rlxii3i. T- 1
exists if and only if no ri = 0, in which case it has the same eigenvectors with
eigenvalues {l/ri}. Thus T- 1 ~ = L~ (x;jri)i3i. If P(t) = L~ ant n is any
polynomial, then P(T) takes i3i into P(ri)i3i. Thus P(T) ~ = L~ P(ri)xii3i.
By now the point should be amply clear.
The additional value of orthonormality in a basis is already clear fom the
last section. Basically, it enables us to compute the coefficients {Xi} of ~ by
scalar products: Xi = (~, i3i).
This is a good place to say a few words about the general eigenvalue problem
in finite-dimensional theory. Our complete analysis above was made possible by
the self-adjointness of T (or the symmetry of the matrix t). What we can say
about an arbitrary T in Hom V is much less satisfactory.
We first note that the eigenvalues of T can be determined algebraically, for X
is an eigenvalue if and only if T - XI is not injective, or, equivalently, is singular, and we know that T - XIis singular ifand only if its determinant .1(T - XI)
is O. If we choose any basis for V, the determinant of T - XI is the determinant
of its matrix t - Xe, and our later formula in Chapter 7 shows that this is a
polynomial of degree n in X. It is easy to see that this polynomial is independent
of the basis; it is called the characteristic polynomial of T. Thus the eigenvalues
of T are exactly the roots of the characteristic polynomial of T.

However, T need not have any eigenvectors! Consider, for example, a 90

Then the matrix of T - A is

and the characteristic polynomial of T is the determinant of this matrix: A2
1.
Since this polynomial is irreducible over IR, there are no eigenvalues.
Note how different the outcome is if we consider the transformation with the
same matrix on complex 2-space (:2. Here the scalar field is the complex number
system, and T is the map -< z}, Z2> f-4 -< -Z2, Zl > from (:2 to (:2. But now
>-.2
1 = (>-.
i)(>-' - i), and T has eigenvalues ±i! To find the eigenvectors
for i, we solve T(z) = iz, which is the equation -< -Z2, Zl > = -< iz}, iz 2 > , or
Z2 = -iz l . Thus -<1, -i> (or i-<l, -i> = -<i, 1» is the unique eigenvector for i to within a scalar multiple.
We return to our real theory. If T E Hom V and n = d(V), so that
d(Hom V) = n 2 , then the set of n 2
1 vectors {T i 2 in Hom V is dependent.
But this is exactly the same as saying that p(T) = 0 for some polynomial p of
degree ~n2. That is, any T in Hom V satisfies a polynomial identity p(T) = O.
Now suppose that T is an eigenvalue of T and that TW = T~. Then p(T)(O =
p(/') ~ === 0, and so p(r) = O. That is, every eigenvalue of T is a root of the
polynomial p. Conversely, if p(r) = 0, then we know from the remainder
theorem of algebra that t - l' is a factor of the polynomial p(t), and therefore
(t - 1')1n will be one of the relatively prime factors of p. Now suppose that p is
the minimal polynomial of T (see Exercise 3.5). Theorem 5.5, Chapter 1, tells
us that (T - 1'I)m is zero on a corresponding subspace N of V and therefore, in
particular, that T - rl is not injective when restricted to N. That is, l' is an
eigenvalue. We have proved:

exists an orthogonal n X n matrix b such that b- 1tb is a diagonal matrix.

Theorelll 4.2. Let t

Proof. Since the transformation T E Hom IR n defined by t is self-adjoint, there
exists an orthonormal basis {bi} i of eigenvectors of T, with corresponding
eigenvalues {ri}i. Let B be the orthogonal transformation defined by B(~i) =
bi, j = 1, ... ,n. (The n-tuples b i are the columns of the matrix b = {bii}
of B.) Then (B- 1 0 T 0 B)(~i) = ri~i. Since (B- 1 0 T 0 B)(~i) is the jth
column of b- 1tb, we see that s = b- 1 tb is diagonal, with 8ji = rj. 0

For later applications we are also going to want the following result.
Theorelll 4.3. Any invertible T E Hom V on a finite-dimensional Hilbert
space V can be expressed in the form T = RS, where R is orthogonal and S
is self-adjoint and positive.

Proof. For any T, T*T is self-adjoint, since (T*T)* = T*T** = T*T. Let
{'Pi}i be an orthonormal eigenbasis, and let {ri}i be the corresponding eigenvalues of T*T. Then 0 < II T'Pi1l 2 = (T*T'Pi, tpi) = (ritpi, 'Pi) = ri for each i.
Since all the eigenvalues of T*T are thus positive, we can define a positive square
root S = (T*T)1/2 by Stpi = (ri)1/2tpi, i = 1,2, ... ,n. It is clear that S2 =
T*T and that S is self-adjoint.
Then A = ST- 1 is orthogonal, for (ST- 1a, ST- 1fJ) = (T- 1a, S2T- 1fJ) =
(T- 1a, T*TT- 1fJ) = (T- 1a, T*fJ) = (TT- 1a, fJ) = (a, fJ). Since T = A -IS,
we set R = A-I and have the theorem. 0

It is not hard to see that the above factorization of T is unique. Also, by
starting with TT*, we can express T in the form T = SR, where S is self-adjoint
and positive and R is orthogonal.
We call these factorizations the polar decompositions of T, since they function somewhat like the polar coordinate factorization z = rei8 of a complex
number.
Corollary. Any nonsingular n X n matrix t can be expressed as t = udv,
where u and v are orthogonal and d is diagonal.

Proof. From the theorem we have t = rs, where r is orthogonal and s is symmetric. By Theorem 4.2, s = bdb-l, where d is diagonal and b is orthogonal.
Thus t = rs = (rb)db- 1 = udv, where u = rb and v = b- 1 are both
orthogonal. 0

5. COMPACT TRANSFORMATIONS

Theorem 3.1 breaks down when V is an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space.
A self-adjoint transformation T does not in general have enough eigenvectors
to form a basis for V, and a more sophisticated analysis, allowing for a "continuous spectrum" as well as a "discrete spectrum", is necessary. This enriched situation is the reason for the need for further study of Hilbert space
theory at the graduate level, and is one of the sources of complexity in the
mathematical structure of quantum mechanics.
"
However,
there is one very important special case in which the eigenbasis
theorem is available, and which will have a startling application in the next
chapter.
Definition. Let V and W be any normed linear spaces, and let S be the unit

ball in V. A transformation T in Hom(V, W) is compact if the closure of
T[S] in W is sequentially compact.
TheoreID 5.1. Let V be any pre-Hilbert space, and let T E Hom V be selfadjoint and compact. Then the pre-Hilbert space R = range (T) has an

orthonormal basis {\oi} consisting entirely of eigenvectors of T, and the
corresponding sequence of eigenvalues {rn} converges to 0 (or is finite).
Proof. The proof is just like that of Theorem 3.1 except that we have to start a
little differently. Set m = IITII = lub {IIT(~)II : II ~II = I}, and choose a sequence Hn} such that II ~n II = 1 for all n and I T( ~n) I ---? m. Then

and since m 2 - T2 is a nonnegative self-adjoint transformation, Lemma 3.2
tells that (m 2 - T2)(~n) -7 O. But since T is compact, we can suppose (passing
to a subsequence if necessary) that {T ~n} converges, say to fj. Then T2 ~n -7 Tfj,
and so m2~n -7 Tfj also. Thus ~n -7 Tfj/m 2 and fj = lim T~n = T2(fj)/m 2
Since Ilfjll = lim IIT(~n)1I = m, we have a nonzero vector fj such that T2(fj) =
m 2 fj. Set a = fj/llfjll.
We have thus found a vector a such that Iiall = 1 and 0 = (m 2 - T2)(a) =
(m - T)(m + T)(a). Then either (m + T)(a) = 0, in which case T(a) =
-ma, or (m + T)(a) = 'Y ¢ 0 and (m - T)'Y = 0, in which case T'Y = m'Y.
Thus there exists a vector 'PI (a or 'Y /II'YII) such that II'PIII = 1 and T('PI) =
rl'PI, where hi = m. We now proceed just as in Theorem 3.I.
For notational consistency we set mi = m, V I = V, and now set V 2 =
{'PI} 1.. Then T[V2] C V 2, since if a.i 'Pb then (Ta, 'PI) = (a, T'P2) =
rl(a, 'PI) = O. Thus T V 2is compact and self-adjoint, and if m2 = liT V 211,
there exists 'P2 with 11'P211 = 1 and T('P2) = r2'P2, where Ir21 = m2. We continue
inductively, obtaining an orthonormal sequence {'Pn} C V and a sequence
{rn} C IR such that T'Pn = rn'Pn and Irnl = liT r V nil, where

r

Vn =

{'Pb ... , 'Pn_l}l..

We suppose for the moment, since this is the most interesting case, that
rn ¢ 0 for all n.- Then we claim that Irnl -7 O. For Irnl is decreasing in any case,
and if it does not converge to 0, then there exists a b > 0 such that Irnl ~ b
for all n. Then IIT('Pi) - T('Pj)11 2 = Ilri'Pi - rj'Pj112 = "1Iri'PiI12 + Ilrj'Pjl12 =
ri2 + r; ~ 2b 2 for all i ¢ j, and the sequence {T('Pi)} can have no convergent
subsequence, contradicting the compactness of T. Therefore Irnll O.
Finally, we have to show that the orthonormal sequence {'Pi} is a basis for R.
If fj = T(a), and if {b n} and {an} are the Fourier coefficients of fj and a,
then we expect that bn = rna n, and this is easy to check: bn = (fj, 'Pn) =
(T(a), 'Pn) = (a, T('Pn)) = (a, rn'Pn) = rn(a, 'Pn) = rnan. This is just saying
that T(an'Pn) = bn'Pn' and therefore fj - L~ bi'Pi = T(a - L~ ai'Pi). Now
a - L~ ai'Pi is orthogonal to {'Pi}~ and therefore is an element of V n+b and the
norm of T on V n+l is Irn+ll. Moreover, Iia - L~ ai'Pili ~ lIall, by the Pythagorean theorem. Altogether we can conclude that

CHAPTER 6

DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

This chapter is not a small differential equations textbook; we leave out far too
much. We are principally concerned with some of the theory of the subject,
although we shall say one or two practical things. Our first goal is the fundamental existence and uniqueness theorem of ordinary differential equations,
which we prove as an elegant application of the fixed-point theorem. Next we
look at the linear theory, where we make vital use of material from the first two
chapters and get quite specific about the process of actually finding solutions.
So far our development is linked to the initial-value problem, concerning the
existence of, and in some cases the ways of finding, a unique solution passing
through some initially prescribed point in the space containing the solution
curves. However, some of the most important aspects of the subject relate to
what are called boundary-value problems, and our last and most sophisticated
effort will be directed toward making a first step into this large area. This will
involve us in the theory of Chapter 5, for we shall find ourselves studying selfadjoint operators. In fact, the basic theorem about Fourier series expansion:;;
will come out of recognizing a certain right inverse of a differential operator to be
a compact self-adjoint operator.
1. THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM

Let A be an open subset of a Banach space W, let I be an open interval in IR, and
let F: I X A ~ W be continuous. We want to study the differential equation

dOi/dt = F(t, (1).
A solution of this equation is a function!: J
of I, such that f' (t) exists and

~

A, where J is an open subinterval

f' (t) = F (t, f(t))
for every t in J. Note that a solution f has to be continuously differentiable, for
the existence of f' implies the continuity of f, and then f' (t) = F (t, f( t)) is
continuous by the continuity of F.
Weare going to see that if F has a continuous second partial differential,
then there exists a uniquely determined "local" solution through any point

6.1

THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM

267

In saying that the solution f goes through < to, ao > , we mean, of course, that
ao = f(t o). The requirement that the solution f have the value ao when t = to
is called an initial condition.
The existence and continuity of dF~t.a> implies, via the mean-value
theorem, that F(t, a) is locally uniformly Lipschitz in a. By this we mean that
for any point < to, ao> in I X A there is a neighborhood M X N and a constant
b such that IIF(t, ~) - F(t, '17)11 ::::; bll ~ - '1711 for all t in M and all ~, '17 in N.
To see this we simply choose balls M and N about to and ao such that dF~I.a> is
bounded, say by b, on M X N, and apply Theorem 7.4 of Chapter 3. This is the
condition that we actually use below.
Let A be an open subset of a Banach space W, let I be an
open interval in IR, and let F be a continuous mapping from I X A to W
which is locally uniformly Lipschitz in its second variable. Then for any
point <to, ao> in I X A, for some neighborhood U of ao and for any
sufficiently small interval J containing to, there is a unique function f from
J to U which is a solution of the differential equation passing through the
point < to, ao> .
Theorelll 1.1.

Proof. If f is a solution on J through
f(t) - f(t o) =

< to, ao> , then an integration gives

r

l

110

F(s,f(s)) ds,

so that

f(t)

= ao + r t F(s,f(s)) ds
lto

for t E J. Conversely, if f satisfies this "integral equation", then the fundamental theorem of the calculus implies that !'(t) exists and equals F(t,f(t))
on J, so thatfis a solution of the differential equation which clearly goes through
< to, ao>. Now for any continuous f: J ---7 A we can define g: J ---7 W by

g(t) = ao

+ ltort F(s,f(s)) ds,

and our argument above shows that f is a solution of the differential equation if
and only if f is a fixed point of the mapping K: f f---+ g. This suggests that we try
to show that K is a contraction, so that we can apply the fixed-point theorem.
We start by choosing a neighborhood L X U of <to, ao> on which F(t, a)
is bounded and Lipschitz in a uniformly over t. Let J be some open subinterval
of L containing to, and let V be the Banach space CJ3e(J, W) of bounded continuous functions from J to W. Our later calculation will show how small we
have to take J. We assume that the neighborhood U is a ball about ao of radius
r, and we consider the ball of functions 'U = Br(ao) in V, where ao is the constant function with value ao. Then any fin 'U has its range in U, so that F(t, f(t))
is defined, bounded, and continuous. That is, K as defined earlier maps the ball
'U into V.

of J. Then

From (2) we see that K is a contraction with constant C = OC if OC < 1, and
from (1) we see that K moves the center ao of the ball 'ti a distance less than

s > to, and set C = {t: t > to and gl (t) ~ g2(t)} and x = glb C. The set C
is open, since gl and g2 are continuous, and therefore x is not in C. That is,
gl(X) = g2(X). Call this common value a and apply the theorem to <x, a>-.
With r such that Br(a) CA, we choose 0 small enough so that the differential
equation has a unique solution g from (x - 0, x
0) to Br(a) passing through
<x, a>-, and we also take 0 small enough so that the restrictions of gl and g2 to
(x - 0, x
0) have ranges in Br(a). But then gl = g2 = g on this interval
by the uniqueness of g, and this contradicts the definition of x. Therefore,
gl = g2 on the intersection of their domains. 0

point -< t l , al > near the end of such a local solution and then consider the local
solution about -< tt, al > , first of all it will have to agree with our first solution
on the intersection of the two domains, and secondly it will in general extend
farther beyond tl than the first solution, so the two local solutions will fit together
to make a solution on a larger t-interval than either gives separately. We can
continue in this way to extend our original solution to what might be called a
global solution, made up of a patchwork of matching local solutions. These
notions are somewhat vague as described above, and we now turn to a more
precise construction of a global solution.
Given -< to, ao> C I X A, let (f be the family of all solutions through
-< to, ao>. Thus g E (f if and only if g is a solution on an interval J C I, to E J,
and g(to) = ao. Lemma 1.1 shows exactly that the uniont f of all the functions g
in (f is itself a function, for if -< t l , al > E gl and -< tIl a2 > E g2, then al =
gl (t) = g2(t) = a2'
Moreover, f is a solution, because around any x in its domain f agrees with
some g E (f. By the way f was defined we see that f is the unique maximum
solution through -< to, ao>. We have thus proved the following theorem.
Theorelll 1.3. Let F: I X A ~ V be a function satisfying the hypotheses of
Theorem 1.1. Then through each -< to, ao> in I X A there is a uniquely
determined maximal solution to the differential equation dajdt = F(t, a).

In general, we would have to expect a maximal solution to "run into the
boundary of A" and therefore to have a domain interval J properly included in I,
as Fig. 6.1 suggests.

t Remember that we are taking a function to be a set of ordered pairs, so that the
union of a family of functions makes precise sense.

DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

However, if A is the whole space W, and if F(t, a) is Lipsohitz in a for each t,
with a Lipschitz bound e(t) that is continuous in t, then we can show that each
maximal solution is over the whole of I. We shall shortly see that this condition
is a natural one for the linear equation.

W be a Banach space, and let I be an open interval in ~.
Let F: I X W ~ W be continuous, and suppose that there is a continuous
function e: I ~ ~ such that
Theorem 1.4. Let

for all t in I and all aI, a2 in W. Then each maximal solution to the differential equation daldt = F(t, a) has the whole of I for its domain.

Proof. Suppose, on the contrary, that g is a maximal solution whose domain
interval J has right-hand endpoint b less than that of I. We choose a finite open
interval L containing b and such that LeI (see Fig. 6.2). Since L is compact,
the continuous function e(t) has a maximum value e on L. We choose any tl
in L n J close enough to b so that b - tl < lie, and we set al = g(t l ) and
m = max IIF(t, al) lion L. With these values of e and m, and with any r, the
proof of Theorem 1.1 gives us a local solution f through -< t l , al >- with domain
(It - 5, tl
5) for any 5 less than r/(m
re) = liCe
(mlr». Since we
now have no restriction on r (because A = W), this bound on 5 becomes
lie, and since we chose tl so that tl
(lie) > b, we can now choose 5 so that
tl
5 > b. But this gives us a contradiction; the maximal solution g through
-< tt, al >- includes the local solution f, so that, in particular, tl 5 :::; b.
We have thus proved the theorem. 0

Going back to our original situation, we can conclude that if the Lipschitz
control of F is of the stronger type assumed above, and if the domain J of some
maximal solution g is less than I, then the open set A cannot be the whole of W.
It is in fact true that the distance from g(t) to the boundary of A approaches
zero as t approaches an endpoint b of J which is interior to I. That is, it is now a
theorem that p(j(t), A') ~ 0 as t ~ b. The proof is more complicated than our
argument above, and we leave it as a set of exercises for the interested reader.

6.1

THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM

271

A functionf: J ~ W is a solution to this equation if J is an open subinterval of
I, f has continuous derivatives on J up to the nth order, f(i-ll[J] C Ai, i =
1, ... , n, and
f(n)(t) = GCt, f(t),f'(t), . .. ,pn-ll(t))
for t E J. An initial condition is now given by a point

-<to, f3I, f32,"" f3n>- E I X Al X··· X An.
The basic theorem is almost the same as before. To simplify our notation, let a
be the n-tuple -< aI, a2, ... , a n >- in wn = V, and set A =
Ai. Also let
1/1 be the mapping f 1---+ -< f, 1', ... , f(n-I) >- . Then the solution equation
becomesf(n)(t) = GCt,1/If(t)).

In

Theorem 1.5. Let G: I X A ~ W be as above and suppose, in addition,
that G(t, a) is locally uniformly Lipschitz in a. Then for any -< to, fJ >- in
I X A and for any sufficiently small open interval J containing to, there is a
unique functionffrom J to W such thatfis a solution to the above nth-order
equation satisfying the initial condition if;f(t o) = fJ.

Proof. There is an ancient and standard device for reducing a single nth-order
equation to a system of first-order equations. The idea is to replace the single
equation
dna/dtn = G(t, a, da/dt, ... ,dn-Ia/dtn- I )
by the system of equations

daddt
da2/dt

= a2,
= aa,

dan_ddt = an,
dan/dt = G(t, aI, a2, ... , an),
and then to recognize this system as equivalent to a single first-order equation
on a different space. In fact, if we define the mapping F = -<FI, ... , F n >from I X A to V = wn by setting Fi(t, a) = ai+I for i = 1, ... , n - 1, and
Fn(t, a) = G(t, a), then the above system becomes the single equation

da/dt = F(t, a),
where F is clearly locally uniformly Lipschitz in a. Now a function f =
-<iI, ... ,fn >- from J to V is a solution of this equation if and only if
f~ =h,

that is, if and only if f1 has derivatives up to order n, t/!(/I) = f and f~n\t) =
GCt, t/!/I(t). The n-tuplet initial condition 1/If(to) = fl is now just f(to) = fl.
Thus the nth-order theorem for G has turned into the first-order theorem for F,
and so follows from Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 0
The local solution through -< to, fl> extends to a unique maximal solution
by Theorem 1.3 applied to our first-order problem dot./dt = F(t, a), and the
domain of the maximal solution is the whole of I if G(t, a) is Lipschitz in a with
a bound c(t) that is continuous and if A = W n , as in Theorem 1.4.

2. DIFFERENTIABLE DEPENDENCE ON PARAMETERS

It is exceedingly important in some applications to know how the solution to the
system
f'(t) = G(t,f(t)),
varies with the initial point -< t l , al >-. In order to state the problem precisely,
we fix an open interval J, set 'U = Br(ao) C V = CBe(J, W) as in the previous
section, and require a solution in'U passing through -< h, al >- , where -< h, al >is near -< to, ao>-. Supposing that a unique solution f exists, we then have a
mapping -< tll al >- ~ f, and it is the continuity and differentiability of this map
that we wish to study.

-< to, ao>- in the Banach
space ~ X W, and let F(t, a) be a bounded continuous mapping from
L X U to W which is Lipschitz in a uniformly over t. Then there is a neighborhood J X N of -< to, ao>- with the following property. For any -< tll al >in J X N there is a unique function f from J to U which is a solution of the
differential equation da/dt = F(t, a) passing through -< t l , al >-, and the
mapping -< t l , al >- ~ f from J X N to V is continuous.
TheoreDl 2.1. Let L X U be a neighborhood of

Proof. We simply reexamine the calculation of Theorem 1.1 and take 0 a little
smaller. Let K(tll all f) be the mapping of that theorem but with initial point
-< t l , al >-, so that g = K(t l , all f) if and only if get) = al ft~ F(s, f(s)) ds for
all t in J. Clearly K is continuous in -< tl, al >- for each fixed f.
If N is the ball B r / 2 (ao), then the inequality (1) in the proof shows that
IIK(tll aI, ao) - aoll ~ lIal - aoll
om ~ r/2
om. The second inequality
remains unchanged. Therefore, f ~ K(tll aI, f) is a map from'U to V which is a
contraction with constant C = OC if OC < 1, and which moves the center ao of 'U
a distance less than (1 - C)r if r/2
om < (1 - oc)r. This new double
requirement on 0 is equivalent to

our theorem. 0
If we want the map -< tll al >- ~ f to be differentiable, it is sufficient, by
Theorem 9.4 of Chapter 4, to know in addition to the above that
K:(JXN)X'U~V

is continuously differentiable. And to deduce this, it is sufficient to suppose that
dF exists and is utniformly continuous on L X U.

the context of the above theorem, the solution f is a continuously differentiable function of the initial value -< tt, at >- .
Proof. We have to show that the map K(tt, at, f) from (J X N) X '11 to Vis continuously differentiable, after which we can apply Theorem 9.4 of Chapter 4, as
we remarked above. Now the mapping h 1--+ k defined by k(t) = ft~ h(s) ds is a
bounded linear mapping from V to V which clearly depends continuously on tt,
and by Theorem 14.3 of Chapter 3 the integrand map f 1--+ h defined by h(s) =
F(s, f(s)) is continuously differentiable on '11. Composing these two maps we see
that dK~tl''''l.J> exists and is continuous on J X N X '11. Now

LlK~tl''''l.J>(~)

= ~,

so that dK 2 = I, and LlK~tl''''l.J>(h) = - ft~l+h F(s,f(s)) ds, from which it
follows easily that dK~tl''''l.J>(h) =-hF(tt,f(t)). The three partial differentials
dK t , dK 2 , and dK 3 thus exist and are continuous on J X N X '11, and it follows
from Theorem 8.3 of Chapter 3 that KCtt, at, f) is continuously differentiable
there. D
Corollary. If s is any point in J, then the value f(s) of a solution at s is a
differentiable function of its value at to.

Proof. Let f", be the solution through -< to, a>-. By the theorem, a 1--+ f", is a
continuously differentiable map from N to the function space V = ffie(J, W).
Eut 71'8: f 1--+ f(s) is a bounded linear mapping and thus trivially continuously
differentiable. Composing these two maps, we see that a 1--+ f",(s) is continuously
differentiable on N. D
It is also possible to make the continuous and differentiable dependence of
the solution on its initial value -< to, ao>- into a global affair. The following is
the theorem. We shall not go into its proof here.
Theorem 2.3. Let f be the maximal solution through -< to, ao>- with domain
J, and let [a, b] be any finite closed subinterval of J containing to. Then there
exists an E > 0 such that for every -< tt, at >- E B E( -< to, ao>-) the domain
of the global solution through -<tt, at >- includes [a, b], and the restriction
of this solution to [a, b] is a continuous function of -< tt, at >-. If F satisfies
the hypotheses of Theorem 2.2, then this dependence is continuously
differentiable.

Finally, suppose that F depends continuously (or continuously differentiably) on a parameter A, so that we have F(A, t, a) on M X I X A. Now the
solution f to the initial-value problem
f'(t) = F(t,f(t)),

depends on the parameter A as well as on the initial condition fUt) = at, and if
the reader has fully understood our arguments above, he will see that we can
show in the same way that the dependence of f on A is also continuous (continuously differentiable). We shall not go into these details here.

DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

3. THE LINEAR EQUATION

We now suppose that the function F of Section 1 is from I X W to Wand continuous, and that F(t, a) is linear in a for each fixed t. It is not hard to see that
we then automatically have the strong Lipschitz hypothesis of Theorem 1.4,
which we shall in any case now assume. Here this is a boundedness condition
on a linear map: we are assuming that F(t, a) = Tt(a), where T t E Hom W,
and that II Ttll :::; e(t) for all t, where e(t) is continuous on I.
As one might expect, in this situation the existence and uniqueness theory of
Section 1 makes contact with general linear theory. Let X 0 be the vector space
e(1, W) of all continuous functions from I to W, and let X 1 be its subspace
e 1 (1, W) of all functions having continuous first derivatives. Norms will play
no role in our theorem.
Theorem 3.1. The mapping S: X 1 ~ X 0 defined by setting g = Sf if
get) = f'(t) - F(t, f(t)) is a surjective linear mapping. The set N of global
solutions of the differential equation da/dt = F(t, a) is the null space of S,
and is therefore, in particular, a vector space. For each to E I the restriction
to N of the coordinate (evaluation) mapping 'Trto: f ~ f(t o) is an isomorphism
from N to W. The null space M of 'Trto is therefore a complement of N in X 1,
and so determines a right inverse R of S. The mapping f ~ -< Sf, f(to) >
is an isomorphism from X 1 to X 0 X W, and this fact is equivalent to all
the above assertions.

+

Proof. For any fixed gin Xo we set G(t, a) = F(t, a)
get) and consider the
(nonlinear) equation da/dt = G(t, a). By Theorems 1.3 and 1.4 it has a unique
maximal solution f through any initial point -< to, ao>, and the domain of f is
the whole of I. That is, for each pair -< g, a> in X 0 X W there is a unique f in
X 1 such that -< Sf, f(to) > = -< g, a>. The mapping
-<S, 'Trto> :f~ -<Sf,f(t o»

is thus bijective, and since it is clearly linear, it is an isomorphism. In particular,
S is surjective. The null space N of S is the inverse image of {O} X W under the
above isomorphism; that is, 'Trto r N is an isomorphism from N to W.
Finally, the null space M of 'Trto is the inverse image of X 0 X {O} under
-< S, 'Tr to> , and the direct sum decomposition X 1 = M $ N simply reflects the
decomposition X 0 X W = (X 0 X {O}) EB ({O} X W) under the inverse isomorphism. This finishes the proof of the theorem. 0
The problem of finding, for a given g in X 0 and a given ao in W, the unique f
in X 1 such that S(f) = g and f(t o) = ao is called the initial-value problem. At
the theoretical level, the problem is solved by the above theorem, which states
that the uniquely determined f exists. At the practical level of computation, the
problem remains important.
The fact that M = Mt o is a complement of N breaks down the initial-value
problem into two independent subproblems. The right inverse R associated with

6.3

THE LINEAR EQUATION

277

Mt o finds h in X 1 such that S(h) = g and h(t o) = O. The inverse of the isomorphism f 1-+ f(to) from N to W selects that k in Xl such that S(k) = 0 and
k(t o) = ao. Then f = h + k. The first subproblem is the problem of "solving
the inhomogeneous equation with homogeneous initial data ", and the second is
the problem of "solving the homogeneous equation with inhomogeneous initial
data". In a certain sense the initial-value problem is the "direct sum" of these
two independent problems.
We shall now study the homogeneous equation da/dt = Tt(a) more closely.
As we saw above, its solution space N is isomorphic to W under each projection
map 'lrt = f 1-+ f(t). Let CPt be this isomorphism (so that CPt = 'lrt N). We now
choose some fixed to in I-we may as well suppose that I contains 0 and take
to = O-and set K t = CPt 0 CPOI. Then {K t} is a one-parameter family of linear
isomorphisms of W with itself, and if we setf(3(t) = K t ({3), thenf(3 is the solution
of da/dt = Tt(a) passing through <0, fJ>. We call K t a fundamental solution of
the homogeneous equation da/dt = Tt(a).
Since fp(t) = Tt(f(3(t)), we see that d(Kt)/dt = T t 0 K t in the sense that
the equation is true at each fJ in W. However, the derivative d(Kt)/dt does not
necessarily exist as a norm limit in Hom W. This is because our hypotheses on T,
do not imply that the mapping t 1-+ T t is continuous from I to Hom W. If this
mapping is continuous, then the mapping <t, A> 1-+ T t 0 A is continuous from
I X Hom W to Hom W, and the initial-value problem

r

dA/dt = T t 0 A,

Ao = I

has a unique solution At in (31(1, Hom W). Because evaluation at fJ is a bounded
linear mapping from Hom W to W, At(fJ) is a differentiable function of t and

This implies that At(fJ) = Kt(fJ) for all fJ, so K t = At. In particular, the
fundamental solution t 1-+ K t is now a differentiable map into Hom W, and
dKt/dt = T t 0 K t. We have proved the following theorem.
Theorem. 3.2. Let t

1-+ T t be a continuous map from an interval neighborhood I of 0 to Hom W. Then the fundamental solution t 1-+ K t of the
differential equation da/dt = Tt(a) is the parametrized arc from I to
Hom W that is the solution of the initial-value problem dA/dt = T t 0 A,
Ao = I.

In terms of the isomorphisms K t = K(t), we can now obtain an explicit
solution for the inhomogeneous equation dajdt = Tt(a) + g(t). We want f such
that
f'(t) - Tt(f(t)) = g(t).
Now K'(t) = T t 0 K(t), so that T t = K'(t) 0 K(t)-l, and it follows from
Exercise 8.12 of Chapter 4 and the general product rule for differentiation

278

(Theorem 8.4 of Chapter 3) that the left side of the equation above is exactly

K(t)

(~t [K(t)-l (J(t) )]) .

The equation we have to solve can thus be rewritten as

We therefore have an obvious solution, and even if the reader has found our
:plOtivating argument too technical, he should be able to check the solution by
differentiating.

In the context of Theorem 3.2, the function

da/dt

+ g(t),

f(O) =

This therefore is a formula for the right inverse R of S determined by thp
complement M 0 of the null space N of S.
The special case of the constant coefficient equation, where the "coefficient"
operator T t is a fixed T in Hom W, is extremely important. The first new fact.
to be observed is that if f is a solution of da/dt = T(a), then so is 1'. For the
equationf'(t) = T(j(t) has a differentiable right-hand side, and differentiating,
we getf"(t) = T(j'(t). That is:
Lelllllla 3.1.

da/dt

The solution space N of the constant coefficient equation

= T(a) is invariant under the derivative operator D.

Moreover, we see from the differential equation that the operator D on N
is just composition with T. More precisely, the equation f'(t) = T(J(t) can be
rewritten 'lrt 0 D = To 'lrt, and since the restriction of 'lrt to N is the isomorphism CPt from N to W, this equation can be solved for T. We thus have the
following lemma.
Lemma 3.2. For each fixed t the isomorphism CPt from N to W takes the
derivative operator D on N to the operator T on W. That is,

The equation for the fundamental solution K t is now dS/dt = TS. In the
elementary calculus this is the equation for the exponential function, which leads
us to expect and immediately check that K t = etT • (See the end of Section 8 of
Chapter 4.) The solution of da/dt = T(a) through <0, {3> is thus the function

THE LINEAR EQUATION

If T satisfies a polynomial equation p(T) = 0, as we know it must if W is
finite-dimensional, then our analysis can be carried significantly further. Suppose
for now that p has only real roots, so that its relatively prime factorization is
p(x) = II~(x - Xi)m i. Then we know from Theorem 5.5 of Chapter 1 that W
is the direct sum W = EB~ Wi of the null spaces Wi of the transformations
(T - Xi)m i , and that each Wi is invariant under T. This gives us a much simpler
form for the solution curve etTa if the point a is in one of the null spaces Wi.
Taking such a subspace Wi itself as W for the moment, we have (T - Xl)m = 0,
so that T = XI
R, where Rm = 0, and the factorization etT = et).e tR ,
together with the now finite series expansion of etR , gives us

In the general situation where W = EB~ Wi, we have a = L:~ ai, etT(a), =

through the general point -< 0, a>- is thus a finite sum of terms of the form

If W is a complex Banach space, then the restriction that p have only real
roots is superfluous. We get exactly the same formula but with complex values
of X. This introduces more variety into the behavior of the solution curves
since an outside exponential factor et). = etpe iIP now has a periodic factor if

Altogether we have proved the following theorem.

It is important to notice how the asymptotic behavior of f(t) as t ---?

where GCt, a) = GCt, ab ..• , an) is now linear from V = wn to W for each t in I.
We convert this to a first-order equation da/dt = FCt, a) just as before, where
now F is a map from I X V to V that is linear in its second variable a, FCt, a) =
TtCa).
Our proof of Theorem 1.5 showed that a functionf in e(n) (I, W) is a solution
of the nth-order equation dna/dtn = G(t, a, ... , dn-Ia/dt n- l ) if and only if
the n-tuplet 1/;f = -<f,!', ... ,f(n-O> is a solution of the first-order equation
da/dt = F(t, a) = TtCa). We know that the latter solutions form a vector
subspace N of el(I, wn), and since the map 1/;: f I--'t -<f,!', ... ,!'n-l) > is
linear from en(l, W) to el(I, W n), it follows that the set N of solutions of the
nth-order equation is a subspace of en(I, W) and 1/; N is an isomorphism from
'N to N. Since the coordinate evaluation CPt = 7rt N is an isomorphism from N

further study, and we shall not go into it here.
We recapitulate what our general linear theory tells us about this situation.
Theorem 4.1. L is a surjective linear transformation from the space en(l)

of all real-valued functions on I having continuous derivatives through
order n to the space e°(I) = e(I) of continuous functions on I. Its null
space N is the solution space of our original differential equation. For

f in en such that f(to) = ... = fIn-OCto) = 0 is therefore a complement
of N in en(I), and determines a linear right inverse of L.
The practical problem of "solving" the differential equation LU) = g for J
when g is given falls into two parts. First we have to find the null space N of L,
that is, we have to solve the homogeneous equation LU) = O. Since N is all
n-dimensional vector space, the problem of delineating it is equivalent to finding
a basis, and this is clearly the efficient way to proceed. Our first problem therefore is to find n linearly independent solutions {uiE of LU) = O. Our second
problem is to find a right inverse of L, that is, a linear way of picking one f such
that LU) = g for each g. Here the obvious thing to do is to try to make th(,
formula of Theorem 3.3 into a practical computation. If v is one solution or
LU) = g, then of course the set of all solutions is the affine subspace N
v.
We shall start with the first problem, that of finding a basis {Ui} ~ of solutiolls
to LU) = O. Unfortunately, there is no general method available, and we hav(~
to be content with partial success. We shall see that we can easily solve thp
first-order equation directly, and that if we can find one solution of the nthorder equation, then we can reduce the problem to solving an equation of order
n - 1. Moreover, in the very important special case of an operator L with
constant coefficients, Theorem 3.4 gives a complete explicit solution.
The first-order homogeneous linear equation can be written in the form
y'
a(t)y = 0, where the coefficient of y' has been divided out. Dividing by y

and remembering that y' /y = (log y)" we see that, formally at least, a solution
is given by log y = - Ja(t) dt or y = e-fa<tldt, and we can check it by inspection. Thus the equation y'
y/t = 0 has a solution y = e-1og t = 1ft, as the
reader might have noticed directly.
Suppose now that L is an nth-order operator and that we know one solution
U of Lf = o. Our problem then is to find n - 1 solutions VlJ ••• ,Vn-l independent of each other and of u. It might even be reasonable to guess that these
could be determined as solutions of an equation of order n - 1. We try to find
a second solution vet) in the form c(t)u(t), where c(t) is an unknown function.
Our motivation, in part, is that such a solution would automatically be independent of u unless c(t) turns out to be a constant.
Now if vet) = c(t)u(t), then v' = cu'
c'u, and generally

where S is a certain linear differential operator of order n - 1 which can be
explicitly computed from the above formulas. We claim that solving S(n = 0
solves our original problem. For suppose that {gin- l is a basis for the null
space of S, and set Ci(t) = Jci gi. Then L(CiU) = S(c~) = S(gi) = 0 for i =
1, ... , n - 1. Moreover, u, ClU, ... ,Cn_lU are independent, for if u =
L~-l kic.u, then 1 = L~-l kiCi(t) and 0 = L~-l kiC~(t) = L~-l kigi(t), contradicting the independence of the set {gi}.
We have thus shown that if we can find one solution u of the nth-order
equation Lf = 0, then its complete solution is reduced to solving an equation
Sf = 0 of order n - 1 (although our independence argument was a little
sketchy).
This reduction procedure does not combine with the solution of the firstorder equation to build up a sequence of independent solutions of the nth-order
equation because, roughly speaking, it "works off the top instead of off the
bottom". For the combination to be successful, we would have to be able to
find from a given nth-order operator a first-order operator S such that N(S) C
N(L), and we can't do this in general. However, we can do it when the coefficient
functions in L are all constants, although we shall in fact proceed differently.
Meanwhile it is valuable to note that a second-order equation Lf = 0 can
be solved completely if we can find one solution u, since the above argument
reduces the remaining problem to a first-order equation which can then be solved
by an integration, as we saw earlier. Consider, for instance, the equation
y" - 2y/t 2 = 0 over any interval I not containing 0, so that ao(t) = l/t 2 is
continuous on I. We see by inspection that u(t) = t 2 is one solution. Then we

284

know that we can find a solution vet) independent of u(t) in the form vet) = t 2c(t)
and that the problem will become a first-order problem for c'. We have, in fac1,
v' = t 2 c' + 2tc and v" = t 2 c" + 4tc' + 2c, so that L(v) = v" - 2v/t 2 =
t 2 c" 4tc', and L(v) = 0 if and only if (c')'

(to within a scalar multiple; we only want a basis!), and v = t 2 c(t) = l/l.
(The reader may wish to check that this is the promised solution.) The null
space of the operator LU) = f" - 2f/t 2 is thus the linear span of {t 2 , l/t] .
We now turn to an important tractable case, the differential operator

Lf = anf(n)

+ an_d(n-O + ... + aof,

where the coefficients ai are constants and an might as well be taken to 1. What
makes this case accessible is that now L is a polynomial in the derivative operator
D. That is, if Df =!" so that Djf = f(j), then L = p(D), where p(x) =
L~ aixi.
The most elegant, but not the most elementary, way to handle this equation
is to go over to the equivalent first-order system dx/dt = T(x) on IR n and to
apply the relevant theory from the last section.
Theorem 4.2. If pet) = (t - b)n, then the solution space N of the
stant coefficient nth-order equation p(D)f = 0 has the basis

COIl-

{e bt , te bt , ... , tn-1e bt }.
If pet) is a polynomial which has a relatively prime factorization pet) =
II~ Pi(t) with each P.(t) of the above fonn, then the solution space of the
constant coefficient equation p(D)f = 0 has the basis UB" where Bi is th(!
above basis for the solution space Ni of pi(D)f = O.

Proof. We know that the mapping if;:f~ <'f,!', ... ,f(n-O>- is an isomorphism from the null space N of p(D) to the null space N of dx/dt - T(x). It i;;
clear that if; commutes with differentiation, if;(Df) = <.!', ... , f(n) >- = Dif; (f) ,
and since we know that N is invariant under D by Lemma 3.1, it follows (and call
easily be checked directly) that N is invariant under D. By Lemma 3.2 we have
T = CPt 0 D 0 CPt 1, which simply says that the isomorphism CPt: N ---7 IR n take;;
the operator D on N into the operator T on IRn. Altogether CPt 0 if; takes D
on N into Ton IR n, and since p(D) = 0 on N, it follows that peT) = 0 on IRn.
We saw in Theorem 3.4 that if peT) = 0 and p = (t - b)n, then the
solution space N of dx/dt = T(x) is spanned by vectors of the form

The first coordinates of the n-tuple-valued functions g in N form the space N
(under the isomorphism f = if;-lg), and we therefore see that N is spanned by
the functions ebt , ... ,tn-1ebt . Since N is n-dimensional, and since there are n
of these functions, the spanning set forms a basis.

The remainder of the theorem can be viewed as the combination of the
above and the direct application of Theorem 5.5 of Chapter 1 to the equation
p(D) = 0 on N, or as the carry-over to N under the isomorphism 1/; -1 of the facts
already established for N in the last section. 0
If the roots of the polynomial p are not all real, then we have to resort to
the complexification theory that we developed in the exercises of Section 11,
Chapter 4. Except for one final step, the results are the same. The one extra
fact that has to be applied is that the null space of a real operator T acting on a
real vector space Y is exactly the intersection with Y of the null space of the
complexification S of T acting on the complexification Z = Y EB iY of Y.
This implies that if p(t) is a polynomial with real coefficients, then we get the
real solutions of p(D)f = 0 as the real parts of the complex solutions. In order
to see exactly what this means, suppose that q(x) = (x 2 - 2bx
c)m is one of
the relatively prime factors of p(x) over tR, with x 2 - 2bx c irreducible over tR.
Over C, q(x) factors into (x - A)m(X - x)m, where A = b + iw and w 2 = c - b 2.
It follows from our general theory above that the complex 2m-dimensional
null space of q(D) is the complex span of

+

+

e~t teXt
{e ht, teht , ... , t m- 1eht"
, ... , t m- 1eXt } .

The real parts of the complex linear combinations of these 2m functions is a
2m-dimensional real vector space spanned by the real parts of the above functions
and the real parts of i times the above functions. That is, the null space of the
real operator q(D) is a 2m-dimensional real space spanned by
{e bt cos wt, te bt cos wt, ... , t m- 1ebt cos wt; ebt sin wt, ... , t m- 1ebt sin wt}.

Since there are 2m of these functions, they must be independent and must form
a basis for the real solution space of q(D)f = O. Thus,
Theorelll 4.3. If p(t) = (t2 + 2bt + c)m and b 2 < c, then the solution space
of the constant coefficient 2mth-order equation p(D)f = 0 has the basis
{ t i ebt

{ i bt·
}m-l
cos wt }m-l
i=O ute sm wt i=O,

where w2 = c - b2. For any polynomial p(t) with real coefficients, if p(t) =
II~ Pi(t) is its relatively prime factorization into powers of linear factors and
powers of irreducible quadratic factors, then the solution space N of
p(D)f = 0 has the basis U~ B i , where Bi is the basis for the null space of
Pi(D) that we displayed above if Pi(t) is a power of an irreducible quadratic,
and Bi is the basis of Theorem 4.2 if Pi(t) is a power of a linear factor.
Suppose, for example, that we want to find a basis for the null space of
D4 - 1 = O. Here p(x) = X4 - 1 = (x - l)(x + l)(x - i)(x + i). The
basis for the complex solution space is therefore {e t, e- t, eit, e-it }. Since eit =
cos t i sin t, the basis for the real solution space is {e t, e-t, cos t, sin t}.

and the basis for the real solution space is
{e t , e- t/ 2 cos (V3t/2), e- t/ 2 sin (y'3t/2)}.

* Our results above suggest that the collection a of all real-valued
solutions of constant coefficient homogeneous linear differential equations contains the functions ti, ert , cos wt, sin wt for all i, r, and w, and is closed under
addition and multiplication, and is in fact the algebra generated by these functions.
We can easily prove this conjecture. We first consider sums. Suppose that
T(f) = 0 and that S(g) = 0, where Sand T are two such constant coefficient
operators. Then f
g is in the null space of SoT because Sand T commute:
(S 0 T)(f + g) = (S 0 T)(f) + (S 0 T)(g) = S(Tf) + T(Sg) = 0 + 0 = o. We
know that Sand T commute because they are both polynomials in D.
In order to treat products, we first have to recognize that the linear span of
all the trigonometric functions sin at, cos bt is an algebra. In other words, any
finite product of such functions is a linear combination of such functions. This
is the role of a certain class of trigonometric identities, such as 2 sin x cos y =
sin (x
y)
sin (x - y), which the reader has undoubtedly had to struggle
with. (And again the mystery disappears when we are allowed to treat them
as complex exponentials.) Then we observe that any function in the algebra a is
a finite sum of terms each of which is of the form tV t sin wt or tV t cos wt for
some i, r, and w. We can exhibit an operator T having such a function in its
null space, and our finite sum of such terms will then be in the null space of the
composition of these operators T by our first argument.
We are tempted to say one more thing. The functions ti, ert , sin wt, cos wt,
and sums of their products can be shown to be exactly the continuous functions
f: IR - IR such that the set of translates of f has a finite-dimensional span. That
is, if we define translation through x, K x, by (Kxf)(t) = f(t - x), then for
exactly the above functionsfthe linear span of {Kxf, x E IR} is finite-dimensional.
This second characterization of exactly the same class of functions cannot be
accidental. Part of the secret lies in the fact that the constant coefficient operators T are exactly those linear differential operators that commute with translation. That is, if T is a linear differential operator, then T 0 Kx = Kx 0 T for
all x if and only if T has constant coefficients. Now we have noted in an early
chapter that if To S = SoT, then the null space of T is invariant under S.
Therefore, the null space N of a constant coefficient operator T is invariant under
all translations: Kx[N] eN for all x. Now we know that N is finite-dimensional

+

+ +

6.4

THE n!l'H-ORDER LINEAR EQUATION

from our differential equation theory. Therefore, the functions in N are such
that their translates have a finite-dimensional span!
This device of gaining additional information about the null space N of a
linear operator T by finding operators S that commute with T, so that N is
S-invariant, is much used in advanced mathematics. It is especially important
when we have a group of commuting operators S, as we do in the above case with
the operators S = K",.
What we have not shown is that if a continuous function f is such that its
translation generates a finite-dimensional vector space, then f is in the null space
of some constant coefficient operator p(D). This is delicate, and it depends on
showing that if {K t } is a one-parameter family of linear transformations on a
finite-dimensional space such that K.+ t = K. 0 K t and K t --7 I as t --7 0, then
there is an S in Hom V such that K t = ets .*

5. SOLVING THE INHOMOGENEOUS EQUATION

We come now to the problem of solving the inhomogeneous equation L(f) = g.
We shall briefly describe a practical method which works easily some of the time
and a theoretical method which works all the time, but which may be hard to
apply. The latter is just the translation of Theorem 3.3 into matrix language.
We first consider the constant coefficient equation L(f) = g in the special
case where g itself is in the null space of a constant coefficient operator S. A
simple example is y' - ay = ebt (or y' - ay = sin bt), where g(t) = ebt is in the
null space of S = (D - b). In such a situation a solution f must be in the
null space of SoL, for So L(f) = S(g) = O. We know what all these functions
are, and our problem is to select f among them such that L(f) is the given g.
For the moment suppose that the polynomials Land S (polynomials in D)
have no factors in common. Then we know that L is an isomorphism on the
null space N s of S and therefore that there exists an f in N s such that Lf = g.
Since we have a basis for N s, we could construct the matrix for the action of Lon
N s and find f by solving a matrix equation, but the simplest thing to do is take
a general linear combination of the basis, with unknown coefficients, let L act
on it, and see what the coefficients must be to give g.
For example, to solve y' - ay = ebt , we try f(t) = cebt and apply
L: (D - a)(ce bt )

(b - a)ce bt J, ebt ,

=

and we see that c = 1j(b - a).
Again, to solve y' - ay = cos bt, we observe that cos bt is in the null space
of S = D2
b 2 and that this null space has the basis {sin bt, cos bt}. We
therefore set f(t) = CI sin bt C2 cos bt and solve (D - a)f = cos bt, getting

+

+

(-acI - bC2) sin bt

+ (bCI

- aC2) cos bt

=

cos bt,

-aCI - bC2 = 0,
bCI - aC2 = 1,
and
f(t) =

2

a

b b2 sin bt -

+

2

a

a b2 cos bt.

+

When Land S do have factors in common, the situation is more complicated,
but a similar procedure can be proved to work. Now an extra factor ti must be
introduced, where i is the number of occurrences of the common factor in L.
For example, in solving (D - r)2f = eTt, we have SoL = (D - r)3, and so
we must set f(t) = ct 2eTt . Our equation then becomes
(D - r)2ct 2 eTt

=

2ce Tt J, eTt,

and so C = !.
For (D 2 + 1)f = sin t we have to set f(t)
we work it out we find that CI = 0 and C2 =

= t(CI sin t + C2 cos t), and after
so that f = -!t cos t.

This procedure, called, naturally, the method of undetermined coefficients, violates our philosophy about a solution process being a linear right inverse. Indeed,
it is not a single process, applicable to any g occurring on the right, but varies
with the operator S. However, when it is available, it is the easiest way to compute explicit solutions.
We describe next a general theoretical method, called variation of parameters,
that is a right inverse to L and does therefore apply to every g. Moreover, it
inverts the general (variable coefficient) linear nth-order operator L:
(Lf)(t) =

L:" ai(t)j<i)(t).

o
We are assuming that we know the null space N of Lj that is, we assume
known n linearly independent solutions {Ui}~ of the homogeneous equation
Lf = O. What we are going to do is to translate into this context our formula

to the solution space N of the equivalent first-order system dx/dt = Tt(x), it
follows that if we have a basis {uiH for N, then the columns of the matrix
Wij = uji-ll form a basis for N.
Let wet) be the matrix Wij(t) = uji-o (t). Since evaluation at t is the isomorphism tpt from N to IR", the columns of wet) form a basis for IR", for each t.
But Kt(a) is the value at t of the solution of dx/dt = TI(x) through the initial
point -< 0, a> , and it follows that the linear transformation KI takes the columns
of the matrix w(O) to the corresponding columns of wet). The matrix for KI is
therefore wet) . w(O)-l, and the matrix form of our formula
f(t) = Ktlot (Ks)-l(g(S») ds

is therefore
f(t) = wet) . w(O)-l . lot w(O) . w(S)-l . g(s) ds.

Moreover, since integration commutes with the application of a constant linear
transformation (here multiplication by a constant matrix), the middle w(O)
factors cancel, and we have the result that

the following theorem.

This is all we shall say about the process of finding solutions. In cases where
everything works we have complete control of the solutions of L(f) = g, and
we can then solve the initial-value problem. If L has order n, then we know that
the null space N is n-dimensional, and if for a given g the function v is one
solution of the inhomogeneous equation L(f) = g, then the set of all solutions is
the n-dimensional plane (affine subspace) M = N
v. If we have found a
basis {Ui} ~ for N, then every solution of L(f) = g is of the form I = L~ CiUi v.
The initial-value problem is the problem of finding I such that L(f) = g and
l(to) = aY,,!,(t o) = ag, . .. ,!'n-l)(to) = a~, where <.aY, ... , a~>- = a O is the
given initial value. We can now find this unique I by using these n conditions
to determine the n coefficients Ci in I = L CiUi V. We get n equations in the n
unknowns Ci. Our ability to solve this problem uniquely again comes back to the
fact that the matrix Wij(t O) = uji-ll(tO) is nonsingular, as did our success in
carrying out the variation of parameters process.
We conclude this section by discussing a very simple and important example.
When a perfectly elastic spring is stretched or compressed, it resists with a
"restoring" force proportional to its deformation. If we picture a coiled spring
lying along the x-axis, with one end fixed and the free end at the origin when
undisturbed (Fig. 6.3), then when the coil is stretched a distance x (compression
being negative stretching), the force it exerts is -cx, where C is a constant representing the stiffness, or elasticity, of the spring, and the minus sign shows
that the force is in the direction opposite to the displacement. This is Hooke's

+

+

+

law.

Fig. 6.3

Suppose that we attach a point mass m to the free end of the spring, pull the
spring out to an initial position xo = a, and let go. The reader knows perfectly
well that the system will then oscillate, and we want to describe its vibration
explicitly. We disregard the InaSS of the spring itself (which amounts to adjusting m), and for the moment we suppose that friction is zero, so that the
system will oscillate forever. Newton's law says that if the force F is applied to
the mass m, then the particle will accelerate according to the equation
d2 x

Here F = -cx, so the equation combining the laws of Newton and Hooke is

where Q = v'c/m. Our initial condition was that x = a and x' = 0 when t = O.
Thus C2 = a and CI = 0, so x = a cos Qt. The particle oscillates forever
between x = -a and x = a. The maximum displacement a is called the
amplitude A of the oscillation. The number of complete oscillations per unit time
is called the frequency f, so f = Q/27r = v'C/27rVm. This is the quantitative
expression of the intuitively clear fact that the frequency will increase with the
stiffness c and decrease as the mass m increases. Other initial conditions are
equally reasonable. We might consider the system originally at rest and strike
it, so that we start with an initial velocity v and an initial displacement 0 at
time t = O. Now C2 = 0 and x = CI sin Qt. In order to evaluate Cll we remember that dx/dt = v at t = 0, and since dx/dt = CIQ cos Qt, we have v = CIQ
and CI = v/Q, the amplitude for this motion. In general, the initial condition
would be x = a and x' = v when t = 0, and the unique solution thus determined
would involve both terms of the general solution, with amplitude to be calculated.
The situation is both more realistic and more interesting when friction is
taken into account. Frictional resistance is ideally a force proportional to the
velocity dx/ dt but again with a negative sign, since its direction is opposite to
that of the motion. Our new equation is thus
d2x
m dt 2

+ k dx
dt + cx =

0,

and we know that the system will act in quite different ways depending on the
relationship among the constants m, k, and c. The reader will be asked to explore
these equations further in the exercises.
It is extraordinary that exactly the same equation governs a freely oscillating
electric circuit. It is now written
d2x

where L, R, and C are the inductance, resistance, and capacitance of the circuit,
respectively, and dx/dt is the current. However, the ordinary operation of such
a circuit involves forced rather than free oscillation. An alternating (sinusoidal)
voltage is applied as an extra, external, "force" term, and the equation is now

This shows the most interesting behavior of alL Using the method of undetermined coefficients, we find that the solution contains transient terms that

called phase and resonance now appear, as the reader will discover in the exercises.

6. THE BOUNDARY-VALUE PROBLEM

We now turn to a problem which seems to be like the initial-value problem but
which turns out to be of a wholly different character. Suppose that T is a secondorder operator, which we consider over a closed interval [a, b]. Some of the most
important problems in physics require us to find solutions to T(f) = g such that
f has given values at a and b, instead of f and l' having given values at a single
point to. This new problem is called a boundary-value problem, because {a, b} is
the boundary of the domain I = [a, b]. The boundary-value problem, like the
initial-value problem, breaks neatly into two subproblems if the set
M = {j E

e 2 ([a,

b]) : f(a) = f(b) = O}

turns out to be a complement of the null space N of T. However, if the reader
will consider this general question for a moment, he will realize that he doesn't
have a clue to it from our initial-value development, and, in fact, wholly new
tools have to be devised.
Our procedure will be to forget that we are trying to solve the boundaryvalue problem and instead to speculate on the nature of a linear differential

6.6

THE BOUNDARY-VALUE PROBLEM

operator T from the point of view of scalar products and the theory of selfadjoint operators. That is, our present study of T will be by means of the scalar
product (f, g) =
f(t)g(t) dt, the general problem being the usual one of
solving Tf = g by finding a right inverse S of T. Also, as usual, S may be determined by finding a complement M of N(T). Now, however, it turns out that if T
is "formally self-adjoint", then suitable choices of M will make the associated
right inverses S self-adjoint and compact, and the eigenvectors of S, computed as
those solutions of the homogeneous equation Tf - rf = 0 which lie in M, then
allow (relatively) the same easy handling of S, by virtue of Theorem 5.1 of
Chapter 5, that they gave us earlier in the finite-dimensional situation.
We first consider the notion of "formal adjoint" for an nth-order linear
differential operator T. The ordinary formula for integration by parts,

J:

allows the derivatives of f occurring in the scalar product (Tf, g) to be shifted
one at a time to g. At the end, f is undifferentiated and g is acted on by a certain
nth-order linear differential operator R. The endpoint evaluations, like the
above fgl~, that accumulate step by step can be described as
B(f, g)l: =

L

kij(x)f(i)(x)g<il(x)l:,

O"':i+j<n

where the coefficient functions kij(x) are linear combinations of the coefficient
functions ai(x) and their derivatives. Thus
(Tf, g) = (f, Rg)

+ B(f, g)l~.

The operator R is called the formal adJ·oint of T, and if R
formally self-adjoint.

=

T, we say that T is

Every application of the integration by parts formula introduces a sign
change, and the reader may be able to see that the leading coefficient of R is
(-1) n times the leading coefficient of T. Assuming this, we see that a necessary
condition for formal self-adjointness is that n be even, so that Rand T have the
same first terms.
Supposing that T is formally self-adjoint, we seek a complement M of the
null space N of T in en([a, b]) with the further property that S, the associated
right inverse of T, is self-adjoint as a mapping from the pre-Hilbert space
eO([a, b]) to itself. Let us see what this further requirement amounts to. For
any u, v E eO, set f = Su and g = Sv, so that f and g are in M and u = Tf,
v = Tg.
Then (u, Sv) = (Tf, g) = (f, Tg) + B(f, g)l~ = (Su, v) + B(f, g)l~.
We thus have:

Under any of conditions (1), (2), or (4), cd'jJ! = 0, and the two integral terms
are clearly bounded below by mllf'll~ and Ilfll~, respectively. Lemma 6.3 then
implies that !vI is a complement of the null space of T - "A. 0
We come now to our main theorem. It says that the right inverse S of T - "A
determined by the subspace !vI above is a compact self-adjoint mapping of the
pre-Hilbert space eO([a, b]) into itself, and is therefore endowed with all the rich
eigenvalue structures of Theorem 5.1 of the last chapter. First we present some
classical terminology. A Sturm-Liouville system on [a, b] is a formally self-adjoint
cof defined over the closed
second-order differential operator Tf = (cd')'
interval [a, b], together with a self-adjoint boundary ~ondition II (f) = l2(f) = 0
for that interval. If C2(t) is never zero on [a, b], the system is called regular. If
c2(a) or c2(b) is zero, or if the interval [a, b] is replaced by an infinite interval
such as [a, 00], then the system is called singular.

+

T: l1, l2 is a regular Sturm-Liouville system on [a, b], with
positive, then the subspace !vI defined by the homogeneous boundary
condition is a complement of N(T - "A) if "A is taken sufficiently large, and
the right inverse of T - "A thus determined by !vI is a compact self-adjoint
mapping of the pre-Hilbert space eO([a, b]) into itself.

Proof. The proof depends on the inequality of the above lemma. Since we have
proved this inequality only for boundary conditions (1), (2), and.(4), our proof
will be complete only for those cases.
Set g = (T - "A)f. Since IIgl1211fl12 ~ I((T - "A)f,f)1 by the Schwarz

We have already checked that the right inverse S of the formally selfadjoint T - "A defined by !vI is self-adjoint, and it remains for us to show that the
set S[U] = {f: IIgl12 ::; 1} has compact closure. For any such f the Schwarz
inequality and the above inequality imply that

Thus S[U] is uniformly equicontinuous. Since the common domain of the
functions in S[U] is the compact set [a, b], we will be able to conclude from
Theorem 6.1 of Chapter 4 that the set S[U] is totally bounded if we can show
that there is a constant C such that all the functions in S[U] have their ranges in
[-C, C]. Taking y and x in the last inequality where If I assumes its maximum

(min Ifl)(b - a)1/2 ::;;

Thus S[U] is a uniformly equicontinuous set of functions mapping the compact set [a, b] into the compact set [-e, e], and is therefore totally bounded in
the uniform norm. Since e([a, b]) is complete in the uniform norm, every sequence
in S[ U] has a subsequence uniformly converging to some fEe, and since
IIfll2 ::;; (b - a)1/21Ifll"" this subsequence also converges to f in the two-norm.
We have thus shown that if H is the pre-Hilbert space e([a, b]) under the
standard scalar product, then the image S[U] of the unit ball U C H under S has
the property that every sequence in S[U] has a subsequence converging in H.
This is the property we actually used in proving Theorem 5.1 of Chapter 5, but
it is not quite the definition of the compactness of S, which requires us to show
that the closure S[U] is compact in H. However, if {~n} is any sequence in this
closure, then we can choose {Sn} in S[U] so that II~n - snll < l/n. The sequence {s n} has a convergent subsequence {s n(m)} m as above, and then {~n(m)} m
converges to the same limit. Thus S is a compact operator. 0
There exists an orthonormal sequence {<Pn} consisting entirely
of eigenvectors of T and forming a basis for M. Moreover, the Fourier
expansion of any f E M with respect to the basis {<Pn} converges uniformly
to f (as well as in the two-norm).

Theorelll 6.2.

Proof. By Theorem 5.1 of Chapter 5 there exist an eigenbasis for the range of S,
which is M. Since S<Pn = 1'n<Pn for some nonzero rn, we have (T - X)(rn<Pn) =
<Pn and T<Pn = (1
Xrn)/rn)<Pn' The uniformity of the series convergence
comes out of the following general consideration.

+

Lelllllla 6.5. Suppose that T is a self-adjoint operator on a pre-Hilbert
space V and that T is compact as a mapping from V to -< V, q>- , where q is a
second norm on V that dominates the scalar product norm p (q 2:: cp).
Then T is compact (from p to p), and the eigenbasis expansion L bn<Pn of an
element {3 in the range of T converges to {3 in both norms.

Proof. Let U be the unit ball of V in the scalar product norm. By the hypothesis
of the lemma, the q-closure B of T[U] is compact. B is then also p-compact, for
any sequence in it has a q-convergent subsequence which also p-converges to the
same limit, because p ::;; cq. We can therefore apply the eigenbasis theorem.
Now let a and (3 = T(a) have the Fourier series L ai<Pi and L bi<Pi, and let
T(<Pi) = ri<Pi.
Then bi = riai, because bi = (T(a), <Pi) = (a, T(<Pi)) =
(a, ri<Pi) = ri(a, <Pi) = riai. Since the sequence of partial sums L~ ai<Pi is
p-bounded (Bessel's inequality), the sequence {L~ bi<Pi} = {T(L:~ ai<Pi)} is
totally q-bounded. Any subsequence of it therefore has a subsubsequence
q-converging to some element 'Y in V. Since it then p-converges to 'Y, 'Y must be {3.
Thus every subsequence has a subsubsequence q-converging to {3, and so
{L~ bi<Pi} itself q-converges to {3 by Lemma 4.1 of Chapter 4. 0

There are not many regular Sturm-Liouville systems whose associated orthonormal eigenbases have proved to be important in actual calculations. Most
orthonormal bases that are used, such as those due to Bessel, Legendre, Hermite,

beyond the limitations we have set for this discussion. However, the most wellknown example, Fourier series, is available to us.

C2C-rx is 0 at both 0 and 7r, then CI = C2 = 0 (because the pairs -< 1, 1>- and
-< cT1r , c- T1r >- are independent). Therefore, there are no solutions satisfying the
boundary conditions when}.. > O. If}.. = 0, then f(x) = CIX
Co and again
CI = Co = O.
If }.. < 0, then the solution space is spanned by {sin rx, cos rx}, where
r = (_}..) 1/2. Now if C1 sin rx
C2 cos rx is 0 at x = 0 and x = 7r, we get,
first, that C2 = 0 and, second, that r7r = n7r for some integer n. Thus the
eigenfunctions for the first system form the set {sin nx} f, and the corresponding
eigenvalues of D2 are {-n 2} f.
At the end of this section we shall prove that the functions in ~2([a, b])
that are zero near a and b are dense in ~([a, b]) in the two-norm. Assuming this,
it follows from Theorem 2.3 of Chapter 5 that a basis for M is a basis for ~o, and
we now have the following corollary of the Sturm-Liouville theorem.

TheoreD1 7.1. The sequence {sin nx}f is an orthogonal basis for the pre-

Hilbert space ~O([O, 7r]). If f E ~2([0, 7r]) and f(O) = f(7r) = 0, then the
Fourier series for f converges uniformly to f.
We now consider the second boundary problem. The computations are a
little more complicated, but again if f(x) = CIC rx
C2C-rx, and if f( -7r) = f(7r)
and 1'( -7r) = f'(7r), then f = O. For now we have

giving CI (eT'lr - e- r ll") = 0, and so CI = o. Again f(x) = CIX

Theorem 7.2. The set {sin nx} ~ U {cos nx} 0 forms an orthogonal basis for
the pre-Hilbert space e O([ -7r, 7r]). If f E e 2 ([ -7r, 7r)) and f( -7r) = f(7r),
1'( -7r) = f'(7r), then the Fourier series for f converges to f uniformly on
[-7r,7r).
Remaining proof. This theorem follows from our general Sturm-Liouville discussion except for the orthogonality of sin nx and cos nx. We have
(sin nx, cos nx)

= f~lI" sin nt cos nt dt
= t f~" sin 2nt dt
= -(1/4n) cos 2nx)~1I"
= o.

Or we can simply remark that the first integrand is an odd function and therefore
its integral over any symmetric interval [-a, a) is necessarily zero.
The orthogonality of eigenvectors having different eigenvalues follows of
course, as in the proof of Theorem 3.1 of Chapter 5. 0
Finally, we prove the density theorem we needed above. There are very
slick ways of doing this, but they require more machinery than we have available, and rather than taking the time to make the machines, we shall prove the
theorem with our bare hands.
It is standard notation to let a subscript zero on a symbol denoting a class
of functions pick out those functions in the class that are zero "on the boundary"
in some suitable sense. Here eo([a, b)) will denote the functions in e([a, bJ) that
are zero in neighborhoods of a and b, and similarly for e~([a, b)).
Theorem 7.3. e 2 ([a, b)) is dense in e([a, b)) in the uniform norm, and
e6([a, b)) is dense in e([a, b)) in the two-norm.
Proof. We first approximate f E e([a, b)) to within E by a piecewise "linear"
function g by drawing straight line segments between the adjacent points on the
graph of f lying over a subdivision a = Xo < Xl < ... < Xn = b of [a, bJ.
If f varies by less than E on each interval (Xi-I, Xi), then Ilf - all"" :::; E. Now
a' (t) is a step function which is constant on the intervals of the above subdivision. We now alter g'(t) slightly near each jump in such a way that the new
function h(t) is continuous there. If we do it as sketched in Fig. 6.5, the total

integral error at the jump is zero, I:.0:,,& (h - g') = 0, and the maximum error
I:''-a is 611/4. This will be less than Eif we take 6 = E/llg'II"" since 11 ~ 21Ig'II",.
We now have a continuous function h such that II: h(t) dt - (J(x) - I(a)) I < 2E.
In other words, we have approximated I uniformly by a continuously differentiable function.
Now choose g and h in e1([a, b)) so that first III - gil", < E/2 and then
IIg' - hll", < E/2(b - a). Then
Ig(x) - g(O) -

10'" hi < E/2,

+

and so H(x) = fO' h g(O) is a twice continuously differentiable function such
that III - HII", < E. In other words, e 2«(a, b)) is dense in e([a, b]) in the
uniform norm. It is then also dense in the two-nonn, since

11/112 =

(ib12y/2 ~ 1I/1I",(i 1r/ 2 =
b

(b -

a)1/211/11",.

But now we can do something which we couldn't do for the uniform norm:
we can alter the approximating function to one that is zero on neighborhoods of a
and b, and keep the two-norm approximation good. Given 6, let e(t) be a nonnegative function on [a, b] such that e(t) = 1 on [a 26, b - 26], e(t) = 0 on
la, a
6] and on [b - 0, b], e" is continuous, and lIell", = 1. Such an e(t) clearly
exists, since we can draw it. We leave it as an interesting exercise to actually
define e(t). Here is a hint: Show somehow that there is a fifth-degree polynomial
pet} having a graph between 0 and 1 as shown in Fig. 6.6, with a zero second
derivative at 0 and at 1, and then use a piece of the graph, suitably translated,
compressed, rotated, etc., to help patch together e(t).
Anyway, then IIg - egl12 ~ IIgll",,(46)1/2 for any g on e([a, b)), and if g has
continuous derivatives up to order 2, then so does ego Thus, if we start with I in e
and approximate it by gin e 2 , and then approximate g by eg, we have altogether
the second approximation of the theorem. 0

MULTILINEAR FUNCTIONALS

This chapter is principally for reference. Although most of the proofs will be
included, the reader is not expected to study them. Our goal is a collection of
basic theorems about alternating multilinear functionals, or exterior forms, and
the determinant function is one of our rewards.
1. BILINEAR FUNCTIONALS

We have already studied various aspects of bilinear functionals. We looked at
their duality implications in Section 6, Chapter 1, we considered the "canonical
forms" of symmetric bilinear functionals and their equivalent quadratic forms
in Section 7, Chapter 2, and, of course, the whole scalar product theory of
Chapter 5 is the theory of a still more special kind of bilinear functional. In this
chapter we shall restrict ourselves to bilinear and multilinear functionals over
finite-dimensional spaces, and our concerns are purely algebraic.
We begin with some material related to our earlier algebra. If V and Ware
finite-dimensional vector spaces, then the set of all bilinear functionals on
V X W is pretty clearly a vector space. We designate it V* ® W* and call it
the tensor product of V* and W*. Our first theorem simply states something
that was implicit in Theorem 6.1 of Chapter 1.
TheoreIn 1.1. The vector spaces V* ® W*, Hom(V, W*), and Hom(W, V*)
are naturally isomorphic.

Proof. We saw in Theorem 6.1 of Chapter 1 that eachfin V* ® W* determines
a linear mapping a 1--+ fa from W to V*, wherefa(t) = f(t, a), and we also noted
that this correspondence from V* ® W* to Hom(W, V*) is bijective. All that
the present theorem adds is that this bijective correspondence is linear and so
constitutes a natural isomorphism, as does the similar one from V* ® W* to
Hom(V, W*). To see this, leth be the bilinear functional corresponding to Tin
Hom(V, W*). Then f(T+S) = h
fs, for f(T+S)(a, (3) = (T
S)(a))({3) =
(T(a)
S(a))({3) = (T(a))({3)
(S(a))({3) = h(a, (3)
fs(a, (3).
We can
do the same for homogeneity.
The isomorphism of V* ® W* with Hom(W, V*) follows in exactly the
same way by reversing the roles of the variables. We are thus finished with the
proof. D

7.2

MULTILINEAR FUNCTIONALS

Before looking for bases in V* Q9 W*, we define a bilinear functional 'Y Q9 A
for any two functionals 'Y E V* and A E W* by ('Y Q9 A)(~, '1/) = 'Y(~)A('1/).
We call 'Y Q9 A the tensor product of the functionals 'Y and Aand call any bilinear
functional having this form elementary. It is not too hard to see thatf E V* Q9 W*
is elementary if and only if the corresponding T E Hom(V, W*) is a dyad.
If V and Ware finite-dimensional, with dimensions m and n, respectively,
then the above isomorphism of V* Q9 W* with Hom(V, W*) shows that the
dimension of V* Q9 W* is mn. We now describe the basis determined by given
bases in V and W.
Theorem 1.2. Let {ai}'{' and {{jiH be any bases for V and W, and let their
dual bases in V* and W* be {Mi}'{' and {viH. Then the mn elementary
bilinear functionals {Mi Q9 Vi} form the corresponding basis for V* Q9 W*.
Proof· Since Mi Q9 Vi(~' '1/)
Li,i tiixiYi becomes f(~, '1/)

MiWVi('1/) = xiYb the matrix expansionf(~, '1/)
Li,i tii(Mi Q9 Vi)(~' '1/) or

i,i

=

The set {Mi Q9 Vi} thus spans V* Q9 W*. Since it contains the same number of
elements (mn) as the dimension of V* Q9 W*, it forms a basis. 0
Of course, independence can also be checked directly. If Li,i tii(Mi Q9 Vi) =
0, then for every pair -<k, l>, tkl = Li,i tii(Mi Q9 Vi) (ak' (jl) = O.
We should also remark that this theorem is entirely equivalent to our
discussion of the basis for Hom(V, W) at the end of Section 4, Chapter 2.

We change notation, just as we do in replacing the traditional -<x, y> E 1R2 by

a = -<al,"" an> E VI X ... X V n. Our requirement now is that
f(all . .. , an)

be a linear functional of ai when ai is held fixed for all i :;z!! i. The set of all such
functionals is a vector space, called the tensor product of the dual spaces
Vr, ... , V:, and is designated
Q9 ... Q9 V:.
As before, there are natural isomorphims between these tensor product
spaces and various Hom spaces. For example,

not encountered in the bilinear case. However, it will not be necessary for us to
look into these questions.
We define elementary multilinear functionals as before. If Ai E vt, i =
1, ... , n, and E = -< h, ... , ~n >- , then

To keep our notation as simple as possible, and also because it is the case of
most interest to us, we shall consider the question of bases only when VI =
V 2 = ... = V n = V. In this case (V*)® = V* (8) ... (8) V* (in factors) is
called the space of covariant tensors of order n (over V).
If {aj}i is a basis for V and! E (V*)®, then we can eXlJand the value
!(E) = !(h, ... , ~n) with respect to the basis expansions of the vectors ~i just
as we did when! was bilinear, but now the result is notationally more complex.
If we set ~i = Li!=l x}aj for i = 1, ... , n (so that the coordinate set of ~i is
xi = {xJ} j) and use the linearity of the!(h, ... , ~n) in its separate variables one
variable at a time, we get
!(~l' ... , ~n) =

L

X!lX;2 ... x;J(aplI a p2, ... , a pn),

where the sum is taken over all n-tuples p = -< PI, ... , Pn >- such that 1 .:::; Pi .:::;
m for each i from 1 to m. The set of all these n-tuples is just the set of all functions from {I, ... , n} to {I, ... ,m}. We have designated this set mn , using the
notation n = {I, ... , n}, and the scope of the above sum can thus be indicated
in the formula as follows:
!(h, ... , ~n)

=

I:

X!l··· x;J(ap1 , ... , a pn)·

PEm1'

A strict proof of this formula would require an induction on n, and is left to the
interested reader. At the inductive step he wilt have to rewrite a double sum
LpE;nii LjEm as the single sum LqEm n+l using the fact that an ordered pair
-<p, j>- in mn X m is equivalent to an (n + 1)-tuplet q E mn+t, where qi = Pi
for i = 1, ... , nand qn+l = j.
If {,ui}i is the dual basis for V* and q E mn, let,uq be the elementary functional,uql (8) ... (8) ,uqn· Thus ,uq(apII ... , apJ = ll1,uqi(ap) = 0. unless p = q,
in which case its value is 1. More generally,
}Lq(h, ... , ~n) = ,uql (h) ... ,uqn (~n) = X!l ... x~n·
Therefore, if we set cq = !(a q1 , • .. , a qn ), the general expansion now appears as

f(~b ... , ~n)

I:

CP,uP(~l' ... ' ~n)

or! = L ~, which is the same formula we obtained in the bilinear case, but
with more sophisticated notation. The functionals {,up: p E mn} thus span
(V*)®. They are also independent. For, if L Cp,lLp = 0., then for each q,
cq = L cp,lLp(a q1 , ... , aqJ = 0.. We have proved the following theorem.

3. PERMUTATIONS

A permutation on a set S is a bijection f: S - t S. If S(S) is the set of all permutations on S, then S = S(S) is closed under composition (u, pES = } u 0 pES)
and inversion (u E S = } u- I E S). Also, the identity map I is in S, and, of course,
the composition operation is associative. Together these statements say exactly
that S is a group under composition. The simplest kind of permutation other
than I is one which interchanges a pair of elements of S and leaves every other
element fixed. Such a permuation is called a transposition.
We now take S to be the finite set n = {I, ... ,n} and set Sn = Sen).
I t is not hard to see that then any permutation can be expressed as a product of
transpositions, and in more than one way.
A more elementary fact that we shall need is that if p is a fixed element of Sn,
then the mapping u I---t u 0 p is a bijection Sn I---t Sn. It is surjective because
any u' can be written u' = (u' 0 p-I) 0 p, and it is injective because UI 0 P =
U2 0 P = } (UI 0 p) 0 p-I = (U2 0 p) 0 p-l = } Ul = U2. Similarly, the mapping
U I---t P 0 U (p fixed) is bijective.
We also need the fact that there are n! elements in Sn. This is the elementary count from secondary school algebra. In defining an element U E Sn,
u(I) can be chosen in n ways. For each of these choices u(2) can be chosen in
n - 1 ways, so that -<u(I), u(2) >- can be chosen in n(n - 1) ways. For each of
these choices u(3) can be chosen in n - 2 ways, etc. Altogether u can be chosen
in n(n - I)(n - 2) ... 1 = n! ways.
In the sequel we shall often write 'pu' instead of 'p 0 u', just as we occasionally wrote 'ST' instead of'S 0 T' for the composition of linear maps.
If ~ = -< ~b ... , ~n >- E vn andu E Sn, then we can "apply u to ~", or "permute the elements of -< ~I' . . . ' ~n>- through u". We mean, of course, that
we can replace -< h, ... , ~n >- by -< ~.. (1}, ••• , ~.. (n) >-, that is, we can replace ~
by ~ 0 u.
Permuting the variables changes a functional f E (V*)@ into a new such
functional. Specifically, given f E (V*)@ and u E Sn, we define by

r

rw = fa

u- I )

= fa..-I(}), ... , ~cr-I(n».

The reason for using u- 1 instead of u is, in part, that it gives us the following
formula.

Theorem 3.1. For each u in Sn the mapping Ttl defined by f f-+ r is a linear
isomorphism of (V*)@ onto itself. The mapping u f-+ Ttl is an antihomomorphism from the group Sn to the group of nonsingular elements of
Hom(V*)®).
Proof. Permuting the variables does not alter the property of multilinearity, so
Ttl maps (V*)® into itself. It is linear, since (af + bg)tI = ar + bgtl . And
Tptl = Ttl 0 Tp, becausef'tI = (f't. Thusu f-+ Ttl preserves products, but in the
reverse order. This is why it is called an antihomomorphism. Finally,

so that Ttl is invertible (nonsingular, an isomorphism). 0
The mapping u f-+ Ttl is a representation (really an antirepresentation) of the
group Sn by linear transformations on (V*)®.
Lemma 3.2. Each Ttl carries the basis {J.!p} into itself, and so is a permutation on the basis.
Proof. We have (J.!p)tI(l;) = J.!p(1; 0 u- 1) = II~=1 J.!Pi(~tI-l(i»' Settingj = u- 1 (i)
and so having i = u(j), this product can be rewritten IIi=l J.!p"r.;)(~j) = J.!potl(I;).

4. THE SIGN OF A PERMUTATION

We consider now the special polynomial E on
E(x) = E(X1, ... , xn) =

~n

II

defined by
(Xi - Xj).

l~i<j~n

This is the product over all pairs -< i, j>- E n X n such that i < j. This set of
ordered pairs is in one-to-one correspondence with the collection P of all pair
sets {i, j} en such that i ~ j, the ordered pair being obtained from the unordered pair by putting it in its natural order. Now it is clear that for any
permutation u E Sn, the mapping {i, j} f-+ {u(i), u(j)} is a permutation of P.
This means that the factors in the polynomial EtI(x) = E(x 0 u) are exactly the
same as in the polynomial E(x) except for the changes of sign that occur when u
reverses the order of a pair. Therefore, if n is the number of these reversals, we
have Etl = (-1)nE. The mapping u f-+ (-I)n is designated 'sgn' (and called
"sign"). Thus sgn is a function from Sn to {I, -I} such that Etl = (sgnu)E,

Also
sgner = -1
if er is a transposition.
This is clear if er interchanges adjacent numbers because it then changes th(~
sign of just one factor in E(x); we leave the general case as an exercise for the
interested reader.

p 0 U = p, cp = (sgn u)cpocr = -cp , and so cp = o. Since no p can be injective
if n > m, we see that in this case the only element of an is the zero functional.
Thus n > m =} dim an = o.
Now suppose that n :::; m. For any injective p, the set {p 0 U : U E Sn}
consists of all the (injective) n-tuples with the same range set as p. There are
clearly n! of them. Exactly one q = po U counts off the range set in its natural
order, i.e., satisfies ql < q2 < ... < qn. We select this unique q as the representative of all the elements p 0 U having this range. The collection C of these
canonical (representative) q's is thus in one-to-one correspondence with the
collection of all (range) subsets of m = {I, ... , m} of size n.
Each injective p E m,'ii is uniquely expressible as p = q 0 U for some q E C,
U E Sn. Thus each 1 in an is the sum LqEC LcrESn tqocrJJ,qocr. Since tqocr = (sgn u)tq,
this sum can be rewritten LqEC tq Lcr (sgn u)JJ,qocr = LqEC tqVq, where we have
Het Vq = Lcr (sgn u)JJ,qo(J' = n!Q(JJ,q).
We are just about done. Each Vq is alternating, since it is in the range of Q,
and the expansion

which we have just found to be valid for every 1 E an shows that the set
{vq : q E C} spans an. It is also independent, since LqEC tqVq = LpEmfi tpJJ,p
and the set {JJ,p} is independent. It is therefore a basis for an.
Now the total number of injective mappings p from n = {I, ... ,n} to
m = {I, ... ,m} is m(m - 1) ... (m - n 1), for the first element can be
chosen in m ways, the second in m - 1 ways, and so on down through n choices,
the last element having m - (n - 1) = m - n
1 possibilities. We have seen
above that the number of these p's with a given range is n!. Therefore, the

6. THE DETERMINANT

We saw in Section 5 that the dimension of the space am of alternating m-forms
over an m-dimensional V is (:) = 1. Thus, to within scalar multiples there is only
one alternating m-linear functional D over V = IR m , and we can adjust th(~
constant so that D(al, ... , am) = 1. This uniquely determined m-form is th(~
determinanifunctional, and its value D(xl, ... , xm) at the m-tuple -<Xl, ••• ,xm>is the determinant of the matrix x = {Xij} whoseJth column is x j for J = 1, ... , m.

Now let dim V = m, and letfbe any nonzero alternating m-form on V. For
any T in Hom V the functionalh defined by h(~l' ... , ~n) = f(T~l' ... , T~n)
also belongs to am. Since am is one-dimensional, h = krf for some constant k T .
Moreover, kT is independent of i, since if gT = kT' g and g = ci, we must havp
ch = kT' ci and kT' = k T. This unique constant is called the determinant of T;
we shall designate it !leT). Note that !leT) is defined independently of any basi::;

Proof. If f is any nonzero alternating m-form on W, and if we define g by
(J(h, ... , ~n) = f«(J~1l ... ,(J~n)' Then g is a nonzero alternating m-form on V.
Now f(S 0 (J~1l . . . ,S 0 (J~n) = fl.(S)f«(J~, ... , (J~n) = fl.(S)g(h, ... , ~n)'

The reader will expect the two notions of determinant we have introduced
to agree; we prove this now.
Corollary 1. If t is the matrix of T with respect to some basis in V, then

Proof. If (J is the coordinate isomorphism, then T = (J 0 To (J-I is in Hom IRm
and fl.(T) = fl.(T) by the theorem. Also, the columns of t are the m-tuple
T(OI), ... ,T(om). Thus D(t) = D(t\ ... , t m) = D(T(OI), ... , T(om)) =
b.(T) D(oI, ... , om) = fl.(T). Altogether we have D(t) = fl.(T). 0

linear combination of the others, tl = L;' Cit;, and D(tIl"" t m ) =

lit-tuple having two identical elements, and so is 0 by the alternating property. 0

L:;' c;D(ti, t2, ... , t m)

We still have to show that fl. has all the properties we ascribed to it in
Chapter 2. Some of them are in hand. We know that fl.(S 0 T) = fl.(S) fl.(T),
ILnd the one- and two-dimensional properties are trivial. Thus, if T interchanges
independent vectors al and a2 in a two-dimensional space, then its matrix with
respect to them as a basis is t = [~ Al, and so fl.(T) = D(t) = -1.
The following lemma will complete the job.
Lemma 6.2. Consider D(t) = D(t \ ... , t m) under the special assumption
that t m = om. If s is the (m - 1) X (m - 1) matrix obtained from the
m X m matrix t by deleting its last row and last column, then D(s) = D(t).

314

7.n

MULTILINEAR FUNCTIONALS

Proof. This can be made to follow from an inspection of the formula of LemmlL
6.1, but we shall argue directly.
If t has om also as its jth column for some j ~ m, then of course D(t) = (I
by the alternating property. This means that D(t) is unchanged if thejth columll
is altered in the mth place, and therefore D(t) depends only on the values iij ill
the rows i ~ m. That is, D(t) depends only on s. Now t ~ s is clearly a Slll'jective mapping to ~m-lXm-l, and, as a function of s, D(t) is alternatill~
(m - I)-linear. It therefore is a constant multiple of the determinant I)
on ~(m-l)X(m-l). To see what the constant is, we evaluate at

Then D(s) = 1 = D(t) for this special choice, and so D(s) = D(t) in general. [[
In order to get a hold on the remaining two properties, we consider all
m X m matrix t whose last m - n columns are on+ 1, .•• , om, and we apply
the above lemma repeatedly. We have, first, D(t) = D(t)mm), where (t)1II111
is the (m - 1) X (m - 1) matrix obtained from t by deleting the last rowalHl
the last column. Since this matrix has om-l as its last column (om-l being no\\'
an (m - I)-tuple), the same argument shows that its determinant is the salll('
as that of the (m - 2) X (m - 2) matrix obtained from it in the same way.
We can keep on going as long as the o-columns last, and thus see that D(t) is tll(·
determinant of the n X n matrix that is the upper left corner of t. If we interpret
this in terms of transformations, we have the following lemma.
Lenuna 6.3. 3uppose that V is m-dimensional and that T in Hom V iH

Proof. Let ar, ... , an be a basis for Y, and let an+r, ... , am be a basis for X.
Then {ai}'{' is a basis for V, and since T(ai) = ai for i = n
1, ... , m, til!'
matrix for T has oi as its ith column for i = n
1, ... ,m. The lemma will
therefore follow from our above discussion if we can show that the matrix of
po (T f Y) in Hom Y is the n X n upper left corner of t. The student should
be able to see this if he visualizes what vector (p 0 T)(ai) is for i ::;; n. D

I[

If the roles of X and Yare interchanged, both being invariant under T and
T being the identity on Y, then this same lemma tells us that Ll(T) = Llx(T

f X).

If we only know that X and Yare T-invariant, then we can factor T into

II

commuting product T = T loT 2 = T 2 0 T r, where T 1 and T 2 are of the two
more special types discussed above, and so have the rule Ll(T) = Ll(T 1 ) Ll(T 2 ) =
Llx(T f X) Lly(T f V), another of our properties listed in Chapter 2.

7.6

THE DETERMINANT

The final rule is also a consequence of the above lemma. If T is the identity
on X and also on V IX, then it isn't too hard to see that po (T f Y) is the
identity, as an element of Hom Y, and so A(T) = 1 by the lemma.
We now prove the theorem concerning "expansion by minors (or cofactors)".
Let t be an m X m matrix, and let (t)pr be the (m - 1) X (m - 1) submatrix
obtained from t by deleting the pth row and rth column. Then,
6.3. D(t) = L:i"=1 (-l)i+rtir D(t)ir). That is, we can evaluate
D(t) by going down the rth column, multiplying each element by the
determinant of the (m - 1) X (m - 1) matrix associated with it, and
Theorem

adding. The two occurrences of 'D' in the theorem are of course over dimensions m and m - 1, respectively.
Proof. Consider D(t) = D(tl, ... ,tm) under the special assumption that
op. Since D(t) is an alternating linear functional both of the columns of t
and of the rows of t, we can move the rth column and pth row to the right-

e=

bottom border, and apply Lemma 6.2. Thus
D(t)

= (_l)m-r(_l)m-p D(e r) = (-l)P+ rD(e r),

assuming that the rth column of t is or. In general, e = L:i"=1 tir oi, and if we
expand D(t t, ... , t m) with respect to this sum in the rth place, and if we use the
above evaluation of the separate terms of the resulting sum, we get D(t) =
L:i"=1 (_l)i+r tir D(t)ir. 0
Corollary 1. If S ~ r,

then

L:i"=1

(-l)i+rti. D(t)ir)

= o.

Proof. We now have the expansion of the theorem for a matrix with identicalsth
and rth columns, and the determinant of this matrix is zero by the alternating
property. 0

For simpler notation, set Cij = (-l)i+j D (t)ij). This is called the cofactor
of the element tij in t. Our two results together say that
m

L:

Cirti. = o~ D(t).

i=1

In particular, if D(t) ~ 0, then the matrix s whose entries are Sri = Cir/ D(t) is
the inverse of t. This observation gives us a neat way to express the solution of
a system of linear equations. We want to solve t . x = y for x in terms of y,
supposing that D(t) ~ O. Since s is the inverse of t, we have x = s' y. That is,
Xj = L:i"=1 SjiYi = (L:i"=1 YiCij)/ D(t) for J = 1, ... ,m. According to our
expansion theorem, the numerator in this expression is exactly the determinant
dj of the matrix obtained from t by replacing its Jth column by the m-tuple y.
Hence, with d j defined this way, the solution to t . x = y is the m-tuple

This is Cramer's rule. It was stated in slightly different notation in Section 2.5.

TheoreUl 7.3. Let () be the alternating n-linear map

from (v*)n to an. Then for any alternating n-linearfunctional F(AI' ... ,An)
on (v*)n, there is a uniquely determined linear functional G on an such that
F = Go e. The mapping G f---t F is thus a canonical isomorphism from
(an) * to an(V*).
Proof. The straightforward way to prove this is to define G by establishing its
necessary values on a basis, using the equation F = Go e, and then to show
from the linearity of G, the alternating multilinearity of

and the alternating multilinearity of F that the identity F = Go () holds
everywhere. This computation becomes notationally complex. Instead, we shall
be devious. We shall see that by proving more than the theorem asserts we get
a shorter proof of the theorem.
We consider the space an(V*) of all alternating n-linear functions on (v*)n.
We know from Theorem 5.2 that d(an(V*» = C;;'), since d(V*) = d(V) = m.

318

MULTILINEAR FUNCTIONALS

7.7

Now for each functional Gin (a n )*, the functional Go e is alternating and ulinear, and so G;-+ F = Go e is a mapping from (a n)* to an(v*) which is
clearly linear. Moreover it is injective, for if G ~ 0, then F(fJ-q(l), ... , fJ-q(n)) =
G(Vq) ~ 0 for some basis vector Vq = fJ-q(1) 1\ ... 1\ fJ-q(n) of an(v*). Sincp
d(an(V*) = ('::) = dean) = d(a n)*), the mapping is an isomorphism (by
the corollary of Theorem 2.4, Chapter 2). In particular, every F in an(v*) i::;
of the form Go e. 0

It can be shown further that the property asserted in the above theorem is
an abstract characterization of an. By this we mean the following. Suppose that
a vector space X and an alternating mapping cp from (v*)n to X are given, and
suppose that every alternating functional F on (v*)n extends uniquely to it
linear functional G on X (that is, F = Go cp). Then X is isomorphic to an, and
in such a way that cp becomes e.
To see this we simply note that the hypothesis of unique extensibility is
exactly the hypothesis that <I>: G;-+ F = Go cp is an isomorphism from X* to
an(v*). The theorem gave an isomorphism 8 from (a n)* to an(v*), and the
adjoint (<I>-1 0 8)* is thus an isomorphism from X** to (a n)**, that is, from X
to an. We won't check that cp "becomes" e.
By virtue of Corollary 1 of Theorem 6.2, the identity D(t) = D(t*) is the
matrix form of the more general identity b.(T) = b.(T*), and it is interesting to
note the "coordinate free" proof of this equation. Here, of course, T E Hom V.
We first note that the identity (T*A)(O = A(T~) carries through the definitions of @ and 1\ to give
T*Al 1\ ... 1\ T*An(~lI ... , ~n) = Al 1\ ... 1\ An(T~lI ... ,T~n).

(*)

Also, ev~: Al 1\ ... 1\ An;-+ Al 1\ ... 1\ An(~I' ... '~n) is an alternating
n-linear functional on an(v*) for each l; E V n. The left member of (*) is thus
ev~(T*Al' ... , T*An), and, if n = dim V, this is b.(T*)ev~(Al' ... , An) by the
definition of b.. By the same definition the right side of (*) becomes
b.(T)[AI 1\ ... 1\ An(~I' ... , ~n)l = b.(T)ev~(Al' ... , An).
Thus (*) implies the identity b.(T*)ev~ = b.(T)ev~. Since ev~ ~ 0 if l; =
Hi}! is independent, we have proved that b.(T*) = b.(T).
We call a wedge product Al 1\ ... 1\ An of functionals Ai E V* a multivector. We saw above that Al 1\ ... 1\ An ~ 0 if and only if {Ai}1 is independent, in which case {Ai}! spans an n-dimensional subspace of V*. The
following lemma shows that this geometric connection is not accidental.
Lemma 7.3. Two independent n-tuples {Ai}1 and {fJ-i}1 in V* have the
same linear span if and only if fJ-l 1\ ... 1\ fJ-n = k(AI 1\ ... 1\ An) for

some k.

Proof. If {fJ-j}! C L( {Ai}1), then each fJ-j is a linear combination of the A/S, and
if we expand fJ-l 1\ ... 1\ fJ-n according to these basis expansions, we get
k(Al 1\ ... 1\ An). If, furthermore, {fJ-i}1 is independent, then k cannot be zero.

Now suppose, conversely, that Jll /\ ... /\ Jln = kCAl /\ •.. /\ An), where
k ¢ O. This implies first that {Jli} 1 is independent, and then that
Jlj /\ (AI /\ ... /\ An)

for each j, so that each Jlj is dependent on {Ai}1. Together, these two consequences imply that the set {Jlin has the same linear span as {Ain. 0
This lemma shows that a multivector has a relationship to the subspace it
determines like that of a single vector to its span.
8. EXTERIOR POWERS OF SCALAR PRODUCT SPACES

Let V be a finite-dimensional vector space, and let ( , ) be a nondegenerate
(nonsingular) symmetric bilinear form on V. In this and the next section we shall
call any such bilinear form a scalar product, even though it may not be
positive definite. We know that the bilinear form ( , ) induces an isomorphism
of V with V* sending y E V into y E V*, where y(x) = (x, 'fi) = (x, y) for all
x E V. We then get a nondegenerate form (scalar product), which we shall continue to denote by ( , ), on V* by setting (ii, v) = (u, v). We also obtain a
nondegenerate scalar product on aq by setting
(iiI /\ ... /\ iiq , VI /\ ... /\ Vq ) = det (iii, VJ-).

(8.1)

To check that (8.1) makes sense, we first remark that for fixed Vb ... , Vq E V*,
the right-hand side of (8.1) is an antisymmetric multilinear function of the
vectors iiI, ... , iiq, and therefore extends to a linear function on aq(v*) by
Theorem 7.3. Similarly, holding the ii's fixed determines a linear function on
aq(v*), and (8.1) is well defined and extends to a bilinear function on aq(V*).
The right-hand side of (8.1) is clearly symmetric in U and v, so that the bilinear
form we get is indeed symmetric. To see that it is nondegenerate, let us choose a
basis Ul, . . . , Un so that
(8.2)
(We can always find such a basis by Theorem 7.1 of Chapter 2.) We know that
{iii} = {iii! /\ ... /\ iii.} forms a basis for aq, where i = <ib ... ,iq> ranges
over all q-tuplets of integers such that 1 ::::; i l < ... < i q ::::; n, and we claim
that
(8.3)
In fact, if i ¢ j, then ir ¢ js for some value of r between 1 and q and for aIls.
In this case one whole row of the matrix (Ui" Ujm) vanishes, namely, the rth row.
Thus (8.1) gives zero in this case. If i = j, then (8.2) says that the matrix has
±1 down the diagonal and zeros elsewhere, establishing (8.3), and thus the fact
that ( , ) is nondegenerate on aq • In particular, we have

Let V be a finite-dimensional vector space endowed with a nondegenerate scalar
product as in Section 8. The space an is one-dimensional if n is the dimension of
V. The induced scalar product on an is non degenerate, so that (u, u) is either
always positive or always negative for all nonzero u E an. In particular, there
are exactly two u's in an with (u, u) = ±l. Let us choose one of them and hold
it fixed for the remainder of this section. Geometrically, this amounts to choosing
an orientation on V. We thus have picked a

(9.1)

Let ii be some fixed element of a q. Then for any y E a n- q, ii /\ YEan, and so
we can write ii /\ Y = fv(Y)u, where fv(y) depends linearly on y. Since the
induced scalar product ( , ) on a n - q is nondegenerate, there is a unique
element *ii E a n- q such that (y, *ii) = hey). To repeat, we have assigned a
*ii E a n - q to each ii E aq by setting
(y, *ii)u = ii /\

y.

We have thus defined a map, *, from a q to a n - q • It is clear from (9.2) that this
map is linear. Let Ut, •.. , Un be a basis for V satisfying (8.2) and also u =

INTEGRATION

1. INTRODUCTION

In this chapter we shall present a theory of integration in n-dimensional Euclidean space lEn, which the reader will remember is simply Cartesian n-space
IRon together with the standard scalar product. Our main item of business is to
introduce a notion of size for subsets of lEn (area in two dimensions, volume in
three ... ). Before proceeding to the formal definitions, let us see what properties
we would like our notion of size to have. We are looking for a function jJ. which
assigns a number jJ.(A) to bounded subsets A C P.
i)

We would like jJ.(A) to be a nonnegative real number.

ii) If AC B, we would expect to have jJ.(A) ::; jJ.(B).
iii) If A and B are disjoint (that is, A n B =
have jJ.(A U B) = jJ.(A) + jJ.(B).

0), then we would expect to

iv) Let T be any Euclidean motion. * For any set A let T A be the set of all
points of the form Tx, where x E A. We then would expect to have
jJ.(T A) = jJ.(A). (Thus we want "congruent" sets to have the same size.)
v) We would expect a "lower-dimensional set" (where this is suitably defined) to have zero size. Thus points in the line, curves in the plane,
surfaces in three-space, etc., should all have zero size.
vi) By the same token, we would expect open sets to have positive size.
In the above discussion we did not specify what kind of sets we were talking
about. One might be ambitious and try to assign a size to every subset of lEn.
This proves to be impossible, however, for the following reason: Let U and V
be any two bounded open subsets of IE 3. It can be shown t that we can find

* Recall that a Euclidean motion is an isometry of lEn and can thus be represented as
the composition of the translation and an orthogonal transformation.

and

n U; = 0 = Vi n V; for i ¢ j, and Euclidean motions Ti with
TiU i = Vi. In other words, we can break up U into finitely many pieces, move

with U,

these pieces around, and then recombine them to get V. Needless to say, the
sets U i will have to look very bad. A moment's reflection shows that if we wish
to assign a size to all subsets (including those like U i ), we cannot satisfy (ii) ,
(iii), (iv), and (vi). In fact, (iii) [repeated (k - I) times] implies that
k

p,(U) =

:E p,(Ui ),
i=1

and (iv) implies that p,(Ui ) = p,(Vi ). Thus p,(U) = p,(V), or the size of any two
open sets would coincide. Since any open set contains two disjoint open sets,
this implies, by (ii), that p,(U) ? 2p,(U), so p,(U) = O.
Weare thus faced with a choice. Either we dispense with some of requirements (i) through (vi) above, or we do not assign a size to every subset of lEn.
Since our requirements are reasonable, we prefer the second alternative. This
means, of course, that now, in addition to introducing a notion of size, we must
describe the class of "good" sets we wish to admit.
We shall proceed axiomatically, listing some "reasonable" axioms for a class
of subsets and a function p,.
2. AXIOMS

Our axioms will concern a class :D of subsets of lEn and a function p, defined on :D.
(That is, p,(A) is defined if A is a subset of lEn belonging to our collection :D.)
I. :D is a collection of subsets of P such that:

Before proceeding, some remarks about our axioms are in order. Axiom:D1
will allow us to perform elementary set-theoretical operations with the elements
of :D. Note that in Axioms :D2 and p,3 we are only allowing translations, but in

llIuclidean motions in (iv). The reason for this is that we shall show that for
B~good" choices of :0, the axioms, as they stand, uniquely determine J.I.. It will
'lhen turn out that J.I. actually satisfies the stronger condition (iv) , while we
Issume the weaker condition J.l.3 as an axiom.

Axiom :03 guarantees that our theory is not completely trivial, i.e., the
t}bllection :0 is not empty. Axiom J.l.4 has the effect of normalizing J.I.. Without it,
tf¥ly J.I. satisfying J.l.l, J.l.2, and J.l.3 could be multiplied by any nonnegative real
"1;tumber, and the new function J.I.' so obtained would still satisfy our axioms.
flh particular, J.l.4 guarantees that we do not choose J.I. to be the trivial function
:lSSigp.ing to each A the value zero.

Fig. 8.2

Our program for the next few sections is to make some reasonable choices for
.:0 and to show that for the given:o there exists a unique J.I. satisfying J.l.l through J.l.4.
An important elementary consequence of the :0, J.I.-axioms that we shall fre-

quently use without comment is:
p.5. If A

c U1 Ai and all the sets are in :0, then J.I.(A)

l:1 J.I.(Ai).

Our beginning work will be largely combinational. We will first consider
(generalized) rectangles, which are just Cartesian products of intervals, and the
iway in which a point inside a rectangle determines a splitting of the rectangle
,.into a collection of smaller rectangles, as indicated in Fig. 8.1. This is associated
with the fact that the intersection of any two rectangles is a rectangle and the
difference of two rectangles is a finite disjoint union df rectangles (see Fig. 8.2).

Fig. 8.3

We call a set A paved if it can be expressed as the union of a finite disjoint
collection p of rectangles (a paving of A). It will follow from our combinational
considerations that the collection !Dmin of all the paved sets satisfies Axioms !Dl
through !D3 and is the smallest family that does: any other collection !D satisfying
the axioms includes !Dmin. It will then follow that if M satisfies Ml through M4 on
!Dmin, then it must have the natural value (the product of the lengths of the sides)
for a rectangle. This implies that M is uniquely defined on !Dmin by requirements
Ml through M4, since the value M(A) for any paved set A must be the sum of the
natural values for the rectangles in a paving of A. The existence of M on !Dmin
thus depends on the crucial lemma that two different pavings of the set A give
the same sum. (See Fig. 8.3.)
This comes down to the fact that the "intersection" of two pavings of A is
a third paving "finer" than either, and the fact that when a single rectangle is
broken up, the natural values of M for the pieces add up to M for the fragmented
rectangle.
All these considerations are elementary but exceedingly messy in detail. We
give the proofs below for the reader to refer to in case of doubt, but he may
prefer to study only the definitions and statements of results and then to proceed
to Section 6.
3. RECTANGLES AND PAVED SETS

We first introduce some notation and terminology. Let a = -< a \ ... , an >and b = -<bI, ... , bn >- be elements of lEn. By the rectangle D~ we shall mean
the set of all x = -< xI, ... , x n >- in lEn with a i ~ Xi < bi • Thus

(3.2)

In the plane (n = 2) for instance, our rectangles D~ correspond to ordinary
Euclidean rectangles whose sides are parallel to the axes. (We should perhaps use
an additional adjective and call our sets level rectangles, braced rectangles, or
something else, but for simplicity we shall just call them rectangles.) Note that
in the plane our rectangles include the left-hand and lower edges but not the
right-hand and upper ones (see Fig. 8.4).

For general n, if we set 1 = -< 1, ... , 1» , then our notation coincides with
that of ::03.
We now collect some elementary facts about rectangles. It follows immediatelyfrom the definition (3.1) that if a = -<at, ... , ak », b = -<bt, . .. , bn »,
etc., then
(3.3)
O~nO~ = O!,

and
~ = 1, ... , n.
(The reader should draw various different instances of this equation in the plane
to get the correct geometrical feeling.) Note that the case where O~ n O~ = >Z5
is included in (3.3) by (3.2). Another immediate consequence of the definition
(3.1) is
for any translation T.
(3.4)
We will now establish some elementary results which will imply that any ::0
satisfying Axioms ::01 through ::03 must contain all rectangles.
Lemma 3.1. Any rectangle O~ can be written as the disjoint union
where

br

a r E D~.

(What this says is that any "big" rectangle can be written as a finite union
of "small" ones.)
Proof. We may assume that O~ ~ >Z5 (otherwise take k = 0 in the union).
Thus bi > a i . In particular, if we choose the integer m sufficiently large,
(1/2m)(b - a) will lie in O~.
By induction, it therefore suffices to prove that we can decompose O~ into
the disjoint union

(3.5)

(For then we can continue to subdivide until the rectangles we get are small
enough.)
We get this subdivision in the obvious way by choosing the vertex "in the
middle" of the rectangle and considering all rectangles obtained by cutting
D~ through this point by coordinate hyperplanes. To write down an explicit

indexing set, rather than the integers 1, ... ,2n. Let J denote an arbitrary subset of {1,2, ... ,n}. LetaJ= <a}, ... ,aj> andb J = <b}, ... ,bj> be

Since b J - aJ = -!(b - a) for all J, we have proved the lemma. 0
We now observe that for any c E D~ we have, by (3.3),

Do = D~ n D~-l'

(3.6)

Let Tv denote translation through the vector v. Then D~-l = Tc - l D~ by
(3.4). Thus by Axioms i>2 and i>3 the rectangle D~-l must belong to i>.
By (3.6) and Axiom i>1 we conclude that Do E i> for any c E D~.
Observe that TaD~-a = D~ by (3.4). Thus

If we now apply Lemma 3.1 we conclude that

(3.7)

We make the following definition.
Definition 3.1. A subset S C lEn will be called a paved set if S is the disjoint

union of finitely many rectangles.
We can then assert:
Proposition 3.1. Any i> satisfying Axioms i>1 through i>3 must contain all
paved sets. Let i>min denote the collection of all finite unions of rectangles;
then i>min satisfies Axioms i>1 through i>3.

Proof. We have already proved the first part of this proposition. We leave the

second part as an exercise for the reader.

4. THE MINIMAL THEORY

Weare now going to see how far M is determined by Axioms M1 through M3.
In fact, we are going to show the M(D~) is what it should be; i.e., if

M(D~) = {~bl - al) ... (b n -

(4.1)

AxiomM4 says that (4.1) holds for the special case a = 0, b = 1. Examining
the proof of Lemma 3.1 shows that D~ can be written as the disjoint union of 2n
rectangles, all congruent (via translation) to D~12, where i = (!, ... , !).
Axioms M2 and M3 then imply that

M(D~12) =

21n'

Repeating this argument inductively shows that
M( D 0

= 2M

We shall now use (4.2) to verify (4.1). The idea is
to approximate any rectangle by unions of translates of cubes

D oll2r .

Observe that in proving (4.1) we need to consider only rectangles of the form
D~. In fact, we take c = b - a and observe that
T -a (D~)

so Axiom M3 implies that M(D~) = M(D~), and by definition e 1 ••• en =
(b 1 - a 1 ) ••• (b n - an). If D~ = 0, then (4.1) is trivially true (from Axiom

We first introduce some notation.
Definition 5.1. A paving p of lEn is a finite collection of mutually disjoint

rectangles. The floor of this paving, denoted by [pI, is the union of all
rectangles belonging to p.
If p = {D~:} and T is a translation, we set Tp = {TD~:}.
If p and g are two pavings, we say that g is finer than p (and write g -< p)
if every rectangle of p is a union of rectangles of g. It is clear that if p -< 9:/
and g -< p, then g -< 9:/. Note also that g -< P implies [p[ C [gr.
Proposition 5.1. Let p and g be any two pavings.

There exists a third

g.

Proof. The idea of the proof is very simple. Each rectangle in p or in g determines 2 n hyperplanes (each hyperplane containing a face of the rectangle).
If we collect all these hyperplanes, they will "enclose" a number of rectangles.
We let 9:/ consist of those rectangles in this collection which do not contain any
smaller rectangle. Figure 8.7 shows the case (for n = 2) where p and g each
contain one rectangle. Here 9:/ contains nine rectangles.
We now fill in the details of this argument. Let Cl = -< cL ... , c~ >- , ... ,
Ck =
-< ck, ... , Ck>- be all the vectors that occur in the description of the
rectangles of p and g. (In other words, if D~ E: P or E: g, then a and b are among
the c's.) Let d 1 , . . • , dk n be the vectors of the form -<
cin >-, where the i/s
range independently from 1 to k, (so that there are kn of them). (See Fig. 8.8 for
the case where n = 2 and p and g consist of one rectangle each.) For each d i
there is at most one smallest dj(i) such that d i < dj(i)' In fact, if

CONTENTED SETS

Summing over all D~: (and doing the same for D~l) proves (5.2). We can thus
state:
TheoreD1 5.1. Every A E :Dmin can be written as A = Ipl. The number
JL(A) = LOEPJL(O) does not depend on the choice of p. We thus get a
well-defined function JL on :Dmin. It satisfies Axioms JL1 through JL4. If JL' is
any other function on :Dmin satisfying JL2 and JL3, then JL'(A) = KJL(A),
where K = JL'(O~).

Proof. The proof of the last two assertions of the theorem is easy and is left as an
exercise for the reader.
6. CONTENTED SETS

Theorem 5.1 shows that our axioms are not vacuous. It does not provide us
with a satisfactory theory, however, because :Dmin contains far too few sets.
In particular, it does not fulfill requirement (iii), since :Dmin is not invariant
under rotations, except under very special ones. We are now going to remedy
this by repeating the arguments of Section 4; we are going to try to approximate
more general sets by sets whose JL'S we know, i.e., by sets contained in :Dmin.
This idea goes back to Archimedes, who used it to find the areas of figures in
the plane.
Definition 6.1. Let A be any subset of lEn. We say that P is an inner paving

of A if

Ipi CA.

We say that S is an outer paving of A if A

We list several obvious facts.

and an outer paving S such that J-t(S) - J-t(p) < 0/2. We want to replace p by
a close paving p' with Ip'l c int A. To do this, we choose a small number 1/
and replace each rectangle D~ of p by D~+~~~=:~. We let p~ be the collection
of all these rectangles. Then Ip~1 C int Ipl, so Ip~1 C int A. Furthermore,
J-t(lp~l) = (1 - 21/)nJ-t(lpl), since the factor (1 - 21/) is the decrease of each side
of each rectangle of p. Similarly, we replace S by a slightly larger s~, with
A C int S~ and J-t(S~) :::; (1 + 21/)nJ-t(S). By choosing 1/ sufficiently small, we
can thus arrange that J-t(S~) - J-t(p~) < o. Let v be a paving which is finer
than S~ and p~, with Ivl = Is~l. Let.4- C v consist of those rectangles of 'V
lying in int A. Then Ivl = Is~1 =:> 1.4-1 =:> Ip~l, so J-t(lvl) - J-t(I.4-I) :::; o. But,
aA c Iv - .4-1, so that ,il(aA) :::; J-t(lv - .4-1) = J-t(lvl) - J-t(I.4-1) < o. In other
words, ,il(aA) = o.
Conversely, suppose that aA has content zero. Let.4- be an outer paving of
aA with J-t(I.4-1) < E. Let v be a paving finer than .4- and such that A C Ivl.
Let p C v consist of those rectangles contained in A. Let S C v consist of those
rectangles lying in Ipi U 1.4-1. ThenJ-t(lsl) :::; J-t(lpl) +J-t(I.4-1) < J-tCipl) + E. Furthermore, A C lsi. In fact, let x E A. Then xED for some 0 E v. If 0 n aA ~
0, then 0 n 1.4-1 ~ 0, so 0 c 1.4-1, since v is a refinement of.4-. If 0 n aA = 0,
then every point of 0 must lie in A, so that 0 C Ipl. We have thus constructed
p and S with Ipi cAe lsi and J-t(S) - J-t(p) < E. Since we can do this for any f,
this implies that A is contented. D

arbitrarily close approximations to A (relative to p,), we are done. 0

If we combine (7.2) and (7.3), we see that any cube G lies in a ball B such
that fl(B) S 2n(Vn)np.(G) and that any ball B lies in a cube G such that p.(G) <
3n(yn)nfl(B).

Let A be a subset of lEn. Then A has content zero if and only
if for every E > 0 there exist a finite number of balls {Bi} covering A
with L fl(Bi) < E.
Lelllllla 7.1.

Proof. If we have such a collection of covering balls, then by the above remark
we can enlarge each ball to a rectangle to get a paving p such that A C Ipi and
p.(lpl) < 3n(yn)nE. Therefore, fleA) = 0 if we can always find the {B i }.
Conversely, suppose A has content O. Then for any 0 we can find an outer
paving p with p.(lpl) < o. For each rectangle 0 in the paving we can, by thp
arguments of Section 4, find a finite number of cubes which cover 0 and whose
total content is as close as we like to p.(O), say <2p.(O). By doing this for each
E p, we have a finite number of cubes {Oi} covering A with total content
less than 20. Then by our remark before the lemma each cube O. lies in a ball
Bi such that P.(Oi) < 2n(Vn)nfl (B.), and so we have a covering of A by balls Bi
such that L fl(Bi) < 2n+ 1 (yn)n o. If we take 0 = E/2n+ 1 (yn)n, we have the
desired collection of balls, proving the lemma. 0

Proposition 7.1. Let A be a set of content zero with

Proof. The proof consists of applying both parts of Lemma 7.1. Since A has

content zero, for any E > 0 we can find a finite number of balls covering A whose
total outer content is less than E/Kn. By (7.4), cp(B~) C B:[,.), so that the images
of the balls covering A cover cp(A) and have a total volume less than E. 0
Recall that if cp is a (continuously) differentiable map of an open set U into
lEn, then cp satisfies a Lipschitz condition on any compact subset of U.
As a consequence of Proposition 7.1, we can thus state:
Proposition 7.2. Let cp be a continuously differentiable map defined on an

open set U, and ld A be a bounded set of content zero with
cp(A) has content zero.

Let A be any compact subset of P lying entirely in the subspace given by

Now let 1/;: V C p-l ~ P be a continuously differentiable map given by
<yl, ... , yn-l> ~ <I/;l(yl, ... , yn-l), ... , I/;n(yI, ... , yn-l».
Let B be any bounded subset of p-l with ]'j C V. We can then write I/;(B) =
~(A), where A is the set of points in lEn of the form (y, 0), where y E B, and
where ~ is a differentiable map such that
~(Xl, ... ,

xn) = <I/;I(xI, ... , x n - l ), ... , I/;n(xI, ... , x n- l ».

By Proposition 7.2 we see that p.CI/;(B)

Proposition 7.3. Let I/; be a differentiable map of V C IE n - 1 into lEn, and
let B be a bounded set such that ]'j c V. Then I/;(B) has content zero.

We have thus recovered requirement (v) of Section l.
An immediate consequence of Propositions 7.3 and 6.1 is:
Proposition 7.4. Let A C P be such that aA c UI/;i(B i ) where each I/;i and

Bi is as in Proposition 7.3. Then A is contented.
This shows that every set "we can draw" is contented.
Exercise. Show that every ball is contented.
8. BEHAVIOR UNDER LINEAR DISTORTIONS

We shall continue to derive consequences of Proposition 7.l.
Proposition 8.1. Let ~ be a one-to-one map of U ~ P which satisfies a
Lipschitz condition and is such that ~-l is continuous. If A c U is contented, then so is ~(A).

Proof. Since A is contented, aA has content zero. By the conditions on ~,
we know that a~(A) = ~(aA). Thus a~(A) has content zero, and so ~(A) is
contented. 0
An immediate consequence of Proposition 8.1 is:
Proposition 8.2. Let L be a linear transformation of P. Then LA is con-

tented whenever A is contented.
Proof. If Lis nonsingular, Proposition 8.1 applies. If L is singular, it maps all
of lEn onto a proper subspace. Any such subspace is contained in the image of
{x : xn = O} by a suitable linear transformation, and so p.(LA) = 0 for any
contented A. 0
Theorem 8.1. Let L be a linear transformation of P. Then for any contented A we have
(8.1)
p.(LA) = Idet LIp.(A).

Proof. We can restrict our attention to nonsingular L, since we have already
checked Eq. (8.1) for det L = o. If L is nonsingular, then L carries the class of

contented sets into itself. Let us define fJ.' by fJ.'(A) = fJ.(LA) for each A E :Deon .
We claim that fJ.' satisfies Axioms fJ.1 through fJ.3 on :Deon .
In fact, fJ.1 and fJ.2 are obviously true; fJ.3 follows from the fact that for any
translation Tv, we have T LvL = LTv, so that
fJ.'(TvA)

=

fJ.(LTvA)

=

fJ.(TLvLA)

=

fJ.(LA) = fJ.'(A).

By Theorem 5.2 we thus conclude that
fJ.'

= kLfJ.,

where kL is some constant depending on L. We must show that kL = Idet LI.
We first observe that if 0 is an orthogonal transformation, then
fJ.(OA) = fJ.(A).

In fact, we know that fJ.(OA) = kOfJ.(A). If we take A to be the unit ball B~,
then OB~ = B~, so ko = l.
Next we observe that fJ.(L I L 2 A) = k L1 fJ.(L 2 A) = k L JCL 2 fJ.(A), so that

Now we recall that any nonsingular L can be written as L = PO, where P
is a positive self-adjoint operator and 0 is orthogonal. Thus kL = k p and
Idet LI = Idet PI Idet 01 = Idet PI, so we need only verify (S.l) for positive selfadjoint linear transformations. Any such P can be written as P = OID01 \
whe~e 0 1 is orthogonal and D is diagonal. Since P is positive, all the eigenvalues
of D are positive. Since det P = det D and k p = kD, we need only verify (S.U

9. AXIOMS FOR INTEGRATION

SO far we have shown that there is a unique fJ. defined for a large collection of
sets in lEn. However, we do not have an effective way to compute fJ., except in
very special cases. To remedy this we must introduce a theory of integration.
We first introduce some notation.
Definition 9.1. Let f be any real-valued function on lEn. By the support of
j, denoted by supp j, we shall mean the closure of the set where j is not zero;
that is,
suppj = {x: j(x) rf O}.

and

(9.2)

We shall say that f has compact support if supp f is compact. Equation (9.1)
[and Eq. (9.2) applied to constant gj shows that the set of all functions with
compact support form a vector space.
Let T be any one-to-one transformation of lEn onto itself. For any function f
we denote by Tf the functions given by

(Tf)(x)

=

f(T-1x).

(9.3)

Observe that if T and T- 1 are continuous, then
supp Tf

=

T supp f.

(9.4)

Definition 9.2. Let A be a subset of lEn. By the characteristic function of A,
denoted by eA, we shall mean the function given by

if x E A,
if xtiA.

(9.5)

Note that

eA l nA 2 = eAl . eA 2 ,
eA l UA 2 = eAl + eA 2 - eA l nA 2 ,
supp eA = X,

(9.9)

By a theory of integration on P we shall mean a collection 5' of functions
and a rule I which assigns a real number If to each f E 5', subject to the following axioms:
5'1. 5' is a vector subspace of the space of all bounded functions of compact

support.
5'2. If f E 5' and T is a translation, then Tf E 5'.

I5. IIfl :::; IIflloo,u(suppf) for every f Ea:.
Proof. The axioms guarantee that eA E a: for every A E !Dmin and that v(A) =
I eA satisfies ,u1 through ,u4. Therefore, I eA = ,u(A) for every A E !Dmin by the
uniqueness of ,u (Proposition 4.1). It follows that if A is a contented set such
that eA E a:, and if p and s are inner and outer pavings of A, then
,u(lpi)

=

Je 1,,1 :::; JeA :::; Je lsi = ,u(jsi).

Therefore, I eA lies between ,u*(A) and ,a(A), and so equals ,u(A). For any
f E a: and any A E !Dmin such that supp f ~ A, we have -llfll",eA :::; f :::;
IIfll",eA, and therefore IIfl :::; IIfll",,u(A) by I3' and (9.10). Taking the greatest
lower bound of the right side over all such sets A, we have I5. 0
10. INTEGRATION OF CONTENTED FUNCTIONS

We will now proceed to deal with Axioms a: and I in the same way we dealt
with Axioms !D and,u. We will construct a "minimal" theory and then get a "big"
one by approximating. According to Proposition 9.1, the class a: must contain
the function e 1,,1 for any paving p. By a:1 it must therefore contain all linear
combinations of such.
Definition 10.1. By a paved function we shall mean a function f = f"

given by
(10.1)
for some paving p.
It is easy to see that the collection of all paved functions satisfies Axioms n
through 53. Furthermore, by Proposition 9.1 and Axiom II the integral, I, is
uniquely determined on the class of all paved functions by

(10.2)
if f is given by (10.1).
The reader should verify that if we let a:p be the class of all paved functions
and let I be given by (10.2), then all our axioms are satisfied. Don't forget to
show that I is well defined: if f is expressed as in (10.1) in two ways, then the
sums given by (10.2) are equal.

INTEGRATION OF CONTENTED FUNCTIONS

The paved functions obviously form too small a collection of functions.
We would like to have an 5' including all continuous functions with compact
support and all characteristic functions of the form eA with A contented, for
example.
Definition 10.2. A bounded function f with compact support is said to be
contented if for any e > 0 and a > 0 there exists a paved function g = g.,a
and a contented set A = A.,a such that

If(x) - g(x) I

Let us verify that the collection of all contented functions, 5'con, satisfies
Axioms 5'1 through n. It is clear that iffis contented, so is affor any constant a.
If fl and f2 are contented, let -<gb Al >- and -<Y2, A 2 >- be paved e,a-approximations to fl and f2' respectively. Then

Thus -<gl
g2, Al U A 2 >- gives a paved 2e, 2 a-approximation tofI

To verify 5'2 we simply observe that if -< g, A>- is a paved e, a-approximation
to f, then -< Tg, T A >- is one to Tf.
A similar argument establishes the analogous result for multiplication:
Proposition 10.1. Let fI and f2 be two contented functions.

Then fd2 is

contented.

Proof. Let M be such that Ifl(X) < M and If2(X)1 < M for all x. Recall that
the product of two paved functions is a paved function. Using the same notation
as before, we have
Ifl12(X) - gl(X)g2(X)1 :::; IfI(x)llf2(X) - g2(x)1

As for 5'3, it is immediate that a stronger statement is true:
Proposition 10.2. If B is a contented set, then eB is a contented function.

Proposition 10.3. A function f is contented if and only if for every E there

Proof. Iff is contented, let R be a rectangle including supp f. Let -< g, A>- be an

functions.
Proposition 10.4. Let f be a bounded function with compact support.

Then let f •. 2a(x) = f(Xi) when x E Di, where Xi is some point of Di. By (ii)

contented.
Conversely, suppose that f is contented,
and letf./2.a/2, A./ 2 •a/ 2 be a paved approximation to f.
Let p = {Di} be the paving associated
with f./2.aj2. Replace each Di by the rectangle D~ obtained by contracting Di about
its center by a factor (1 - ~). (See Fig. 8.10.)
Thus ,u(DD = (1 - ~)n,u(Di). For any x,

11. THE CHANGE OF VARIABLES FORMULA

This section will be devoted to the proof of the following theorem, which is of
fundamental importance.
Theorem 11.1. Let U and V be bounded open sets in IRn, and let !p be a
continuously differentiable one-to-one map of U onto V with !p - 1 differentiable
Let f be a contented function with supp f C V. Then (f !p) is a contented function,
and

(11.1 )

Recall that if the map cp is given by yi = cpi(Xl, ... , xn), then J I" is th(~
linear transformation whose matrix is [acpi/aXj).
Note that if cp is a nonsingular linear transformation (so that JI" is just cp),
then Theorem 11.1 is an easy consequence of Theorem 8.1. In fact, for functions
of the form CA we observe that CA 0 cp = CI"-lA, and Eq. (11.1) reduces, in this
case, to (8.1). By linearity, (11.1) is valid for all paved functions.
Furthermore,fo cp is contented. Suppose If(x) - f(y) I < Ewhen IIx - yll <
cp and x, y tl A, with ,u(A) < o. Then If 0 cp(u) - f 0 cp(v) I < E when
and

u, v tl cp-l(A),

with ,u(cp-l A) < o/Idet cpl.
Now let g•. ~, A •. ~ be an approximating family of paved functions for f. Theil
Ifo cp(x) - g•. ~ 0 cp(x) I < eforx tl cp-l(A •. ~) and,u(cp-lA •. ~) < o/Idet cpl. Thus
I(g •. ~ 0 cp)ldet cpl - t I(fo cp)ldet cpl, and Eq. (11.1) is valid for all contentedf.
The proof of Theorem 11.1 for nonlinear maps is a bit more tricky. It consists essentially of approximating cp locally by linear maps, and we shall do it ill
several steps. We shall use the uniform norm IIxli ao = max IXil on ~n. This is
convenient because a ball in this norm is actually a cube, although this nicety
isn't really necessary.

In practice, we sometimes may apply Eq. (11.1) to a situation where the
hypotheses of Theorem 11.1 are not, strictly speaking, verified. For instance, in
1R2 we may want to introduce "polar coordinates". That is, we let r, be coordinates on 1R2; if S is the set 0 ::; < 21r,0 ::; r, we consider the map cp: S ~ 1R2
given by x = r cos 0, y = r sin 0, where x, yare coordinates on a second copy
of \R 2 • Now this map is one-to-one and has positive Jacobian for r > O. If we
consider the open sets U C S given by 0 < r, 0 <
21r and V C \R 2 given by

V = \R - {x, y : y = 0, x ~ O}, the hypotheses of Theorem 11.1 are fulfilled,

Theorem 11.1. In each case the limit argument is usually quite straightforward

INTEGRATION

12. SUCCESSIVE INTEGRATION

In the case of one variable, i.e., the theory of integration on IRI, the fundamental
theorem of the calculus reduces the computation of the integral of a function to
the computation of its antiderivative. The generalization of this theorem to
n dimensions will be presented in a later chapter. In this section we will show
how, in many cases, the computation of an n-dimensional integral can be reduced
to n successive one-dimensional integrations.
Suppose we regard IR n , in some fixed way, as the direct product IRn =
IRk X 1R1. We shall write everyz E IRn as z = -<x, y>, where x E IRk and y E IR/.
Definition: 12.1. We say that a contented function f is contented relative to
the decomposition IRn = IRk X IRI if there exists a set AI C IRk of content

zero (in IRk) such that

A" the function f(x, .) is a contented function

ii) the function IRlf which assigns to x the number IRlf(x, .) is a contented
function on IRk.
It is easy to see that the set of all such functions satisfies Axioms 5'1 through
5'3. (The only axiom that is not immediate is 5'2. But this is an easy consequence
of the fact that any translation T can be rewritten as TIT2 ,where Tl is a translation in IRk and T2 is a translation in 1R1.)
It is equally easy to verify that the rule which assigns to any such f the

Note, in particular, that if f is also contented relative to the decomposition
IRn = IRI X IRk, then

In particular, for such f the double integration is independent of the order.

13. ABSOLUTELY INTEGRABLE FUNCTIONS

Thus far we have been dealing with bounded functions of compact support. In
practice, we would like to be able to integrate functions which neither are
bounded nor have compact support. Let f be a function defined on lEn, let M be
a nonnegative real number, and let A be a (bounded) contented subset of lEn.
Let If be the function
if x El A,
if x E A and If(x) I > M,
If(x) =
f(x)
if x E A and If(x) I ~ M.

{~

Thus If is a bounded function of compact support. It is obtained from f by
cutting f back to zero outside A and cutting f back to M when If(x) I > M.
We say that a function f is absolutely integrable if
i) If is a contented function for all M > 0 and contented sets A; and
ii) for any E > 0 there is a bounded contented set A. such that eA • • f is
bounded and for all M > 0 and all B with B n A. = >0,

<

JlfWI

E.

It is easy to check that the sum of two absolutely integrable functions is again
absolutely integrable. Thus the set of absolutely integrable functions forms a
vector space. Note that if f satisfies condition (i) and If(x) I < Ig(x)1 for all x,
where g is absolutely integrable, then f is absolutely integrable.
Let f be an absolutely integrable function. Given any E, choose a corresponding A.. Then for any numbers M I and M 2 ~ maXxEA. If(x) I and for any sets
Al ~ A. and A2 ~ A.,

If we let E ~ 0 and choose a corresponding family of A., then the above inequality implies that the lim ffA. is independent of the choice of the A •. We define
this limit to be ff.
We now list some very crude sufficient criteria for a function to be absolutely
integrable. We will consider the two different causes of trouble-nonboundedness and lack of compact support.
Let f be a bounded function with fA contented for any contented set A.
Suppose If(x) I ::; Cllxll-k for large values of Ilxll. Let Br be the ball of radius r
centered at the origin. If TI is large enough so that the inequality holds for

Let f be a bounded function such that fA is contented for any contented
set A. Suppose that If(x)1 ---+ 0 as Ilxll ---+ 00 in such a way that Ilxllklf(x)1 is
bounded for some k > n. Then f is absolutely integrable.
N ow let us examine the situation when f is of compact support but unbounded. Suppose first that there is a point Xo such that f is bounded in the
complement of any neighborhood of Xo. Suppose, furthermore, that
If(x)1 ~ Ckllx - xoll- k
for some constants C and k. Then if If(x) I > 111, Ilx - xoll- k > M/C or
IIx - xoll < C/MI/k.
Let B1 be the ball of radius CM 1I / k centered at Xo. Then If(x)1 > M1
implies that x E B 1. Furthermore, for M 2 > M 1 we have

which can be made arbitrarily small by choosing M 1 large.
Thus if f has compact support and is such that fM is contented for all M and
If(x) I < Cllx - xoll- k with k < n, thenfis absolutely integrable.
More generally, let S be a bounded subset of an l-dimensional subspace of
lEn. Let d(x) denote the distance from x to S. Let f be a function of compact
support with fM contented for all M. If If(x) I < C d(x)-k with k < n - l,
then f is absolutely integrable. The proof is similar to that given above and is left
to the reader.
Let Uk} be a sequence of absolutely integrable functions. Under what
conditions will the sequence f f n ---+ f f if the sequence A(x) ---+ f(x)? Even if the
sequence converges uniformly, there is no guarantee that the integrals converge.
For instance, if fk = (l/kn)eD~, then Ifk(X)1 ~ l/k n, so that fk approaches zero
uniformly. On the other hand, ffk = 1 for all k.

We say that a set of functions Uk} is uniformly absolutely integrable if for
any E > 0 there is an A. which can be chosen independently of k such that
for all M
wherever B n A. = 0.
We frequently verify that {ik} is uniformly absolutely integrable by showing
that there is an absolutely integrable function g such that Ifk(X)1 ~ Ig(x)1 for
all k and x.
Let Uk} be a uniformly absolutely integrable sequence of functions. Suppose
that fk ~ f uniformly. Suppose in addition that f is absolutely integrable. Then
Ifk ~ If. In fact, for any 0 > 0 we can find a ko such that Ifk(X) - f(x) I < 0
for all k > ko and all x. We can also find A. and M. such that

which can be made arbitrarily small by first choosing E small (which then gives
an A.) and then choosing 0 small (which means choosing ko large).
The main applications that we shall make of the preceding ideas will be to
the problems of computing iterated integrals and of differentiating under the

Proposition 13.1. Let f be a function on ~k X ~l. Suppose that the set of

Proof. To show that (f 0 tp)ldet J <pI is absolutely integrable, let E > 0 and
choose an A. C V such that (ii) holds. Then A. is compact, and therefore so is
tp-l(A.). In particular, tp-l(A.) is a bounded contented set and Idet J <pI is

of f as well.
If f is a Coo-function of compact support, then (14.1) obviously holds, so
f E s. A more instructive example is provided by the function n given by
n(x) = e-lIxIl2 •

Since limT--->oo r P e- r2 = 0 for any p, it follows that limllxll--->oo a(x)n(x) = o. On
the other hand, it is easy to see (by induction) that Dan(x) = Pa(x)n(x) for

We thus see that IIfliR measures the size of f and its derivatives to order R in
the square integral norm. It is helpful to think of II II. as a generalization of this notion
of size, where now s can be an arbitrary real number.

We now define the space H8 to be the completion of S under the norm II II.. The

H t -2 •. We shall also denote this extended map by K8. By Exercise 14.21,

CHAPTER 9

DIFFERENTIABLE MANIFOLDS

Thus far our study of the calculus has been devoted to the study of properties
of and operations on functions defined on (subsets of) a vector space. One of
the ideas used was the approximation of possibly nonlinear functions at each
point by linear functions. In this chapter we shall generalize our notion of space
to include spaces which cannot, in any natural way, be regarded as open subsets
of a vector space. One of the tools we shall use is the "approximation" of such a
space at each point by a linear space.
Suppose we are interested in studying functions on (the surface of) the unit
sphere in 1E3. The sphere is a two-dimensional object in the sense that we can
describe a neighborhood of every point of the sphere in a bicontinuous way by
two coordinates. On the other hand, we cannot map the sphere in a bicontinuous
one-to-one way onto an open subset of the plane (since the sphere is compact and
an open subset of 1E2 is not). Thus pieces of the sphere can be described by open
subsets of 1E2, but the whole sphere cannot. Therefore, if we want to do calculus
on the whole sphere at once, we must introduce a more general class of spaces
and study functions on them.
Even if a space can be regarded as a subset of a vector space, it is conceivable
that it cannot be so regarded in any canonical way. Thus the state of a (homogeneous ideal) gas in equilibrium is specified when one gives any two of the three
parameters: temperature, pressure, or volume. There is no reason to prefer any
two to the third. The transition from one set of parameters to the other is given
by a one-to-one bidifferentiable map. Thus any function of the states of the
gas which is a differentiable function in terms of one choice of parameters is
differentiable in terms of any other. Thus it makes sense to talk of differentiable
functions on the states of the gas. However, a function which is linear in terms
of one choice of parameters need not be linear in terms of the other. Thus it
doesn't really make sense to talk of linear functions on the states of the gas.
In such a situation we would like to know what properties of functions and what
operations make sense in the space and are not artifacts of the description we
give of the space.
Finally, even in a vector space it is sometimes convenient to introduce
"nonlinear coordinates" for the solution of specific problems: for example, polar
coordinates in Exercises 11.3 and 11.4, Chapter 8. We would therefore like to
know how various objects change when we change coordinates and, if possible,
to introduce notation which is independent of the coordinate system.

DIFFERENTIABLE MANIFOLDS

We will begin our formal discussion with the definition of differentiable
manifolds. The basic idea is ~imilar to the one that is used in everyday life to
describe the surface of the earth. One gives a collection of charts describing small
overlapping portions of the globe. We can piece the whole picture together by
seeing how the charts match up.

Note that the atlas we gave for the sphere contains only two charts (each
given by polar projection). An atlas of the earth usually contains many more
charts. In other words, many different atlases can be used to describe the same

Fig. 9.3

The circle. The circle 8 1 is a "one-dimensional sphere" and therefore
has an atlas as described in Example 2. We wish to describe a different atlas
on 8 1 . Regard 8 1 as the unit circle x~ + x~ = 1, and consider the function 8b
defined in a neighborhood of < 1, 0> on the upper semicircle of 8 1, which gives
the angle from the point on 8 1 to < 1, 0> (see Fig. 9.3). As we move counterclockwise around the circle, this function is well defined until we hit < 1, >
again. We will take, as the first chart in our atlas, (U 1 , 81), where U 1 =
8 1 - {< 1,0>} and 81 is the function defined above. Let U 2 = 8 1 - {<o, I>},
and define 82 to be 7r /2 plus the angle (measured counterclockwise) from
<0,1> (see Fig. 9.4).
Now U 1 n U 2 = 8 1 - {<1,0>, <0, I>}, and
8 1 (U 1 n U 2 ) = (0,27r) - {7r/2}.

Banach spaces. Then the collection e = {( U i X V j, 'Pi X 1/1 j)} is a (V 1 X V 2)atlas on M X N. Here 'Pi X 1/Ij(p, q) = < 'Pi(P) , 1/Ii(q) > if <p, q> E Ui X Wj.

It is an instructive exercise to write down the atlases and transition functions
explicitly in these cases.
ExaDlple 5. As a generalization of our first example, let S be a submanifold of
an (n m)-dimensional vector space X, as defined in Section 12 of Chapter 3.
For each neighborhood N defined there, the set S n N, together with the map l{J
which is defined as the projection 1r1 restricted to S, provides a chart with
values in V (where X is viewed as V X W). In such a neighborhood N the set S
is presented as a graph of function F. In other words,

+

SnN= {-<x,F(x)~ EVX W:XE1r1(S)},

where F is a smooth map of A = 1r1(S n N) into W. Let N' be another such
neighborhood with corresponding projection 1r~ (where now X is identified with
V X W in some other way). Then l{J' 0 l{J-1(X) = 1r~(x, F(x»), which shows
that l{J' 0 l{J-1 is a smooth map. Thus every submanifold in the sense of Chapter 3
possesses an atlas.

DIFFERENTIABLE MANIFOLDS

Returning to the general discussion, we observe that the functions fi are
not completely independent of one another. In fact, it follows from the definition (2.1) that we have

Ii <Pi <pjl = I;
0

0

on

<Pj(Ui

n Uj).

(2.2)

[Thus in the example cited above we indeed have f2(Y) = fl(y/llyI12), as is
required by (2.2).]
We now come to a simple but important observation. Suppose we start
with a collection of functions {fi}, eachfi defined on <Pi(Ui), and such that (2.2)
holds. Then there exists a unique function f on M such that Ii = f 0 <pil. In
fact, define f by setting f(p) = fi (<Pi(p) if p E U i. For f to be well defined, we
must be sure that this definition is consistent, i.e., that if p is also in Uj, then
fi(<Pi(p) = I;(<pj(p), but this is exactly what (2.2) says.
We can thus think of a real-valued function in two ways: as either
i) an object defined invariantly on M, i.e., a map from M to ~, or
ii) a collection of objects (in this case functions) one defined for each chart
and satisfying certain "transition laws", namely (2.2).
This dual way of looking at objects on M will recur quite frequently in what
follows.
Let M be a set with an atlas of class Ck • We will say that a function f is of
class C l (l ~ k) if each of the functions Ii defined by (2.1) is of class C l • Note
that since l ~ k, this can happen without any interference from (2.2). If Ii E Cl
and <pil 0 <Pj E Ck (k ~ l), then fi 0 (<pi l 0 <Pj) E C l. If l were larger than k,
then in general fi would not be of class Cl if I; were, and there would be very
few functions of class Cl •
Since we will not wish to constantly specify degrees of differentiability of
our atlas, from now on when we speak of an atlas we shall mean an atlas of class Coo.
Let M be a set with an atlas <t. We shall say that a sequence of points
{Xi E M} converges to X E M if
i) there exists a chart (U i , <Pi) E a and an integer Ni such that X E U i and
for all k > N, Xk E Ui ;
ii) <Pi(Xkh>N converges to <p(x).
Note that if (Uj, <pj) is any other chart with X E Uj, then there exists an N j
such that <Pj(Xk) E U j for k > N j and <Pj(Xk) ---? <pj(x). In fact, choose N j so
that <Pi(Xk) E <Pi(Ui n Uj) for all k ~ N j. (This is possible since <Pj(Ui n Uj)
is open by AI.) The fact that the <Pj(Xk) converge to <Pj(x) follows from the
continuity of <Pj 0 <pil. It thus makes good sense to say that {Xk} converges to x.
Warning. It does not make sense to say that a sequence {Xk} is a Cauchy
sequence. Thus, for example, let M = sn with the atlas described above. If {Xk}
is a sequence of points converging to the north pole in sn, then <PI (Xk) ---? 0,
while <P2(Xk) ---? 00. This example becomes even more sticky if we remove the
north pole, i.e., let M = sn - {-< 0, ... , 0, 1 > } and define the charts as before.

Then {Xk} has no limit (in M). Clearly,
{IP2(Xk)} is not.

{IP1 (Xk)}

is a Cauchy sequence, while

Once we have a notion of convergence, we can talk about such things as
open sets and closed sets. We could also define them directly. For instance, a set
U is open if IPi(U n U i ) is an open subset of IPi(Ui ) for all charts (U i , IPi), and so on.

EXERCISES

2.1 Show that the above definition of a set's being open is consistent, i.e., that there
exist nonempty open sets. (In fact, each of the U/s is open.)
2.2 Show that a sequence {xc>} converges to x if and only if for every open set U
containing x there is an Nu with Xc> E U for a > Nu.

Let a = {CUi, IPi)} be an atlas on M, and let U be an open subset of M relative
to this atlas. Let a f U be the collection of all pairs (Ui n U, IPi f U). It is
easy to check that a f U is an atlas on U. We shall call it the restriction of
a to U.
Let f be a function defined on the open set U. We say that f is of class Cl
on U if it is of class Cl relative to the atlas (1, f U on U. For later convenience
we shall say that a function f defined on a subset of M is of class Cl if
i) the domain of f is some open set U of M, and
ii) f is of class Cion U.

3. DIFFERENTIABLE MANIFOLDS

In our discussion of the examples in Section 1, the particular choice of atlas that
we made in each case was rather arbitrary. We could equally well have introduced a different atlas in each case without changing the class of differentiable
functions, or the class of open sets, or convergent sequences, and so on. We
therefore introduce an equivalence relation between atlases on M:
Let (1,1 and (1,2 be atlases on M. We say that they are equivalent if their
union (1,1 U (1,2 is again an atlas on M.
The crucial condition is that Al still hold for the union. This means that
for any charts (U i , IP;) E (1,1 and (Wi> "'j) E (1,2 the sets IPi(Ui n Wj) and
"'j(U i n Wj) are open and IPi 0 ",;1 is a differentiable map of "'j(U i n Wj) onto
IPi(Ui n Wj) with a differentiable inverse.
It is clear that the relation introduced is an equivalence relation. Furthermore, it is an easy exercise to check that if f is a function of class Cl with respect
to a given atlas, it is of class Cl with respect to any equivalent one. The same is
true for the notions of open set and convergence.

DIFFERENTIABLE MANIFOLDS

Definition 3.1. A set M together with an equivalence class of atlases on M is
called a differentiable manifold if it satisfies the "Hausdorff property": For any
two points Xl ¢ x2 ofM there are open sets Uland U2 with Xl E UI andX2E U2 with
UI n U2 = 0.
In what follows we shall (by abuse of the language) denote a differentiable
manifold by M, where the equivalence class of atlases is understood. By an
atlas of M we shall then mean an atlas belonging to the given equivalence class,
and by a chart of M we shall mean a chart belonging to some atlas of M.
We sha.ll also adopt the notational convention that V is the Banach space
where the charts on M take their values (and shall say that M is a V-manifold).
If there are several manifolds, M 1, M 2, etc., under discussion, we shall denote
the corresponding vector spaces by VI, V 2, etc. If V = Rn, we say that M is
an n-dimensional manifold.
Let M 1 and M 2 be differentiable manifolds. A map cp: M 1 ~ M 2 is called
continuous if for any open set U 2 eM 2 the set cp-1(U 2) is an open subset of MI'
Let X2 E M 2, and let U 2 be any open set containing X2' If CP(X1) = X2, then
cp-1(U 2) is an open set containing Xl. If (W, a) is a chart about Xl, then
W n cp-1(U 2) is an open subset of W, and a(W n cp-1(U 2») is an open set in VI
containing a(xI)' Therefore, there exists an E > 0 such that cp(x) E U 2 for all
X E W, with Ila(x) - a(xl)1I < E. In this sense, all points "close to Xl" are
mapped "close to X2". Note that the choice of E will depend on the chart (W, a)
as well as on Xb X2, U 2, and cpo
If M b M 2, and M 3 are differentiable manifolds, and if cp: M 1 ~ M 2 and
"': M 2 ~ M 3 are continuous maps, it is easy to see that their composition
'" 0 cp is a continuous map from M 1 to M 3'
Let cp be a continuous map from M 1 to M 2. Let (W b aI) be a chart on M 1
and (W 2, (2) a chart on M 2. We say that these charts are compatible (under cp)
if cp(W 1) c W 2. If a 2 is an atlas on M 2 and al is an atlas on M b we say that al
and a2 are compatible under cp if for every (W b al) E al there exists a
(W 2, (2) E a 2 compatible with it, i.e., such that cp(W 1) c W 2. (Note that the
map a2 0 (cp f WI) 0 all is then a continuous map of an open subset of VI into
V 2') Given a 2 and cp, we can always find an al compatible with a2 under cpo
In fact, let a'l be any atlas on M b and set
al

where (W 11 a) ranges over all charts of a'i and (W 2, (3) ranges over all charts

In order to check that a continuous map tp is differentiable, it suffices to

Then tp is differentiable.

In this section we are going to construct an "approximating vector space" to a

formulate most of the notions of the differential calculus on manifolds.
Let 111 be a differentiable manifold, and let x be a point of 111 (Fig. 9.6).
Lei I C IR be an interval containing the origin. Let <p be a differentiable map
of I into 111 such that <p(O) = x. We will call <p a (differentiable) curve through x.
Let f be any differentiable real-valued function on 111 defined in a neighborhood of x. Then <p*[fl is differentiable on IR and we can consider its derivative
at the origin. Define the operator D", by

It is easy to check that,...., is an equivalence relation. An equivalence class

If we set <I> = a 0 cp and F = f 0 a-I, then <I> is a parametrized curve in a Banaeh
space and F is a differentiable function there. We can thus write

D",(f) = dF(<I>'(O))

=

D~'(o)F.

From this expression we see (setting '11 = a 0 if;) that if; '" cp if and only if
<1>'(0) = '11'(0). We thus see that in terms of a chart (W, a), every tangent.
vector ~ at x corresponds to a unique vector ~O! E V given by
~a = (a 0 cp),(O),
where cp E ~.
Conversely, given any v E V, there is a tangent vector ~ with ~O! = /'
In fact, define cp by setting cp(t) = a-I (a(x)
tv). Then cp is defined in a sma.ll
enough interval about 0, and (a 0 cp)' = v.
In short, a choice of chart allows us to identify the set of all tangent vector:;

V 2 via (3, then 1/Iu becomes identified with the linear map JIJoy,oa-1(a(x»). In
particular, the map t/I*x is a continuous linear mapping from Tx(M 1) to T y,(x)(M 2)'
If cp: M 1 -+ M 2 and t/I: M 2 -+ M 3 are two differentiable mappings, then it

We have seen that the choice of chart (U, a) identifies Tx(M) with V.
Now suppose that M is actually V itself (or an open subset of V) regarded as a
differentiable manifold. Then M has a distinguished chart, namely (M, id).
Thus on an open subset of V the identity chart gives us a distinguished way of
identifying Tx(M) with V. It is sometimes convenient to picture Tx(M) as a
copy of V whose origin has been translated to x. We would then draw a tangent
vector at x as an arrow originating at x. (See Fig. 9.8.)
Now suppose that M is a general manifold and that 1/1 is a differentiable map
of M into a vector space VI' Then 1/1* (Tx(M») is a subspace of TY,lX)(V 1),
If we regard t/I*(Tx(M» as a subspace of VI and consider the corresponding
hyperplane through x, we get the "plane tangent to 1/I(M) at x" in the intuitive
sense (Fig. 9.9).

a = {(Ub 81), (U 2 , 82 )}, the map cp is given by

x = <1,0>- and ta = 1l'/2, then x f1. U 1 and cp(x, 1l'/2) f1. U 2. This is e~sily
remedied by the introduction of a third chart.) It is easy to see that cp is a oncparameter group.
Example 4. Let M = 8 1 X 8 1 be the torus, and let a and b be real numbers.
Write x E M as x = <Xb X2>-, where Xi E 8 1• Define cp<a,b> by

where cpa and cpb are given in Example 3. Then cp<a,b> is a one-parameter group
and indeed a rather instructive one. The reader should check to see that essentially different behavior arises according to whether b/a is rational or irrational.
[The construction of Example 4 from Example 3 can be generalized as
follows. If cp: M X ~ ~ M and 1/1: N X ~ ~ N are one-parameter groups,

can regard as the infinitesimal generator of the one-parameter group.

In view of condition (ii), we know that <;?x(O) = x. Thus <;?x is a curve passing
through x (see Fig. 9.13). Let us denote the tangent to this curve by X(x).
We thus get a mapping X which assigns to each x E M a vector X(x) E TxCM).
Any such map, i.e., any rule assigning to each x E M a vector in Tx(M), will be
called a vector field. We have seen that everyone-parameter group gives rise to a
vector field which we shall call the infinitesimal generator of the one-parameter
group.

Fig. 9.13

Let Y be a vector field on M, and let (U, a) be a chart on M. For each
x E U we get a vector Y(x)a E V. We can regard this as defining a V-valued
function Y a on a (U) :
Ya(v)

=

Y(a-l(v))a

for

v E a(U).

(5.1)

Let (W, (3) be a second chart, and let Y~ be the corresponding V-valued function
on (3(W). If we compare (5.1) with (4.3), we see that
Y~({3

a-lev))

=

J~ca-l(V)

0

Ya(v)

if v E a(U n W).

(5.2)

Equation (5.1) gives the "local expression" of a vector field with respect to a
chart, and Eq. (5.2) describes the "transition law" from one chart to another.
Conversely, let a be an atlas of M, and let Y a be a V-valued function defined
on a(U) for each chart (U, a) E a. Suppose that the Y a satisfy (5.2). Then for
each x E M we can let Y(x) E Tx(M) be defined by setting
Y(x)a =

Ya(a(x))

for some chart (U, a) about x. It follows from the transition law given by (4.3)
and (5.2) that this definition does not depend on the choice of (U, a).
Observe that J~oa-l is a COO-function (linear transformation-valued function)
on a(U n W). Therefore, if Y is a vector field and Y a is a V-valued COO-function
on a(U), the function Y~ will be Coo on (3(U n V). In other words, it is consistent
to require that the functions Y a be of class Coo. We shall therefore say that Y

380

DIFFERENTIABLE MANIFOLDS

is a COO-vector field if the function Y a is Coo for every chart (U, a). As in the casl'
of functions and mappings, in order to verify that Y is Coo, it suffices to check that
the Y a are Coo for all charts (U, a) belonging to some atlas of M.
Let us check that the infinitesimal generator X of a one-parameter group <{'
is a Coo-vector field. In fact, if (U, a) is a chart, then

Then <I>a is a differentiable map of a(U') X 1 - a(U), where 1= {t: It I < f:
In terms of this representation, we can write
Xa(v)

=

a!a (v, 0).

(5.;))

This shows that X is a Coo-vector field.
If we evaluate (5.3) in the case of Example 1, we get <I>id(V, t) = v + tll',
so that X id = w. In the case of Example 2 we !!:et Xid(V) = Av.
There are various algebraic operations that can be performed with vector
fields. The set of all vector fields on M forms a vector space in the obvious way.
If X and Yare Coo-vector fields, then so is aX
bY (a and b are constants),
where
xEM.
(aX + bY)(x) = aX(x) + bY(x),

Similarly, we can multiply a vector field by a function. If f is a function and X
is a vector field, we define fX by
(fX)(x)

= f(x)X(x),

xEM.

It is easy to see that if f and X are differentiable, then so is fX. It is also easy
to check the various associative laws for this multiplication.
We have seen that anyone-parameter group defines a smooth vector field.
Let us examine the converse. Does any Coo-vector field define a one-parameter
group? The answer to the question as stated is "no".
In fact, let X = a/ax l be the vector field corresponding to translation in the
xl-direction in ~n. Let M = ~2 - C, where C is some nonempty closed set.
of ~n. Then if p is any point of M that lies on a line parallel to that xl-axis which
intersects C (Fig. 9.14), then IPt(p) will not be defined (will not lie in M) for
every t.
The reader may object that M "has some
points missing" and that is why X does not
generate a one-parameter group. But we can
construct a counterexample on ~2 itself. In
fact, if we consider the vector field X on ~2
given by
Xid(X I , x 2) = (1, _(X2)2),

i) 111 X {O} C U;
ii) cp is differentiable;
iii) cp(x, 0) = x;
iv) cp(cp(x, s), t) = cp(x, s t) whenever both sides of this equation are
defined.

For x fixed, CPx(t) = cp(x, t) is defined for sufficiently small t, so that cp gives
rise to a vector field X as before. We shall call X the infinitesimal generator
of the flow cpo
As the previous examples show, there may be no t ~ 0 such that cp(x, t) is
defined for all x, and there may be no x such that cp(x, t) is defined for all t.
Proposition 5.1. Let X be a smooth vector field on 111. Then there exists a
neighborhood U of 111 X {O} in 111 X IR and a flow cp: U ---t 111 having X as
its infinitesimal generator.

Proof. We shall first construct the curve CPx(t) for any x E M, and shall then
verify that -< x, t>- f-+ cp(x, t) is indeed a flow.
Let x be a point of 111, and let (U, a) be a chart about x. Then Xa gives us
lfn ordinary differential equation in a(U), namely,
dv

and

Here the choice of the open set 0 and of f depends on a(x) and a(U). The
uniqueness part of the theorem asserts that <Pa is uniquely determined up to the
domain of definition; i.e., if <Pv is any curve defined for It I < f' with <pv(O) = v
and
d<Pv(t) = X (<p (t»)

then <pv(t) = <pa(v, t).

<pa(<pa(v, s), t)

Consider the curve <1>'\(,) defined by
<1>'\(t)

(5.5)

It is defined for It I < E, and is a continuous, in fact differentiable map of this
interval intoM. Furthermore, if we write IjJ = <1> ax O then (5.4) asserts that the
tangent vector to the curve ljJ(t + .) isX(IjJ(t)), the value of the vector field at the
point ljJ(t). We will write this condition as
1jJ,(t)

=

X(IjJ(t)).

(5.6)

Equation (5.6) is the way we would write the "first order differential equation"
on M corresponding to the vector field X. A differentiable curve IjJ satisfying
(5.6) is called an integral curve of X. We now can formulate a manifold version
of the uniqueness theorem of differential equations:
Lemma 5.1. Let 1\11:1---'> M and 1\12:1 ---'> M be two integral curves of X defined on
the same interval I. If 1\11 (8) = 1\12(8) at some point 8 E Ithen 1\11 = 1\12, i.e. 1\11 (t) =
1\12(t) for all tEl.

Proof We wish to show that the set where IjJl(t)

Details: i). Suppose that 1\11 (t +) = 1\12(t +) = Y EM. We can find a coordinate
chart (13, W) abouty, and then 13 a 1\11 and 13 a 1\12 are solutions of the same system
of first order ordinary differential equations, and they both take on the value
13(Y) at t = t +. Hence, by uniqueness for differential equations, 13 a 1\11 and 13 a 1\12
must be equal in some interval about t +, and hence 1\11 (t) = 1\12(t) for all t in this
interval. This is impossible since there must be points: arbitrarily close to t +
where 1\11(t) ;t.! 1\12(t) by the glb property of t +. This proves i). Now suppose that
1\11 (t +) ;t.! 1\12(t +). We can find neighborhoods U 1of 1\11 (t +) and U 2 of 1\12(t +) such
that U1 n U2 = 0. But then the continuity of the 1\11 imply that 1\11 (t) E Uland
1\12(t) E U2 for t close enough to t+, and hence that I\Il(t) ;t.! 1\12(t) for t in some
interval about t +. This once again contradicts the glb property of t +, proving
ii). The same argument with glb replaced by lub shows that B is empty proving
Lemma 5.1. The above argument is typical of a "connectedness argument."
We showed that the set where I\Il(t) = 1\12(t) is both open and closed, and hence
must be the whole interval I.
Lemma 5.1 shows that (5.5) defines a solution curve of X passing through
x at time t = 0, and is independent of the choice of chart in any common
interval of definition about o. In other words it is legitimate to define the curve
<Px(-) by
which defines <px(t)for It I < E. Unfortunately the E depends not only on x but
also on the choice of chart. We use Lemma 5.1 and extend the definition of <Px(·)
as far as possible, much as we did for ordinary differential equations on a vector
space in Chapter 6: For any S with Is I < Ewe lety = <Px(s) and obtain a curve
<Py(.) defined for It I < E'. By Lemma 5.1
<Py(t)

= <pX<s+t)ifls+tl <

E.

(5.7)

It may happen that Is I + E' > E. Then there will exist a t with It I < E' and
E. Then the right hand side of (5.7) is not defined, but the left is. We
then take (5.7) as the definition of <Px(s + t), extending the domain of definition
of <Px(-). We then continue: Let Ix + denote the set of all s > 0 for which there
exists a finite sequence of real numbers So = 0 < SI < ... < Sk = s and points
Xo, . • • Xk-l E M with Xo = x, SI in the domain of definition of <Px(·), X2 = <Px(SI)
and, inductively,

Tt,

+

so is Sf for 0 < Sf < s, and so is s TJ for sufficiently small
positive TJ. Thus rt is an interval, half open on the right. By repeated use of
(5.4) we define IPx(s) for s E Tt We construct r; in a similar fashion and
set Ix = It u r;. Then IPx(s) is defined for s E Ix, and I is the maximal
interval for which our construction defines IPx. For each x E M we obtain an
open interval I x in which the curve IPx(·) is defined.
Let U = UXEM{X} X Ix. Then U is an open subset of M X I. To verify this,
let (x, 8) E U. We must show that there is a neighborhood W of x and an E > 0
such that s E I x for all Is - 81 < E and x E W. By definition, there is a finite

Let 'P be a one-parameter group on M with infinitesimal generator X, and
let Y be another smooth vector field on M. For t r£ 0 we can form the vector
field
'Pi[Y] - Y

and investigate its limit as t ~ 0, which we shall call Dx Y. In Fig. 9.15 we
have shown the calculation of DyX and Dx Y for two very simple fields on the
Cartesian plane ~2. The field X is the constant field X id = 1117 so that Xf =
af/ax in terms of Cartesian coordinates x, y. The corresponding flow is given
by 'Pt(x, y) = -< x t, y>-. Thus 'Pt* = id if we identify the tangent space at
each point of the plane with the plane itself. Then Y I--t 'Pi Y consists of "moving"
the vector field Y to the left by t units. Here we have taken Y = X1l2, so that
Yf = x(8f/ay). In Fig. 9.1.5(c) we have pictured 'PiY, and have superimposed Y
and 'PiY in Fig. 9.15(d). Figure 9.15(e) represents 'PiY - Y and Fig. 9.15(f)
is (l/t){'PiY - V}, which coincides with its limit, Dx Y, since the expression is
independent of t. The one-parameter group generated by Y is -.f;t where -.f;t(x, y) =
-<x, y
tx>-. Here at any p E ~2 we have -.f;t*lll = III
t1l 2 , so that -.f;iX =
-.f;-t*X(-.f;(x») = III - t1l 2 • In Fig. 9.15(g) we have drawn -.f;iX and in Fig. 9.15(h)
we have superimposed it on X. Note that DxY = -DyX. However, these
two derivatives are nonzero for quite different reasons. The field 'PiY varies
\vith t because the field Y is not constant. The field -.f;i X varies with t because
of "distortion" in the flow 1/It. See Fig. 9.15(g) and (h). In the general case,
Dx Y will r,esult from a superposition of these two effects. We now make the
general calculation.

= dYa (a!a (v, 0))
= dYa(Xa(V)).

Here Y a is a V-valued function, so dYa is its differential at the point cf>a(v, 0).
Hence dYa(Xa(v)) is the value of this differential at Xa(v). The transformation
At = J <l>a(V,t) = d(cf>a)(v,t), so

dd~lt=o = a :~alt=o

Thus the derivative of (6.9) at t

at
d(Xa)v.

= 0 can be written as

d(Ya)v(Xa(v)) - d(Xa)v(Ya(v)) = DXa(v)Ya - Dya(v)Xa.
We have thus shown that the limit in (6.8) exists. If we denote it by Dx Y,
we can write
(6.10)
As before, we can use (6.10) as the definition of Dx Y for arbitrary vector
fields X and Y. Again, this represents the derivative of Y with respect to the
flow generated by X, that is, the limit of (6.9) where now (c.8) is only locally
defined.
From (6.10) we derive the surprising result that DxY = -DyX. For this
reason it is convenient to introduce a notation which expresses the antisymmetry more clearly, and we shall write
DxY

= [X, Y].

9.6

LIE DERIVATIVES

389

The expression on the right-hand side is called the Lie bracket of X and Y.
We have
[X, Yj = -[Y, Xj.
(6.11)
Let us evaluate the Lie bracket for some of the examples listed in the
beginning of Section 5. Let M = IRn.
Example 1. If X id = WI and Y id =
shows that [X, Yj = O.

W2

are "constant" vector fields, then (6.10)

Example 2. Let Xid(V) = Av, where A is a linear transformation, and let
Y id = w. Then (6.10) says that
[X, Yhd(V) = -Aw,

since the directional derivative of the linear function Av with respect to w is Aw.
Example 3. Let Xid(V) = Av and Yid(V) = Bv, where A and B are linear
transformations. Then by (6.10),
[X, Yjid(V) = BAv - ABv = (BA -

AB)v.

(6.12)

Thus in this case [X, Yj again comes from a linear transformation, namely,
BA - AB. In this case the antisymmetry in A and B is quite apparent.
We now return to the general case. Let cp be a one-parameter group on M,
let Y be a smooth vector field on M, and let I be a differentiable function on M.
According to (6.7),
Then

DCPt[Yl(CPj [ID - Dy(cpi[ID

cpi(Dyj) - Dyj
t
=

D{CP![~I_y}cpi[IJ -

+ Dy(cpif)

t

D y (cpiI t- I).

Since the functions cp£[j] are uniformly differentiable, we may take the limit as
t ---? 0 to obtain
Dx(Dyj) = DDxyj + Dy(Dxf)
= D[x,yJi + Dy(DxI).
In other words,
D[x,yJi = Dx(Dyj) - Dy(Dxf).
(6.13)
In view of its definition as a derivative, it is clear that Dx Y is linear in Y:
DX(aYl

+ bY2) =

aDXY l

+ bDx Y 2

if a and b are constants and X and Yare vector fields. By the antisymmetry,
it must therefore also be linear in X. That is,

a[Xl' Yj

7. LINEAR DIFFERENTIAL FORMS

Let M be a differentiable manifold. We have attached to each x EM a vector space
Tx(M). Its dual space, (Tx(M»*, is called the cotangent space to M at x, and will be
denoted by T:(M). Thus an element ofT:(M) is a continuous linear function on Tx(M);
it is called a covector.
Some explanation of the word "continuous" is in order. In the case where
M [and hence Tx(M)] is finite-dimensional, all linear functions on Tx(M) are
continuous, so no further comment is necessary. We shall be concerned primarily
with this case. More generally, let l be a linear function on Tx(M). For any

9.7

LINEAR DIFFERENTIAL FORMS

chart (U, a) about x we have identified Tx(M) with V, thus identifying ~ E Tx(M)
with ~a E V. Then 1 determines a linear function la on V by
(7.1)
If (W, 13) is a second chart, then
<~fj, lfj) = <Jaofj-l({3(X))~fj, la).

Since J aorl ({3(x)) is a continuous map of V into V, we see that la is continuous
if and only if lfj is. We shall therefore say that 1 is continuous if la is continuous
for some (and hence any) a. In this case we see that (7.1) gives us an identification of T:(l\[) with V* sending 1 into lao The last equation says that the rule
for change of charts is given by
(7.2)
Let f be a differentiable function on M, and let x EM. Then the function
on Tx(M) sending each ~ E Tx(M) into Hf) will be denoted by df(x). Thus
<~, clf(x)

= U·

It is easy to see that df E T:(l\[). In fact, in terms of a chart (U, a) about x,
<~, df(x)

=

D~(fa) (a(x)).

Note that f assigns an element df(x) of T:(lIf) to each x E lIf. A map which
assigns to each x E lJl an element of T:(lJl) will be called a covector field or a
linear differential form. The linear differential form determined by the function f
will be denoted simply by df.
Let W be a linear differential form. Thus w(x) E T:(lJl) for each x E lJI.
Let <X be an atlas of lIf. For each (U, a) E lJl we obtain the V*-valued function
w'" on a(U) defined by
for

v E a(U).

(7.3)

If (W, (3) E <X, then (7.2) says that

Wfj({3o a-lev)) = (J",orl({3o a-l(v))*w",(v)

= (Jfjo",-l(V))-l*W",(V)

for

v E a(U n W).

(7.4)

As before, Eq. (7.4) shows that it makes sense to require that W be smooth.
We say that W is a Ck-differential form if w'" is a V*-valued Ck-function for every
chart (U, a). By (7.4) it suffices to check this for all charts in an atlas. Also, if
we are given V*-valued functions w"" each defined on a(U), (U, a) E <X, and
satisfying (7.4), then they define a linear differential form W on M via (7.3).
If W is a differential form and f is a function, we define the form fw by
fw(x) = f(x)w(x). Similarly, we define WI
W2 by

+

(WI

+ W2)(X)

=

Wl(X)

DIFFERENTIABLE MANIFOLDS

Let M 1 and M 2 be differentiable manifolds, and let "': M 1 - ? M 2 be a

It therefore defines a dual map
("'u)*: T:ex/M2)

-?

T: (M1)'

(The reader can check that if l E T;Cx)(M 2), then ~ - ? (",*(0, l) is a continuous
linear function of ~, by verification in terms of a chart.)
N ow let w be a differential form on M 2. It assigns w (",(x») E T;cx) (M 2) to
",(x), and thus assigns an element ("'*x)*(w(",(x»)) E Ti(M 1) to x E M 1. We
thus "pull back" the form w to obtain a form on M 1 which we shall call ",*w.
Thus
(7.f»

Note that ",* is defined for any differentiable map as in the case of functions, not only for diffeomorphisms (and in contrast to the situation for vector
fields).
It is easy to give the expression for ",* in terms of compatible charts (U, 0')
of M 1 and (W, (3) of M 2. In fact, from the local expression for ",* we see that,
v E O'(U).

(7.6)

From (7.6) we see that ",*w is smooth if w is. It is clear that ",* preserves algebraie
operations:
(7.7)

",*(fw) = ",*(fJ",*(w).

Let 1/;: M 1 - ? M 2 be a differentiable map, and let f be a differentiable function on ]1,[2. Then (4.6) and the definition df show that
d(I/;*(fJ) = 1/;* df.

(7.10)

Let", be a flow on M with infinitesimal generator X, and let w be a smooth
linear differential form on M. Then the form ",iw is locally defined and, as in tIll'
case of functions and vector fields, the limit as t - ? 0 of

*

"'tW- w

exists. We can verify this by using (7.6) and proceeding as we did in the casp
of vector fields. The limit will be a smooth covector field which we shall call
Dxw. We could give an expression for Dxw in terms of a chart, just as w('
did for vector fields.

For the remainder of this chapter we shall assume that our manifolds are finitedimensional. Let M be a differentiable manifold whose V = IRn. If (U, a) is a

Riemann metric is smooth if the functions gij given by (9.3) are smooth for any
chart (U, a) belonging to an atlas a of M. Also, if we are given functions
gij = gji defined for each (U, a) E a such that
i) L gij(X) ~i~j > 0 unless ~ = 0 for all x E U,
ii) the transition law (9.5) holds,
then the gij define a Riemann metric on ]1.[. In the following discussion we shall
assume that our Riemann metrics are smooth.
Let if;: M 1 --+ M 2 be a differentiable map, and let m be a Riemann metric

For certain if; it does.
A differentiable map if;: M 1 --+ M 2 is called an immersion if if;*x is an injection
(i.e., is one-to-one) for all x EM 1.
If if;: M 1 --+ M 2 is an immersion and m is a Riemann metric on M 2, then we
define the Riemann metric if;*(m) on M 1 by (9.6).

Let us give some examples of these formulas. If M

then the identity

Let us see what this looks like in terms of polar coordinates in 1R2 and 1R3.

400

DIFFERENTIABLE MANIFOLDS

In IR 2 if we write
Xl

=

r cos 0,

x 2 = r sin 0,

then
dx l = cos 0 dr - r sin 0 dO,
dx 2 = sin 0 dr
r cos 0 dO,

+

so
(9.7)

Note that (9.7) holds whenever the forms dr and dO are defined, i.e., on all of
1R2 - {O}. (Even though the function 0 is not well defined on all of 1R2 - {O},
the form dO is. In fact, we can write
dO

=

Xl dx 2 - x 2 dx l
(XI)2
(X2)2 .)

+

(9.8)

In 1R3 we introduce
Xl = r cos cp sin 0,
x 2 = r sin cp sin 0,
x 3 = r cos o.

Then
dx l = cos cp sin 0 dr - r sin cp sin 0 dcp
dx 2 = sin cp sin 0 dr
r cos cp sin 0 dcp
dx 3 = cos 0 dr - r sin 0 dO.

Thus

dr 2

+ r cos cp cos 0 dO,

(9.9)

Again, (9.9) is valid wherever the forms on the right are defined, which this time
means when (X I )2
(X 2)2 ~ O.
Let us consider the map L of the unit sphere 8 2 -+ 1R 3 , which consists of
regarding a point of 8 2 as a point of 1R3. We then get an induced Riemann metric
on 8 2 •
Let us set
dcp = L* dcp,
and
dO = L* dO

+

so the forms dO and dcp are defined on U = 8 2
Then on U we can write (since r = 1 on 8 2 )

-

{<O, 0,1>-, <0,0, -1>-}.
(9.10)

We now return to general considerations. Let M be a differentiable manifold
and let C: I -+ M be a differentiable map, where I is an interval in IRI. Let t
denote the coordinate of the identity chart on l. We shall set

C'(S) = C*

(~) (s),

s E I,

so that C'(s) E TC(B)(M) is the tangent vector to the curve C at s. If (U, a) is
a chart on M and xl, ... ,xn are the coordinate functions of (U, a), then if

When there is no possibility of confusion, we shall omit the 0 C and simply write

Now let m be a Riemann metric on M. Then IIC'(t)11 = (C'(t), C'(t))1/2 is a
continuous function. In fact, in terms of a chart, we can write

V2:: %(C(t)xi'(t)xj'(t) .

IIC'(t)1I =
The integral

[ IIC'(t)11 dt

(9.11)

is called the length ofthe curve C. It will be defined if IIC' (t) II is integrable over I.
This will certainly be the case if I and IIC'(t) II are both bounded, for instance.
Note that the length is independent of the parametrization. More precisely,
let ep: J - t I be a one-to-one differentiable map, and let C I = Co ep. Then at
any r E J we have

that is,

Ci(r) = ; : C'(t).
Thus

On the other hand, by the law for change of variable in an integral we have

by

(9.12).

More generally, we say that a curve C defined on an interval I is piecewise
differentiable if
i) C is continuous;
ii) I = I I U' .. U IT and C, on each Ij, is the restriction of a differentiable
curve defined on some interval Ij strictly containing Ii'

402

9.9

DIFFERENTIABLE MANIFOLDS

(Thus a piecewise differentiable curve is a curve with a finite number of "corners".) If C is piecewise differentiable, then IIC'(t) II is defined and continuous
except at a finite number of t's, where it may have a jump discontinuity. In
particular, the integral (9.11) will exist and the curve will have a length.
Exercise. Let C be a curve mapping I onto a straight line segment in IRn in a one-toone manner. Show that the length of C is the same as the length of the segment.

Let C: [0, 1] ~ 1R2 be a curve with C(O) = 0 and C(I) = v E 1R2. If we use
the expression (9.7), we see that

IIIC'(t) II dt = IvI(r'(t))2

r'(t) dt

= Ilvll,

with equality holding if and only if 0' 0 and r' ~ O. Thus among all curves
joining to v, the straight line segment has shortest length.
Similarly, on the sphere, let C be any curve C: [0, 1] ~ 8 2 with C(O) =
(0,0, 1) and C(I) = p -:;6- (0,0, -1), and let 01 = O(C(I) ). Then

°

IIIC'(t)11 dt =

I

vi (O'(t))2 + sin 2 o(P'(t)) 2 dt

~ 101 IO'(t)1 dt.
If we let

denote the first point in [0, 1] where 0 = 01 , then

I IIC'(t) II dt ~ io

IO'(t) I dt ~ io

with equality only if <p'
and tl = 1. Thus the shortest curve joining any
two points on 8 2 is the great circle joining them.
In both examples above we were aided by a very fortuitous choice of coordinates (polar coordinates in the plane and a kind of polar coordinates on the
sphere). We shall see in Section 11, Chapter 13, that this is not accidental. We
shall see that on any Riemann manifold one can introduce local coordinates in
terms of which it is easy to describe the curves that locally minimize length.

CHAPTER 10

THE INTEGRAL CALCULUS ON MANIFOLDS

In this chapter we shall study integration on manifolds. In order to develop
the integral calculus, we shall have to restrict the class of manifolds under
consideration. In this chapter we shall assume that all manifolds M that arise
satisfy the following two conditions:
1) M is finite-dimensional.
2) M possesses an atlas ex containing (at most) a countable number of
charts; that is, ex = {(U i , (Xi)}i=1,2, ...•

Before getting down to the business of integration, there are several technical
facts to be established. The first two sections will be devoted to this task.
1. COMPACTNESS

A subset A of a manifold 1Jl is said to be compact if it has the following property:
i)

If {U,} is any collection of open sets with
ACUU"

there exist finitely many of the U" say U'I' ... , U", such that
A C U'I U ... U U",

Alternatively, we can say:
ii) A set A is compact if and only if for any family {F,} of closed sets
such that

there exist finitely many of the F, such that
A n F'I n ... n F"

=

0.

The equivalence of (i) and (ii) can be seen by taking U, equal to the complement of F,.
In Section 5 of Chapter 4 we established that if M = U is an open subset of
IRn, then A C U is compact if and only if A is a closed bounded subset of IRn.
403

404

THE INTEGRAL CALCULUS ON MANIFOLDS

10.1

We make some further trivial remarks about compactness:
iii) If A b

... ,

AT are compact, so is A 1 U ... U AT'

In fact, if {U,} covers A1 u··· U AT, it certainly covers each A j . We can
thus choose for each j a finite subcollection which covers A j . The union of these
subcollections forms a finite sub collection covering A 1 U ... U AT'
iv) If 1/;: M 1 ---7 M 2 is continuous and A eM 1 is compact, then 1/;[A] is
compact.
In fact, if {U,} covers 1/;[A], then {y;-1(U,)} covers A. If the U, are open,
so are the 1/;-1(U,), since 1/; is continuous. We can thus choose '1, ... , 'T so that

A C 1/;-1(U,J u· .. u 1/;-1 (U,),
which implies that 1/;[A] C U'I U· .. U U'T'
We see from this that if A = A1 u· .. U An where each Aj is contained
in some Wi, where (Wi, f3i) is a chart, and f3i(Aj) is a compact subset of ~n,
then A is compact. In particular, the manifold M itself may be compact. For
instance, we can write sn as the union of the upper and lower hemispheres:
sn = {x: xn+1 ~ O} U {x : xn+1 ~ O}. Each hemisphere is compact. In fact,
the upper hemisphere is mapped onto {y : Ilyll ~ I} by the map IP1 of Section 8.1,
and the lower hemisphere is mapped onto the same set by IP2' Thus the sphere
is compact.
On the other hand, an open subset of ~n is not compact. However, it can
be written as a countable union of compact sets. In fact, if U C ~n is an open
set, let
An = {x E U: IIxll ~ nand p(x, aU) ~ lin}.

It is easy to check that An is compact and that

UAn = U.
In view of condition (2), we can say the same for any manifold M under
consideration:
Proposition 1.1. Any manifold M satisfying (1) and (2) can be written as

where each Ai C 111 is compact.
Proof. In fact, by (2)

and by the preceding discussion each Uj can be written as the countable union
of compact sets. Since the countable union of a countable union is still countable, we obtain Proposition 1.1. 0

10.2

PARTITIONS OF UNITY

405

An immediate corollary is:
Proposition 1.2. Let M be a manifold [satisfying (1) and (2)], and let {U.}
be an open covering of M. Then we can select a countable sub collection
{U j } such that

Proof. Write M = UA" where Ar is compact. For each r we can choose finitely
many Ur,b Ur ,2, ... , Ur,k r so that

Ar C Ur,l u· .. U Ur,kr"

The collection

is a countable subcollection covering M. D
2. PARTITIONS OF UNITY

In the following discussion it will be convenient for us to have a method of
"breaking up" functions, vector fields, etc., into "little pieces". For this purpose
we introduce the following notation:
Definition 2.1. A collection {gj} of COO-functions is said to be a partition of

unity if

i) gi 2:: 0 for all i;
ii) supp git is compact for all i;
iii) each x E M has a neighborhood Vx such that Vx
for all but a finite number of i; and
iv)

L

gi(X)

=

n supp gi = 0

1 for all x E M.

Note that in view of (iii) the sum occurring in (iv) is actually finite, since
for any x all but a finite number of the gi(X) vanish. Note also that:
Proposition 2.1. If A is a compact set and {gj} is a partition of unity, then

An supp gi

= 0

for all but a finite number of i.
Proof. In fact, each x E A has a neighborhood Vx given by (iii). The sets
{V x} xEA form an open covering of A. Since A is compact, we can select a finite
sub collection {V 1, . . . , V r } with A C V 1 U ... U V r. Since each V k has a

nonempty intersection with only finitely many of the supp
union, and so a fortiori does A. D

THE INTEGRAL CALCULUS ON MANIFOLDS

3. DENSITIES

If we regard IR n as a differentiable manifold, then the law for change of variables

for an integral shows that the integrand does not have the same transition law
as that of a function under change of chart. For this reason we cannot expect
to integrate functions on a manifold. We now introduce the type of object that
we can integrate.
Definition 3.1. A density P is a rule which assigns to each chart (U, a) of
M a function Pa defined on a(U) subject to the following transition law:
If (W, (3) is a second chart of M, then

for v E a(U n W).

(3.1)

If a is an atlas of M and functions Pa, are given for all (U i , ai) E a satisfying
(3.1), then the Pa, define a density P on M. In fact, if (U, a) is any chart of M
(not necessarily belonging to a), define Pa by

This definition is consistent:
Pa;(aj

0

If v E a(U

n U i) n a(U n Uj),

then by (3.1),

a,-:-1 (aj

Pa;(ai

a-I (v)) Idet Ja,oa-l(v)1

0

a-I (v) ) IIdet J a;oa- I (v) I

by the chain rule and the multiplicative property of determinants.
In view of (3.1) it makes sense to talk about local smoothness properties of
densities. We will say that a density P is Ck if for any chart (U, a) the function
Pa is Ck • As usual, it suffices to verify this for all charts (U, a) belonging to some
atlas. Similarly, we say that a density P is locally absolutely integrable if for
any chart (U, a) the function Pa is absolutely integrable. By the last proposition
of Chapter 8 this is again independent of the choice of atlases.
Let P be a density on M, and let x be a point of M. It does not make sense
to talk about the value of pat x. However, (3.1) shows that it does make sense
to talk about the sign of P at x, More precisely, we say that
P

>

0 at x

if Pa(a(x))

>

0

(3.2)

f~r a chart (U, a) about x. Equation (3.1) shows that if Pa(a(x)) > 0, then
P/3({3(x)) > 0 for any other chart (W, (3) about x. Similarly, it makes sense to
say that P < 0 at x, P > 0 at x, or P ~ 0 at x.
Definition 3.2. Let P be a density on M. By the support of P, denoted by
supp P, we shall mean the closure of the set of points of M at which P does
not vanish. That is,
supp P = {x: P ~ 0 at x}.

10.3

DENSITIES

409

Let Pl and P2 be densities. We define their sum by setting
(Pl

+ P2)a =

Pla

+ P2a

(3.3)

for any chart (U, ex). It is immediate that the right-hand side of (3.3) satisfies
the transition law (3.1), and so defines density on M.
Let P be a density, and let f be a function. We define the density fp by
(3.4)

Again, the verification of (3.1) is immediate in view of the transition laws for
functions.
It is clear that
(3.5)
supp (Pl
P2) C supp Pl U supp P2
and
(3.6)
supp (fp) = suppf n supp p.
We shall write
if P2 - Pl 2: 0 at x
Pl ::; P2 at x
and
if Pl::; P2 at all x E M.
Pl ::; P2

+

Let P denote the space of locally absolutely integrable densities of compact
support. We observe that P is a vector space and that the product fp belongs
to P if f is a (bounded) locally contented function and pEP.
TheoreIn 3.1. There exists a unique linear function f on P satisfying the
following condition: If pEP is such that supp pC U, where (U, ex) is a
chart of M, then
(3.7)
p = (
Pa.

Proof. We first show that there is at most one linear function satisfying (3.7).
Let a be an atlas of M, and let {gj} be a partition of unity subordinate to a.
For each} choose an iU) so that
supp gj C

Ui(j).

Write P = 1· P = L gj' p. Since supp P is compact, only finitely many
of the terms gjp are not identically zero. Thus the sum is finite. Since f is linear,

By (3.7),
Thus

Thus

f,

we must show that (3.8) defines a linear function on P satisfying (3.7). The
linearity is obvious; we must verify (3.7).

We can derive a number of useful properties of the integral from the formula (3.8):
(3.10)
In fact, since (lj 2:: 0, we have «(ljPl)", :::; «(ljP2)", for any chart (U, a).
Thus (3.10) follows from the corresponding fact on IR n if we use (3.8).
Let us say that a set A has content zero if A C A I U ... U Ap where each
Ai is compact, A, C U i for some chart (U i , ai), and ai(A,) has content zero ill
IRn. It is easy to see that the union of any finite number of sets of content zero
has content zero. It is also clear that the function eA is contented.
Let us call a set B C J1[ contented if the function eB is contented. For any

Lp=O

for any pEP if A has content zero. We can thus ignore sets of content zero for
the purpose of integration. In practice, one usually takes advantage of this when
computing integrals, rather than using (3.8). For instance, in computing an
integral over sn, we can "ignore" any meridian: for example, if
A = {x E sn : x = (t, 0, ... , ±yr=t2) E IR n + I },
then

This means that we can compute

It is worth observing that if N is a differentiable manifold of dimension less
than dim M and if; is a differentiable map of N ~ M, then Proposition 7.3 of
Chapter 8 implies that if A is any compact subset of N, then if;(A) has content
zero in M. In this sense, one can ignore "lower-dimensional sets" when integrating on M.
4. VOLUME DENSITY OF A RIEMANN METRIC

Let M be a differentiable manifold with a Riemann metric o. We define the
density 0' [=0'(0)] as follows. For each chart (U, a) with coordinates Xl, ••• , xn
let

If M is an open subset of Euclidean space with the Euclidean metric, then
the volume density, when integrated over any contented set, yields the ordinary
Euclidean volume of that set. In fact, if x I, . . . , Xn are orthonormal coordinates
corresponding to the identity chart, then gij(X) = 0 if i ~ j and gii = 1, so
that Uid == 1 and thus

L = L1 = }L(A).

More generally, let 'P be an immersion of a k-dimensional manifold Minto
IR n such that 'P(M) is an open subset of a k-dimensional hyperplane in IR n, and
let m be the Riemann metric induced on M by 'P. Then, if U denotes the corre-

sponding volume density, fA U is the k-dimensional Euclidean volume of 'P(A).
In fact, by a Euclidean motion, we may assume that 'P maps M into IRk C IRn.
Then, since 'P is an immersion and M is k-dimensional, we can use x I, . . . , Xk
as coordinates on M and conclude, as before, that U is given by the function in
terms of these coordinates, and hence that fA U = }L('P(A).
Now let 'PI and 'P2 be two immersions of M ~ IRn. Let (U, a) be a coordinate
chart on M with coordinates y\ ... ,yk. If mI is the Riemann metric induced
by 'Pi, then

RO}1ghly speaking, this means that if CPt and CP2 are close, in the sense that their
derivatives are close, then the densities they induce are close.
We apply this remark to the following situation. We let CPt be an immersion
qf Minto IR" and let (W, a) be some chart of M with coordinates yt, ••• , yk.
We let U = W - C = UUz, where C is some closed set of content zero and
such that Uz n Uz' = 9J if Z ¢ l'. For each Z let be a point of Ui whose
coordinates are -< yl, ••• , y~ > , and for z = -< y t, . . . , yk> define CP2 by setting,

THE INTEGRAL CALCULUS ON MANIFOLDS

If the Uz's are sufficiently small, then

II:~~ - ~~!II
will be small. More generally, we could choose CP2 to be any affine linear map
approximating CPl on each U z• We thus see that the volume of W in terms of the
Riemann metric induced by cP is the limit of the (suljace) volume of polyhedra
approximating cp(W). Here the approximation must be in the sense of slope
(Le., the derivatives must be close) and not merely in the sense of position.
The construction of the volume density can be generalized and suggests an
alternative definition of the notion of density. In fact, let P be a rule which
assigns to each x in M a function, Px, on n tangent vectors in Tx(M) subject to
the rule
(4.2)
where ~i E Tx(M) and A: Tx(M) ~ Tx(M) is a linear transformation. Then
we see that P determines a density by setting
Pa(a(x))

=

P

(a~l (x), ... 'a~n (X))

(4.3)

if (U, a) is a chart with coordinates uI, ... ,un. The fact that (4.3) defines a
density follows immediately from (4.2) and the transformation law for the
a/au i under change of coordinates.
Conversely, given a density P in terms of the Pa, define p(a/auI, ... , a/au n)
by (4.3). Since the vectors {a/aUi}i=l, ... ,n form a basis at each x in U, any
6, ... , ~n in Tx(M) can be written as

a

~i=B-a. (x),

u'

where B is a linear transformation of Tx(M) into itself. Then (4.2) determines
p(6, ... , ~n) as
(4.4)
p(6, ... , ~n) = Idet BIPa(a(x)).
That this definition is consistent (i.e., doesn't depend on a) follows from (4.2)
and the transformation law (3.1) for densities.

Proof. It suffices to prove (5.3) for the case

supp P C cp( U)
for some chart (U, a) of M 1 with cp(U) C W, where (W, (3) is a chart of M 2.
In fact, the set of all such cp( U) is an open covering of J],f 2, and we can therefore
choose a partition of unity {gj} subordinate to it. If we write P = L gjP, then
the sum is finite and each gjp has the observed property. Since both sides of (5.3)

that each of the functions aij(t) is differentiable. We can therefore find a constant

6. THE DIVERGENCE THEOREM

Let <P be a flow on a differentiable manifold M with infinitesimal generator X.
Let p be a density belonging to P, and let A be a contented subset of M. Then
for small values of t, we would expect the difference f"'t(Al P - fA P to depend
only on what is happening near the boundary of A (Fig. lOA). In the limit,
we would expect the derivative of f<P,cAl p at t = 0 (which is given by
fA div <X, p» to be given by some integral over aA. In order to formulate
such a result, we must first single out a class of sets whose boundaries are sufficiently nice to allow us to integrate over them. We therefore make the following
definition:
Definition. Let M be a differentiable manifold, and let D be a subset of M.
We say that D is a domain with regular boundary if for every x E M there is a

chart (U, ex) about x, with coordinates x!, ... ,x:, such that one of the
following three possibilities holds:
i) Un D = 50;
ii) U c D;
iii) cx(U n D) = exCU) n {v = <Vi, ... I vn > E IRn : V n ~ O}.

420

10.6

THE INTEGRAL CALCULUS ON MANIFOLDS

Note that if x G!: TI, we can always find a (U, a) about x such that (i) holds.
If x E int D, we can always find a chart (U, a) about x such that (ii) holds.
This imposes no restrictions on D. The crucial condition is imposed when
x E aD. Then we cannot find charts about x satisfying (i) or (ii). In this case,
(iii) implies that a(U n aD) is an open subset of IRn-1 (Fig. 10.5). In fact,
a(U n aD) = {v E a(U) : v n = O} = a(U) n IRn-l, where we regard IR n- 1 as
the subspace of IRn consisting of those vectors with last component zero.

a(UnaD)

Fig. 10.5

Let a be an atlas of M such that each chart of a satisfies either (i), (ii), or
(iii). For each (U, a) E a consider the map a aD: U n aD ~ IR n- 1 C IRn.
[Of course, the maps a aD will have a nonempty domain uf definition only for
charts of type (iii).] We claim that {(U n aD, a I aD)} is an atlas on aD. In
fact, let (U, a) and (W, (3) be two charts in a such that C n lV n aD ~ [25.
Let Xl, . . . ,x n be the coordinates of (U, a), and let yl, . . . ,yn be those of
(W, (3). The map f3 0 a-I is given by

On a(U

and the functions yl(xl, ... , xn-l, 0), ... ,
yn-l (xl, ... , xn-l, 0) are differentiable. This
])
shows that (f3 I aD) 0 (a aD)-1 is differentiable on a(U n aD). We thus get a manifold x
structure on aD.
I t is easy to see that this manifold structure is independent of the particular atlas of !If
that was chosen. We shall denote by L the map
of aD ~ M which sends each x E aD, regarded
Fig. 10.6
as an element of M, into itself. It is clear that
L is a differentiable map. (In fact, (U n aD, a
aD) and (U, a) are compatible
charts in terms of which a 0 , 0 (a I aD)-1 is just the map of IRn-1 ~ IRn.)
Let x be a point of aD regarded as a point of M, and let t be an element
of Tx(M). We say that t points into D if for every curve C with C'(O) = t.
we have C(t) E D for sufficiently small positive t (Fig. 10.6). In

Proof. Let a be an atlas of M each of whose charts is one of the three types.
Let {Yi} be a partition of unity subordinate to a. Write P = L YiP. This is a

finite sum. Since both sides of (6.3) are linear functions of P it suffices to verify
(6.3) for each of the summands YiP. Changing our notation (replacing YiP by p),
we reduce the problem to proving (6.3) under the additional assumption
supp pC U, where (U, a) is a chart of type (i), (ii), or (iii). There are therefore
three cases to consider.

version of the divergence theorem. Let dV be the volume density of the Riemann
metric, so that

dV(h, ... , ~n)

=

Idet ((~i' ~j»)11/2, ~i

E Tx(M),

is the volume of the parallelepiped spanned by the ~i in the tangent space (with
respect to the Euclidean metric given by the scalar product on the tangent space).
Now the map L is an immersion, and therefore we get an induced Riemann
metric on aD. Let dS be the corresponding volume density on aD. Thus, if
{Mi=l, ... ,n-l are n - 1 vectors in Tx(aD), dS(~b ... , ~n-l) is the (n - 1)dimensional volume of the parallelepiped spanned by L*~l"'" L*~n-l in
L*Tx(aD) c Tx(M). For any x E aD let n E Tx(M) be the vector of unit length
which is orthogonal to L*Tx(aD) and which points out of D (Fig. 10.12). We

For any vector X(x) E TxCM) (Fig. 10.13) the volume of the parallelepiped

7. MORE COMPLICATED DOMAINS

For many purposes, Theorem 6.1 is not quite sufficiently broad. The trouble is
that we would like to apply (6.3) to domains whose boundaries are not completely smooth. For instance, we would like to apply it to a rectangle in [Rn.
N ow the boundary of a rectangle is regular at all points except those lying on an
edge (i.e., the intersection of two faces). Since the edges form a set "of dimension
n - 2", we would expect that their presence does not invalidate (6.3). This is
in fact the case.
Let M be a differentiable manifold, and let D be a subset of M. We say
that D is a domain with almost regular boundary if to every x E M there is a
chart (U, a) about x, with coordinates xl, ... ,x~, such that one of the following
four possibilities holds:
i)

Un D

= 0;

ii) UeD;
iii) a(U n D)

[Rn: Vk :?: 0, ... ,V n :?: O}.

The novel point is that we are now allowing for possibility (iv) where k < n.
This, of course, is a new possibility only if n > 1. Let us assume n > 1 and see
what (iv) allows. We can write a(U n aD) as the union of certain open subsets
lying in (n - I)-dimensional subspaces of [Rn-I, together with a union of
portions lying in subspaces of dimension n - 2.

We next observe the set of x E aD having a neighborhood of type (iii) forms
a differentiable manifold. The argument is just as before. The only difference
is that this time these points do not exhaust all of aD. We shall denote this
manifold by lib. Thus lib is a manifold which, as a set, is not aD but only the
"regular" points of aD, that is, those having charts of type (iii).
Theorem 7.1 (The divergence theorem).

Let M be an n-dimensional
manifold, and let D C M be a domain with almost regular boundary.
Let lib be as above, and let i be the injection of lib --7 M. Then for any

Proof. The proof proceeds as before. We choose a connecting atlas of charts
of types (i) through (iv) and a partition of unity {gj} subordinate to the atlas.
We write P = L gjp and now have four cases to consider. The first three cases
have already been handled.
The new case arises when p has its support in U, where (U, a) is a chart of
type (iv). We must evaluate

The terms in the sum corresponding to i < k make no contribution to the

Note that Ai differs from HZ by a set of content zero in ~n-I (namely, where at
least one of the vl = 0 for k = l :::; n). Thus we can replace the Ai by the H~

which is exactly the assertion of Theorem 7.1 for case (iv). 0

We should point out that even Theorem 7.1 does not cover all cases for which
it is useful to have a divergence theorem. For instance, in the plane, Theorem 7.1
does apply to the case where D is a triangle. (See Fig. 10.16.) This is because
we can "stretch" each angle to a right angle (in fact, we can do this by a linear
change of variables of ~2). (See Fig. 10.17.)
However Theorem 7.1 does not apply to a quadrilateral such as the one in
Fig. 10.18, since there is no CI-transformation that will convert an angle greater
than 7r into one smaller than 7r (since its Jacobian at the corner must carry
lines into lines). Thus Theorem 7.1 doesn't apply directly. However, we can
write the quadrilateral as the union of two triangles, apply Theorem 7.1 to each
triangle, and note that the contributions of each triangle coming from the
common boundary cancel each other out. Thus the divergence theorem does
apply to our quadrilateral.
This procedure works in a quite general context. In fact, it works for all
cases where we shall need the divergence theorem in this book, whether Theorem
7.1 applies directly or we can reduce to it by a finite subdivision of our domain,
followed by a limiting argument. We shall not, however, fornmlate a general
theorem covering all such cases; it is clear in each instance how to proceed.

For any differentiable curve C: [a, bl ----i M \ye can consider the integral

Thus a linear differential form is something we can integrate over "oriented"
curves of ]1.1 and is independent of the parametrization. In this chapter ,ye shall
introduce objects \yhich can be integrated over "oriented k-dimensional surfaces"
of M and study their properties.
1. EXTERIOH DIFFEHENTIAL FOHMS

We defined a linear differential form to be a rule which assigns an element of
T;(M) to each x E M. We can regard T;(M) as a 1 (Tx(M)). In view of this,
we make the following generalization of this definition. By an exterior differential form of degree q on III we mean a rule which assigns an clement of
aq(Tx(M)) to each x E M. If W is an exterior form of degree q and (U, a) is a
chart, then, since a identifies each Tx(il1) with V for x E U, we obtain an
aq (V)-valued function, W,,' on a( U) defined by
if v

=

a(x) and ~1,

... ,

~q E Tx(M).

It is easy to write down the transition laws. In fact, if (W, (3) is a second
chart, we have
WiJ((3(x))(~J, ... , ~~) = w(X)(~l, ... , ~q) = w,,(a(x))(~;, ... , ~:D

or, since ~iJ

=

JiJo,,-l(a(x))(~,,) for ~ E Tx(I1f), we see that

w,,(v)(~;, ... , ~~) = WiJ((3

a- 1(v)) (JiJo,,-l(vH~, ... ,JiJo,,-l(vH':x).

(1.1)

In order to write (1.1) in a less cumbersome form, we introduce the following
notation. Let V 1 and V 2 be vector spaces, and let l: V 1 ---7 V 2 be a linear map.
429

430

We define (iP(l) to be the linear map of (iP(Y 2)

(iP(V I) given by

(iP(l)(w)(vr, . .. , vp) = w(l(vI), ... ,1(vp))

for all 10 E (iP(V 2) and VI, ... ,Vp E VI. Note that under the identification of
(i I (V) with V* the map (i I (l) coincides with the map 1*:
- 7 V~. Note also
that if WI Eo (iP(V 2) and 102 E (iq(v 2), then

V;

(iP(l)n' l 1\ (iQ(l)U'2 = (ip+q(l)(wl 1\ W2)'

This follows directly from the definitions. Also, if / 1 : V I
then

(1.3)
It is clear that if 1 depends differentiably on some parameters, then so does
(iP(l) for any p.
We can now write (1.1) as

(1.1')
It is clear from (1.1') that it is consistent to require that w" be a smooth
function. We therefore say that W is a smooth differential form if all the functions
w" are C'" on O'.(U) for all charts (U, 0'.). As usual, it suffices to verify this for all
charts in an atlas. We let /\ q(l'tJ) denote the space of all smooth exterior forms
of degree q.
Let WI E /\P(M) and W2 E /\q(M). We define the exterior (p
q)-form
WI 1\ W2 by
for all x E l'tJ.

+

+

It is easy to check that WI 1\ W2 is a smooth (p
q)-form. We thus get a multiplication on exterior forms. To make the formalism complete, it is convenient
to denote the space of differentiable functions on l'tJ by /\ O(]I.f) and to denote
the product of a function f and a p-form W by fw or f 1\ w. This product is
given by
for all x E M.
(f 1\ w)(x) = (fw)(x) = f(x)w(x)

We have thus defined, for all 0 ~ p ~ nand 0 ~ q ~ 11, a multiplication
sending WI E /\P(M) and W2 E /\q(M) into WI 1\ W2 E /\p+q(M) (where
WI 1\ W2 == 0 if p + q > n = dim M). The rules for the 1\ -product on antisymmetric tensors carryover and thus, for instance,
WI 1\ (W2 1\ W2) = (WI 1\ W2) 1\ W3,
WI 1\ (W2

+ W3)

= WI 1\ W2

+ WI

1\ W3,

and so OIl.
Let M I and M 2 be differentiable manifolds, and let cp: M I - 7 M 2 be a
differentiable map. For each W E / \ q (M 2) we define the form cp*w E /\q(M I) by
cp*w(x) = (iq (cp*x)(

we cp(x)) ).

(1.4)

11.1

EXTERIOR DIFFERENTIAL FORMS

431

It is easy to check that cp*w is indeed an element of /\ q(M 1), that is, it is a
smooth q-form. Note also that (7.5) of Chapter 9 is a special case of (l.4)-the
case q = 1. (If we make the convention that a°(l) = id, then the case q = 0
of (1.4) is the rule for pullback of functions.)
It follows from (1.4) that cp* is linear, that is,

(1.5)
and from (1.2) that

If cp is a one-parameter group on a manifold M with infinitesimal generator

exists for any W E /\ q(M). The proof of the existence of this limit is straightforward and will be omitted. We shall derive a useful formula allowing a simple
calculation of Dxw in Section 3.
Let us now see how to compute with the /\ q(M) in terms of local coordinates.
Let (U, a) be a chart of M with coordinates xI, .. . , xn. Then dx i E /\1(U)
(where by /\ q(U) we mean the set of differentiable q-forms defined on U).
For any it, ... , i q the form dX il 1\ ... 1\ dx iq belongs to /\q(U), and for every
x E U the forms
{(dX il 1\ ... 1\ dxiq)(X)}i1<"'<iq
form a basis for aq(Tx(M). From this it follows that every exterior form
of degree q which is defined on U can be written as

to do the substitutions directly than to use (1.14).
2. ORIENTED MANIFOLDS AND
THE INTEGRATION OF EXTERIOR DIFFERENTIAL FORMS

Let lvI be an n-dimensional manifold. Let (U, a) and (W, (3) be two charts on lvI
with coordinates xl, ... , xn and yl, ... ,yn. Let w be an exterior differential
form of degree n. Then we can write
on

U

and
w = b dyl 1\ ... 1\ dyn

where the functions a and b are related on U n W by (1.11), which, in this case
(q = n), becomes

(2.2)

Note that (2.2) and (2.1) look almost the same; the difference is the absolutevalue sign that occurs in (2.2) but not in (2.1). In particular, if (U, a) and
(W, (3) were such that det J fjoa-l > 0, then (2.2) and (2.1) would agree for this
pair of charts.

434

11.2

EXTERIOR CALCULUS

This leads us to the following definition: An atlas a of M is said to be
oriented if for any pair of charts (U, a) and (W, (3) of a we have
detJj3o",-l(a(x))

>

0

for all

x E U n W.

There is no guarantee that there exists an oriented atlas on a given manifold M.
In fact, it is not difficult to show that there does not exist an oriented atlas on
certain manifolds. (An example of a manifold possessing no oriented atlas is
the Mobius strip.)
We say that a manifold M is orientable if it has an oriented atlas.
Let M be an orientable manifold, and let a l and a 2 be two oriented atlases.
We say that a l and a 2 have the same orientation, and write al 0' a 2 , if a l U a 2
is again an oriented atlas. To say that a l 0' a 2 meabs that for any (U, a) E a l
and any (W, (3) E a 2 we have
det Jj3o",-l(V)

>

0

on

a(U

n W).

It is clear that 0' is an equivalence relation. An equivalence class of oriented
atlases is called an orientation of M. An orientable manifold, together with a
choice of orientation, will be called an oriented manifold. We shall denote an
oriented manifold by M. That is, M is a manifold M together with a choice
of orientation. Thus an oriented one-dimensional manifold has a preferred
direction at each point (Fig. 11.1); an oriented two-dimensional manifold has a
notion of clockwise versus counterclockwise direction (Fig. 11.2); and at any
point of an oriented three-dimensional manifold we can distinguish between
right- and left-handedness.

Fig. 11.1

Fig. 11.2

In general, let M be an oriented manifold, and let (U, a) be a chart of M
with coordinates xl, ... ,xn. We say that (U, a) is a positive chart if Jj3o",-l > 0
for any chart (W, (3) belongi~g to any oriented atlas defining (i.e., belonging to)
the orientation. (It suffices to check this, of course, for all (W, (3) belonging to
one fixed atlas defining the orientation.) Note that if U is connected, then if
(U, a) is not positive, then the chart (U, a l ), where

is a positive chart.
We shall say that (U, a) is a negative chart if det J j3o",-l < 0 for all (W, (3)
belonging to an atlas defining the orientation. (Thus, if U is connected, thell
(U, a) must be either positive or negative.)

11.2

THE INTEGRATION OF EXTERIOR DIFFERENTIAL FORMS

435

We now return to our initial observation comparing (2.1) with (2.2).
Proposition 2.1. Let l\1 be an oriented n-dimensional manifold.

We can
identify exterior forms of degree n with densities by sending the form w
into the density pW, where for any positive chart (U, a) with coordinates
Xl, . . . , x n , the function
is determined by

p:

w = p:(a(.)) dx l 1\ ... 1\ dxn

on

U.

(2.3)

Another way of writing (2.3) is

w(a/ax l ,

.•. ,

a/ax n) = p(a/ax l ,

..• ,

a/axn).

(2.3')

In other words, if w = a clx l 1\ ... 1\ clx" on U, then p~(v) = aa. That pW
is really a density follows from the fact that (2.2) reduces to (2.1) for all pairs
of charts belonging to a positive atlas.
It is clear that this identification is additive,
(2.4)

and that for any fUllction,
(2.5)

Furthermore, if w(x) = 0, then pW = 0 at x. By the support of a differential
form we mean, as usual, the closure of the set of x for which w(x) ~ O. We say
that an n-form w is locally absolutely integrable if the density pW is locally
absolutely integrable. Note that to say that w is locally absolutely integrable
means that for any chart (U, a), with coordinates Xl, . . . ,x n of some atlas ex, if

w

=

a dx l 1\ ... 1\ clxn

on

U,

then the function aa = a 0 a- l is an absolutely integrable function on a(U).
Let r(M) denote the space of absolutely integrable n-forms of compact support.
It is clear that r(M) is a vector space and that fw E r(M) if f is a (bounded)
contented function and wE r(M). As a consequence of Proposition 2.1 and
Theorem 3.1 of Chapter 10, we can state:
Theorem 2.1. Let M be an oriented manifold. There exists a unique linear

function f on r(M) satisfying the following condition: If supp w C U,
where (U, a) is a positive chart with coordinates xl, ... , x n , and if w =
a dx l 1\ ... 1\ clx n, then

J=1

Observe that we can write
for all

wE r(M).

The recipe for computing f w is now very simple. We break w up into small
pieces such that each piece lies in some U. (We can ignore sets of content zero

w

/\ ••• /\

dxn.

And if a is given as a = aa(xI, ... , x n), we integrate the function aa over IRn.
The computations are automatic. Thus one point that has to be checked is that
the chart (U, a) is positive. If it is negative, then f w is given by - faa.
Let M1 be an oriented manifold of dimension q, let cp: M1 ---t M2 be a
differentiable map, and let w E Aq(M 2 ). Then for any contented compact set
A C M1 the form eACP*(w) belongs to r(M 1), so we can consider its integral.
This integral is sometimes denoted by fcp(A) w; that is, we make the definition
(2.8)
If we regard cp(A) as an "oriented q-dimensional surface" in M 2, then we see
that the elements of A q(M 2) are objects that we can integrate over such
"surfaces". (Of course, if q = 1, we say "curves".)

Let us illustrate by some examples. Suppose that M 2 = IR n , and let A C IR 1

From this last expression we see that C does not have to be differentiable everywhere in order for fC([a,b]) w to make sense. In fact, if C is differentiable
everywhere on IR except at a finite number of points, and if C'(t) is always
bounded (when regarded as an element of IRn), then the function (C'(·), w) is
defined everywhere except for a set of content zero and is bounded. Thus

Now wl(x), ... , wn(x) can be any orthonormal basis of T:(M). [T:(M) has a

3. THE OPERATOR d

With every function f we have associated a linear differential form df. We can
thus regard d as a map from /\ o(M) to /\ I (l\f). As such, it is linear and satisfies
d(fd2) = f2 dfl

+ fl diz.

We now seek to define a cl: /\k(M) ~ /\k+I(.ilf) for k > 0 as well. We shall
require that d be linear and satisfy some identity with regard to multiplication,
generalizing the above formula for cl(fd2)' The condition we will impose is that
cl(WI 1\ W2) = clWI 1\ W2

+ (-l)PwI

1\ clW2

if WI is a form of degree p. The factor (-l)P accounts for the anticommutativity
of 1\. The reader should check that d is consistent with this law, at least to the
extent that d(wl 1\ W2) = (-l)pq cl(W2 1\ WI) if WI is of degree p and W2 is of
degree q.
Weare going to impose one further condition on cl which will uniquely
determine it. This condition (which lies at the heart of the matter) requires

THE OPERATOR d

some introduction. Let f be a differentiable function, and let C: I ~ M be a
differentiable curve. For any points a, bEl, the fundamental theorem of
the calculus implies that
f(C(b)) - f(C(a))

=

lb d(fd~

C) dt

=

C* df.

We can regard b and a (with ± signs attached) as the "oriented boundary"
of the interval [a, b]. Let us make the convention that "integrating" an element
of /\ O(p) is just evaluating the function at the point p. As such, the equation
above says that the integral of the "pullback" of f over the "boundary", that is,
feb) - f(a), equals the integral of the "pullback" of df over [a, b]. In some sense,
we would like to be able to say that if w is a form of degree k, then the integral
of the "pullback" of w over the k-dimensional boundary" of a (k
I)-dimensional region is equal to the integral of the pullback of dw over the (k
1)dimensional region. Without trying to make this requirement precise, let us see
what it says for the case where k = 1 and the region is a triangle in the plane.
Let cP be a smooth map of some neighborhood of the triangle ~ C 1R2 into M,
and let the vertices of ~ be mapped by cp into x, y, and z (see Fig. 11.5). The
boundary of ~ consists of three curves (segments) C b C 2 , and C a (with the
proper orientations). Let w be a linear differential form on M. We would then
expect that

If w = df, then the three integrals on the right become (by the fundamental

f(x) - fez) = O. Thus
f cp* d(df) = O. Since the triangle was arbitrary, we expect that

We now assert:
Theorelll 3.1. There exists a unique linear map d: /\k(M) ~ /\k+l(M)

EXTERIOR CALCULUS

Proof. We first establish the uniqueness of d. To do this we observe that (3.1)
implies that d is local, in the sense that if w = w' on some open set U, thell
dw = dw' on U. In fact, let W be an open set with We U, and let ep be a Coo_
function such that ep(x) == 1 for x E Wand supp ep C U. Then epw = epw' everywhere on ]1.[, and thus dlepw) = d(epw'). But, by (3.1), d(epw) = ep dw
dep /\
w = dw on W, since ep == 1 and dep = 0 there. Thus elw = elw' on W. Since W
can be arbitrary, we conclude that dw = dw' on (T.
Let (U, a) be a chart with coordinates Xl, ••• ,xn. Every wE I\k(M)
can be written as

+

on

w=

U.

Now [by induction on k, using (3.1) and (3.2)] d(elx i1 /\ ... /\ dX ik ) = O.
Thus (3.1) implies that
on

U.

(3.3)

Equation (3.3) gives a local formula for el. It also shows that d is unique. In
fact, we have shown that there is at most one operator d on any open subset
o C 111 mapping 1\k(O) ~ 1\k+1(0) and satisfying the hypotheses of the
theorem (for 0). On the set 0 n U it must be given by (3.3).
We now claim that in order to establish the existence of el, it suffices to show
that the d given by (3.3) [in any chart (U, a)] satisfies the requirement of the
theorem on I\klU). In fact, suppose we have shown this to be so. Let a be
an atlas of 111, and for each chart (U, a) E a define the operator da : I\k(U) ~
1\k+1(U) by (3.3). We would like to set clw = claw on U. For this to be consistent, we must show that claw = dpw on U n W if (W, (3) is some other chart.
But both da and cl p satisfy the hypotheses of the theorem on Un W, and they
must therefore coincide there.
Thus to prove the theorem, it suffices to check that the operator cl, defined
by (3.3), fulfills our requirements as a map of I\k(U) ~ 1\k+1(U). It is obviously linear. To check (3.2), we observe that

by the equality of mixed partials.
Now we turn to (3.1). Since both sides of (3.1) are linear in WI and W2
separately, it suffices to check (3.1) for WI = a clX i1 /\ ... /\ dx ip and W2 =

so we see that (3.1) holds. This proves the theorem. D
We can draw a number of important corollaries from Eq. (3.3).
First of all, it follows immediately that for W E /\k(M), for any k, we have
d(dw) = O.

(3.4)

(Remember we merely assumed it for k = 0.)
Secondly, let cp: M I -+ M 2 be a differentiable map. Then for W E /\k(M 2)
we have
dcp*w = cp* dw.
(3.5)
To check (3.5), it suffices to verify it for any pair of compatible charts.

4. STOKES' THEOREM

In this section we shall prove a theorem which will be a far-reaching generaliza
tion of the fundamental theorem of the calculus of one variable. It should,
perhaps, be called the fundamental theorem of the calculus of several variables
We first make some definitions.
Let D be a domain with regular boundary in a manifold M. We recall
(page 419) that each point of M lies in a chart (U, a) which is one of three types

11.4

STOKES' THEOHEM

Let (U, a) and (W, (3) be two charts of M of type (iii). Then, as on page 420,

and so

(4.1)
Furthermore, yn(xl, ... ,xn) > 0 if xn > 0, since a(U n W) n {v: vn > O} =
a(U n W n int D). Thus ayn jax n > 0 at a boundary point where Xn = O.
N ow suppose that 1\1 is an oriented manifold, and let D C M be a domain
with regular boundary. We shall make aD into an oriented manifold. We say
that an atlas a is adjusted if each (U, a) E a is of type (i), (ii), or (iii) and, in
addition, if each chart of a is positive.
If dim M > 1, we can always find an adjusted atlas. In fact, by choosing
the U connected, we find that every (U, a) is either positive or negative. If
(U, a) is negative, we replace it by (U, a'), where x~, = -x~.
If dim M = 1, then aD consists of a discrete set of points (which we can
regard as a "zero-dimensional manifold"). Each x E aD lies in a chart of type
(iii) which is either positive or negative. We assign a plus sign to x if any chart
(and hence all constricted charts) of type (iii) is negative. We assign a minus sign
to x if its charts of type (iii) are positive. In this way we "orient" aD, as shown
in Fig . 11.6.
D

+

Fig. 1I.6

If dim M > 1, we choose an adjusted (oriented) atlas on M. It then follows
from (4.1) and the fact that aynjax n > 0 that

det J(fJ ~aD)o(a ~aD)-l

>

O.

This shows that (U f aD, a f aD) is an oriented atlas on aD. We thus get an
orientation on aD. This is not quite the orientation we want on aD. For reasons
that will soon become apparent, we choose the orientation on aD so that

444

11.4

EXTERIOR CALCULUS

(U r aD, a r aD) has the same sign as (_I)n. That is, (U r aD, a r aD) is a
positive chart if n is even, and we take the orientation opposite to that determined by (U r aD, a r aD) if n is odd. We can now state our main theorem.

Theorem 4.1 (Stokes'theorem). Let M be an n-dimensional oriented manifold, and let DC M be a domain with regular boundary. Let aD denote
the boundary of D regarded as an oriented manifold. Then for any
wE !\n-I(M) with compact support we have
(

where, as usual,

L

L*W =

(4.2)

is the injection of boundary D into M.

Proof. For n = 1 this is just the fundamental theorem of the calculus.
For n > lour proof is almost exactly the same as the proof of Theorem 6.1
of Chapter 10. Choose an adjusted atlas a and a partition of unity {gj} sub-

ordinate to a. Since w has compact support, we can write
W = LgjW,

where the sum is finite. Since both sides of (4.2) are linear, it suffices to verify
(4.2) for each of the summands gJW' Since supp gjW C U, where (U, a), we
must check the three possibilities: (U, a) satisfies (i), (ii), or (iii).
If (U, a) satisfies (i), L*W = 0, since supp W n aD = 0, and

10 dw = 1M eD dw =

0,

since D n supp W = 0. Thus both sides of (4.2) vanish.
If (U, a) satisfies (ii), the left-hand side of (4.2) vanishes. We must show
that the same holds for the right-hand side. Let Xl, .•• ,x n be the coordinates
on (U, a), and write
gjW

+ an

clx 1

Then

and thus

Since gjW has compact support, the functions ai have compact support, and
we can replace the integral over ~n by the integral over O!R, where R =
-< R, ... , R> and R is chosen so large that supp ai C O!R' But writing the
multiple integral as an integral, we get

fO'!..R ~~~ =

ai( . .. , - R, ... ) = 0,

We now examine f dyjw in case (iii). The argument proceeds exactly as

This completes the proof of the theorem. 0
Theorem 4.1, like the divergence theorem, is not sufficiently broad for us to
apply to more general domams. For this purpose, we will again use the notion
of a domain with almost regular boundary.
We have already seen that the set of x E aD having a neighborhood of type
(iii) forms a differentiable manifold. (Recall that these points need not exhaust
all of aD). Similarly, if M is an oriented manifold, then this collection of points
becomes an oriented manifold (with (-1) n times the induced orientation, as
before). By abuse of language we shall denote this oriented manifold by aD.
Thus aD is an oriented manifold which, as a set, is not aD but only the "regular"
points of aD, that is, the points of ab.

Theorem 4.2 (Stokes' theorem). Let M be an n-dimensional oriented
manifold, and let D C M be a domain with almost regular boundary.
Let aD be as above, and let L be the injection of aD ---7 M. Then for any

Proof. The proof proceeds as before. We choose an adjusted atlas and a partition of unity {gj} subordinate to the atlas. We write w = L: gjW and now
have four cases to consider. The first three cases have been handled already.
The new case is where
" aj dx 1 1\ ... 1\ ---gjW = '£oJ
dx'. 1\ ... 1\ dx n,
j

'where the ---- indicates that dx j is to be omitted, has its support contained in U,
where (U, a) is a chart of type (iv). By linearity, it suffices to verify (4.2) for
each summand on the right, i.e., for
aj dx l 1\ .. , 1\ d'7ii 1\ ... 1\ dxn.

Now L*(aj dx l 1\ ... 1\ £j 1\ ... 1\ dx n) = 0 unless j ~ k, since dx P
vanishes on the piece of aD n U whose image under a lies in H;. If j < p,
then all these dx P occur, and thus L*(aj dx l 1\ ... 1\ £j 1\ ... 1\ dx n) = O.
If j > p, then L*(aj dx l 1\ ... 1\ dx j 1\ dx n) vanish everywhere except on the
portion of aD which maps under a onto H7.
On the other hand,
d(aj dx l 1\ ... 1\

On the other hand, the orientation on Hj is such that this integral has the

As before, we can apply Theorems 4.1 and 4.2 to still more general domains
by using a limit argument. For instance, Theorem 4.2, as stated, does not apply
to the domain D in Fig. 11.8, because the curves C l and C2 are tangent at P.
It does apply, however, to the approximating domain obtained by "breaking
off a little piece" (Fig. 11.9), and it is clear that the values of both sides of (4.2)
for D' are close to those for D. We thus obtain (4.2) for D by passing to the
limit. As before, we will not state a more general theorem covering these cases.
It will be clear in each instance how to apply a limit argument.

Since the statement and proof of Stokes' theorem are so close to those of the
divergence theorem, the reader might suspect that one implies the other. On
an oriented manifold, the divergence theorem is, indeed, a corollary of Stokes'
theorem. To see this, let 0 be an element of /\ n(M) corresponding to the
density p. If X is a vector field, then the n-form DxO clearly corresponds to the
density Dxp = div <X, p>-. Anticipating some notation that we shall introduce in Section 6, let X ...J 0 be the (n - I)-form defined by

5. SOME ILLUSTRATIONS OF STOKES' THEOREM

As a simple but important corollary of Theorem 4.2, we state:
Theorem 5.1. Let cp:]I.{ 1 ~ ]I.{ 2 be a differentiable map of the oriented
k-dimensional manifold Ml into the n-dimensional manifold ]I.{ 2. Let w
be a form of degree k - 1 on ]I.{ 2, and let
D C M 1 be a domain with almost regular
q
boundary on MI. Then we have
p

(5.1)
Equation (5.1) follows directly from (4.2)
Fig. 11.10
and from the fact that cp*d = dcp*.
We can regard the right-hand side of (5.1) as the integral of dw over the
"oriented k-dimensional hypersurfaces" cp(D). Equation (5.1) says that this
integral is equal to the integral of w over the (k - I)-dimensional hypersurface cp(aD).

We now give a simple application of Theorem 5.1. Let Co: [0, 1] ~ ]I.{ and
C 1 : [0, 1] ~ M be two differentiable curves with CoCO) = Cl(O) ~ p and
Co(I) = Cl(I) = q. (See Fig. 11.10.) We say that Co andC l are (differentiably)
homotopic if there exists a differentiable map cp of a neighborhood of the unit
square [0,1] X [0,1] C [R2 into ]I.{ such that cp(t,O) = Co(t), cp(t, 1) = Cl(t),
'P(O, s) = p, and cp(I, s) = q. (See Fig. 11.11.) For each value of s we get the
curve C. given by CB(t) = cp(t, s). We think of cp as providing a differentiable
"deformation" of the curve Co into the curve C l .

Proposition 5.1. Let Co and C 1 be differentiably homotopic curves, and
let w be a linear differential form on M with dw = 0. Then

But faD is the sum of the four terms corresponding to the four sides of the square.
The two vertical sides (t =

these curves into points. The top gives - fe l (because of the counterclockwise
orientation), and the bottom gives feo. Thus fe ow - fe l w = 0, proving the
proposition. 0

°

It is easy to see that the proposition extends without difficulty to piecewise
differentiable curves and piecewise differentiable homotopies. Let us say that
two piecewise differentiable curves, Co and C lI are (piecewise differentiably)
homotopic if there is continuous map cp of [0, 1] X [0, 1] ~ M such that
i) cp(O, s) = p, cp(l, s) = q;
ii) cp(t,O) = Co(t), cp(t, 1) = C 1 (t);
iii) there are a finite number of points to < tl < ... < tm such that cp
coincides with the restriction of a differentiable map defined in some
neighborhood of each rectangle [ti' ti+d X [0, 1]. (See Fig. 11.12.)
To verify that Proposition 5.1 holds for the case of piecewise differentiable
homotopies, we apply Stokes' theorem to each rectangle and observe that the
contribution of the interior vertical lines cancel one another.
We say that a manifold M is connected if every pair of points can be joined
by a (piecewise differentiable) curve. Thus IRn, for example, is connected. We
say that M is simply connected if all (piecewise differentiable) curves joining the
same two points are (piecewise differentiably) homotopic. (Note that the circle,
8 1 is not simply connected.) Let us verify that IR n is simply connected. If Co
and C 1 are two curves, let cp: [0, 1] X [0, 1] ~ IRn be given by

cp(t, s) = sC oCt)

+ (1 -

S)C 1 (t).

It is clear that cp has all the desired properties.

Proposition 5.2. Let M be a connected and simply connected manifold,
and let 0 EM. Let wE /\ I(M) satisfy dw = 0. For any x E M let
f(x) = fe w, where C is some piecewise differentiable curve joining 0 to x.
The function f is well defined and differentiable, and df = w.

SOME ILLUSTRATIONS OF STOKES' THEOREM

Proof. It follows from Proposition 5.1 that f is well defined. If Co and C l are
two curves joining 0 to x, then they are homotopic, and so feo w = fe l w.
It is clear that f is continuous, since
f(x) - fey) =

fD w,

where D is any curve joining y to x (Fig. 11.13).
To check that f is differentiable, let (U, a) be a chart about x with coordinates <Xl, ... , xn>. Then
f(x!, ... , xi

l, ... , xn) = fe w,

where C is any curve joining p to q, where a(p) = (Xl, ... , xi, ... ,x n ), and
where a(q) = (xl, ... , Xi
h, ... ,xn). We can take C to be the curve given
by
a 0 C(t) = (xl, ... , xi + ht, ... , xn).

We have thus established that every wE /V(/R n ) with dw = 0 is of the
form df. More generally, it can be established that if Q E !\k(/R n ) satisfies
dQ = 0, then Q = dw for some w E !\k-l(/R n ).
*This is not true for an arbitrary manifold. For instance, every w E !\ 1 (8 1)
satisfies dw = O. Yet the element of angle form (which is, unfortunately,
denoted by dO) is not the d of any function. The fact that d 2 = 0 shows that if
Q = dw, then dQ = O. Thus the space d[!\k-l(M)] C !\k(M) is a subspace of
the space kerk d of elements in !\k(M) satisfying dQ = O. The quotient space
kerk d/d[!\k-lj is denoted by Hk(M) and is called the kth cohomology group of
M. If M is compact, it can be shown that Hk is finite-dimensional. It measures
(roughly speaking) "how many" k-dimensional holes there are in M.*

Let M be a differentiable manifold, and let 'P be a flow on M with infinitesimal

* - W
'PtW
t
It is not difficult (using local expressions) to verify that the limit as t ---7 0 exists
and is again an element of /\k(M), which we denote by Dxw. The purpose of
this section is to provide an effective formula for computing Dxw. For this
purpose, we first collect some properties of Dx. First of all, we have that it is
linear:
(6.1)
Secondly, we have
'Pi(WI 1\ W2) -

DX(WI 1\ W2) = (DXWI) 1\ W2

+ WI

1\ DXW2.

(6.2)

Finally, since 'Pi d = d'Pi, we have
Dx dw = d(Dxw).

(6.3)

Actually, these three formulas suffice for the computation. If

Since this expression is rather cumbersome (the d(DxXi) have to be expanded and
the terms collected), we shall derive a simpler and more convenient expression
for D XW. In order to do this, we make an algebraic detour.
Recall that the operator cl: /\k(M) ---7 /\k+I(M) is linear and satisfies the
identity

(6.5)

will be called an antiderivation of the algebra A(M).
It follows from (6.5) that if WI == W2 on an open set U, then (J(WI) == (J(W2)
on U. Now about every x E lIf we can find a neighborhood U and functions
xl, ... , x n , so that wE A k(M) can be written as

(6.7)

We thus arrive at the important conclusion:
Proposition 6.1. Any antiderivation (J: Ak(M) ---+ AHI(M), k = 0, ... ,n,
is uniquely determined by its action on A o(M) and A I(M). That is, if
(JI(W) = (J2(W) for all wE AO(M) and AI(M), then (JI(Q) = (J2(Q) for
Q E Ak(M) for any k.

Now suppose we are given maps
and
which satisfy (6.5) and (6.4') where it makes sense, that is,
and

(J(fW)

= (J(f)l\lw

+ f(J(w).

(6.8)

Then any chart (U, ex) defines (J: Ak(U) ---+ AHl(U) by (6.7). This
gives an antiderivation (Ju on U, as can easily be checked by the use of the argument on pp. 440-441. By the uniqueness argument, if (W, (3) is a second chart,
the antiderivations (Ju and (Jw coincide on Un W. Therefore, Eq. (6.7) is
consistent and yields a well-defined antiderivation on A(M). (Observe that we
have just repeated about two-thirds of the proof of Theorem 3.1 for the more
general context of any antiderivation.)

t This condition is actually a consequence of (6.4). In fact, let U be an open set
containing supp w. Since {U, lIf-supp w} is an open covering of 1II, we can find a
partition of unity subordinate to it. In particular, we can find a COO-function cP which
is identically one on supp wand vanishes outside U. Then w = cpw, so that

Thus supp (J(w) C supp w U supp cp C U. Since U is an arbitrary neighborhood of
supp w, we conclude that supp (J(w) C supp w.

Also observe that in the above arguments, nothing changes if instead of
0: /\k(M) ~ /\Hl(M) we have 0: /\k(M) ~ /\k-l(M). [We take this to
mean O(f) = 0 for f E / \ O(M).] In fact, the same argument works for
0:

/\k ~ /\Hr

for any odd integer r. We can thus state:

Proposition 6.2. Let 0: AO(M) ~ Ar(M) and 0: Al(M) ~ A r + 1(M) be
linear maps satisfying (6.5) and (6.8), where r is odd. Then there exists one
and only one way of extending 0 to an antiderivation 0: A h(M) ~ A h + reM)
satisfying (6.4).
As an application of this proposition, we will attach an antiderivation
O(X): /\k(M) ~ /\ k-l(M) to every smooth vector field X on AI. Since r = -1,
for f E /\ o(M) we set
O(X)f = o.
For

w

E /\ l(M) we set

O(X)w = (X, w).

(6.9)

To verify (6.8) means to check that
O(X)(fw) = fO(X)w,

that is, that
(X, fw) = f(X, w),
which is obvious.
If f is a function and 0 is an antiderivation, we denote by fO the map which
sends w ~ fO(w). It is easy to check that this is again an antiderivation.
We can assert the following as a consequence of the uniqueness theorem:
Let X and Y be smooth vector fields, and let f and g be smooth functions. Then
O(fX

+ gY)

= fO(X)

+ gO(Y).

(6.10)

By the proposition, it suffices to check (6.10) on all w E /\l(M). By (6.9), this
is just
(fX
gY, w) = f(X, w)
g(Y, w),
which is obvious.

Thus, for example, O(ajax i ) dx P /\ dx q = 0 if neither p = i nor q = i, while
O(ajax i ) (dxi /\ dx i ) = dx i , O(ajaxi)(dx i /\ dx i ) = -dx i , etc.
Let us call a (sequence of) map(s) D: /\k(JI1) ---7 /\H8CM), where s is even,
a derivation if it satisfies (6.5) and
D(WI /\ W2) = DWI /\ W2

Since s is even, this is consistent. The most important example is Dx
where s = O. Then (6.11) is just (6.2).
All the previous arguments about existence and uniqueness of extensions
apply unchanged to derivations, as can easily be checked. We can therefore
assert:
Proposition 6.3. Let D: /\0(1'01)

---7/\ 0+8(1\f) and D: /\ I(M) ---7/\ H8(1'o1),
where s is even, be maps satisfying (6.5) and (6.8) (with 0 replaced by D).
Then there exists one and only one way of extending D to a derivation of
/\(M).

We need one further algebraic fact.

In fact, by Proposition 6.4, O(X)O(Y)
O(Y)O(X) is a derivation of degree
-2, that is, it vanishes on /\ 0 and /\ 1. It must therefore vanish identically.
We could, of course, directly verify (6.12) from the local description of O(X)
and O(Y).
As a more serious use of Proposition 6.4, consider O(X) 0 d d 0 O(X),
where X is a smooth vector field. Since d: /\k ---7 /\Hl and O(X): /\k ---7 /\k-r,
we conclude that O(X) 0 d + d 0 O(X): /\ k ---7 / \ k. We now assert the main

Since both sides of (6.13) are derivations, it suffices to check (6.13) for
fUllctions and linear differential forms. If j E 1\ o(M), then O(X)j = O. Thus,
by (6.9), Eq. (6.13) becomes
Dxj = (X, df),
which we know holds. Next we must verify (6.13) for wE I\I(M). By (6.5), it,
suffices to verify (6.13) locally. If we write w = al dx l
an dx n, it
suffices, by linearity, to verify (6.13) for each term ai dXi. Since both sides of

Since we have verified (6.13) for functions, we only have to check (6.13) for dXi.
Now

[O(X) d

This completes the proof of (6.13).
In many circumstances it will be convenient to free the letter 0 for other uses.
We shall therefore occasionally adopt the notation

The symbol .J is called the interior product. X.J w is the interior product of

We list here the relationships between notions introduced in this chapter and
various concepts found in books on "vector analysis ", although we shall have
no occasion to use them.
In oricnted Euclidean three-space 1E 3 , there are a number of identifications
we can make which give a special form to some of the operations we have
introduced in this chapter.
First of all, in 1E 3 , as in any Riemann space, we can (and shall) identify
vector fields with linear differential forms. Thus for allY function f we can
regard df as a vector field. As such, it is called grad f. Thus, in 1E 3 , in terms of
rectangular coordinates x, y, z,
gradf =

where we have also identified vector fields on 1E3 with 1E 3-valued functions.
Secondly, since 1E3 is oriented, we can, via the *-operator (acting on each Tn,
identify A 2(1E3) with A 1(1E 3). Recall that * is given by

*(dx 1\ dy) = dz,

*(dx 1\ dz) = -dy,

*(dy 1\ dz) = dx.

Appendix II. ELEMENTARY DIFFERENTIAL
GEOMETRY OF SURFACES IN 1E3

For purposes of computation, it is convenient to introduce the notion of a
vector-valued differential form. Let E be a vector space, and let M be a differentiable manifold. By an E-valued exterior differential form !l of degree p we
shall mean a rule which assigns an element !l:z; to each x EM, where !l:z; is
an antisymmetric E-valued multilinear function of degree p on T:z;(M). For
instance, if p = 0, then an E-valued zero-form is just a function on M with
values in E. An E-valued one-form is a rule which assigns an element of E to
each tangent vector ~ at any point of M, and so on.
Suppose that E is finite-dimensional and that {eb ... , eN} is a basis for E.
Let !lb ... ,!IN be (real-valued) p-forms. We can then consider the E-valued
p-form!l = !llel
!lNeN, where, for any p vectors h, ... , ~p in T:z;(M),
we have

+ ... +

!l:z;(h, ... ,

~p) =

!lIAh, ... ,

~p)el

+ ... + !IN:z;(h, ... , ~p)eN.

Conversely, if !l is an E-valued form, then real-valued forms !lb ... , !IN can
be defined by the above equation. In short, once a basis for an N-dimensional
vector space E has been chosen, giving an E-valued differential form n is the
same as giving N real-valued forms, and we can write
N

!l =

L

!liei

or

I

The rules for local description of E-valued forms, as well as the transition
laws, are similar to those of real-valued forms, so we won't describe them in
detail. For the sake of simplicity, we shall restrict our attention to the case
where E is finite-dimensional, although for the most part this assumption is
unnecessary.
If w is a real-valued differential form of degree p, and if !l is an E-valued
form of degree q, then we can define the form w /\ !l in the obvious way. In
terms of a basis, if!l = -<!lb ... ,!lN >- , then w /\ !l = -< w /\ !lb ... , w /\ !IN>-.
More generally, let E and F be (finite-dimensional) vector spaces, and let #
be a bilinear map of E X F -) G, where G is a third vector space. Let
{eb . .. ,eN}

460

It is easy to check that this does not depend on the particular bases chosen.
\Ve shall want to
this notion primarily in two contexts. First of all,
we will be interested in the case where E = F and G = IR, so that # is a bilinear
form on E. Suppose # is a scalar product and el, ... , eN is an orthonormal basis.
Then we shall write (w 1\ n) to remind us of the scalar product. If

is a ]i-form and n is a q-form, then

as in the case of real-valued forms.
The second case we shall be interested in is where F = G and E = Hom(F),
and # is just the evaluation map evaluating a linear transformation on a vector
of F to give another element of F. This time, choosing a basis for F determines a
basis for Hom(F), so we can regard was a matrix of real-valued differential forms.

is an E-valued form of degree p and n is an F-valued form.
We shall apply the notion of vector-valued forms to develop (mostly in
exercise form) some elementary facts about the geometry of oriented surfaces
in IE :l. Let 111 be an oriented two-dimensional manifold, and let 'P be a differentiable map of },1 into 1E3. We shall assume that 'P* is not singular at any point
of M, i.e., that 'P is an immersion. Thus at each point p EO JI the space 'P* (T p(M»)
is a two-dimensional subspace ofT<p(p)(1E 3 ). Since we can identify T<p(p)(1E 3 )
,'vith 1E 3 , we can regard 'P*(Tp(ilf)) as a two-dimensional subspace of 1E3.
(See Fig. 11.15.) Since M is oriented, so is the tangent plane 'P*(Tp(Nl)).
Therefore, there is a unique unit vector orthogonal to the tangent plane which,
if

W

DIFFERENTIAL GEOMETRY OF SURFACES IN

'P*(Tp(M))

Fig. H.lS

together with an oriented basis of the tangent plane, gives an oriented basis
of 1E3. This vector is called the normal vector and will be denoted by n(p). We
can consider n an 1E 3 -valued function on M. Since Ilnll = 1, we can regard n as
a mapping from M to the unit sphere. Note that cp(M) lies in a fixed plane of 1E3
if and only if n = const (n = the normal vector to the plane). We therefore can
expect the variation of n to be useful in describing how the surface cp(M) is
"bending".
Let 0 be the (oriented) area form on M corresponding to the Riemann metric
induced by cpo Let Os be the (oriented) area form on the unit sphere. Then
n*(Os) is a two-form on M, and therefore we can write
n*Os

=

KO.

The function K is called the Gaussian curvature of the surface cp(M). Note that
K = 0 if cp(M) lies in a plane. Also, K = 0 if cp(M) is a cylinder (see the exercises).
For any oriented two-dimensional manifold with a Riemann metric we
let (f denote the set of all oriented bases in all tangent spaces of M. Thus an
element of (f is given by -<iI, 12 '>, where -<fll 12 '> is an orthonormal basis of
T ",(M) for some x E M. Note that 12 is determined by fl' because of the orientation and the fact that f2 1. II. Thus we can consider (f the space of all tangent
vectors of unit length. For each x E M the set of all unit vectors is just a circle.
We leave it to the reader to verify that (f is, in fact, a three-dimensional manifold.
We denote by 7r the map that assigns to each -<fII f 2'> the point x when
-<fll f2 '> is an orthonormal basis at x. Again, the reader should verify that 7r
is a differentiable map of (f onto M.
In the case at hand, where the metric comes from an immersion cp, we define
several vector-valued functions X, el, e2, and e3 on (f as follows:
X

el ( -<It, f2 '» = cp*1t,

(In the middle two equations we regard cp* Ii as elements of 1E3 via the identification of TI"(x)1E 3 with 1E 3 .) Thus at any point z of 5', the vectors el(z), e2(z), e3(z)
form an orthonormal basis of 1E 3 , where el (z) and e2(z) are tangent to the surface
at cp(n·(z)) = X(z) and ea(z) is orthogonal to this surface. We can therefore

el and e2 span the tangent space to rp(M), so saying that fl (-) is parallel is the

that a piece of a cylinder and a piece of the plane are isometric, even though they
are not congruent by a Euclidean motion. In different terms, while the forms WI3
and W23 depend on how the surface is immersed in 1E 3 , the form WI2 depends
only on the Riemann metric induced by the immersion.
N ow we have (1I.4):

EXTERIOR CALCULUS

From this we conclude that the Gaussian curvature K also does not depend only
on the immersion, but only on the Riemann metric coming from the immersion.
Since Wl2 does not depend on C(J, we should be able to define it for an arbitrary
two-dimensional manifold with a Riemann metric. Note that the preceding
argument shows that Wl2 is uniquely determined by Eq. (11.4). It therefore
suffices to construct an W12 on a coordinate neighborhood so as to satisfy (11.4).
It will then follow from the uniqueness that any two such coincide to give a
well-defined form. Let U be a coordinate neighborhood of M, and let y;: U ---t it
be a differentiable map such that 71" 0 y; = id. Thus y; assigns a basis <11,12 >to each x E U, in a differentiable manner. (One possible way to construct y; is
to apply the orthonormalization procedure to the vector fields < ajax!, ajax 2 >-.)
Once we have chosen y;, any basis of Tx differs from y;(x) by a rotation.
If we let 7 denote the (angular) coordinate giving this rotation (so that 7 is
only defined mod 271"), then we can use the local coordinates on U together
with 7 as coordinates on 7I"-I(U). l\lore precisely, if Xl and x 2 are local coordinates on U, we define yl, y2, 7 by

As before, on any two-dimensional Riemann manifold we will call a family
of unit vectors parallel along a curve l' if (~., W12) = O. With this definition of
parallel translation we can state the following:
Theorem. Let l' be any differentiable curve on M. Given the unit vector
E T'Y(o)(M), there is a unique parallel family of unit vectors gl (s) along 1',
with gl (0) = gl. If g~ (0) is another unit vector of T'Y(O)(M) differing from gl
by an angle CT, then g~(s) differs from gl(S) by the same angle CT for all s.

gl

Proof. It is clearly sufficient (by breaking l' up into small pieces if necessary) to
prove the theorem for curves l' lying entirely in a coordinate chart. Then we
can use the local expression for W12.
Let us rewrite the condition for parallel translation along I'(s). In terms of
local coordinates, the unit vector gl (s) is given by a function r(s), where
gl(S) = cos r(s)!l (I'(s») - sin r(s)!2(I'(s»).

vector of the north pole. Compare its translates to the south pole via 1'1 and 1'2.

Let M be any two-dimensional Riemann manifold. For any curve I' on M
there is an obvious way of choosing unit vectors along 1': just let gl(S) be the
unit tangent vector to I' at I'(s). Thus for every curve I' on III we get a curve,
which we shall call y, on 5'. [Here y = (I'(s), gl(S), g2(S) and gl(S) is the
tangent to I'(s).]
We call the form y*(W12) the geodesic curvature form of 1'. [In the Euclidean
case this is just the ordinary curvature (see the exercises).]
Let us consider those curves whose geodesic curvatures vanish, i.e., those
curves whose tangent vectors are parallel. We shall call such a curve a geodesic
with respect to the given Riemann metric. Note that the condition that a curve
be geodesic is given, in local coordinates, by a second-order differential equation. Therefore, a geodesic CO is uniquely specified by giving C(t) and C'(t)
at any fixed value of t. In Chapter 13 we use the term "geodesic" to mean
a curve which locally minimizes length. It is the purpose of the next few exercises
to show that geodesics in our present sense have this property.

EXERCISES

11.4 Let x, y be local coordinates on U eM. Through each point of the curve
y = 0 (that is, the x-axis in the local coordinates), construct the unique geodesic
orthogonal to this curve. (See Fig. 11.16.) Let s be the arc-length parameter along
the geodesic, so that the geodesic passing through (u, 0) is given by
(y(u, 8), x(u,

8»).

Show that the map (u, 8) ~ (y(u, 8), x(u, 8») has nonzero Jacobian at (0,0) and
therefore defines a coordinate system in some open subset U' C U.

Thus Y is orthogonal to the geodesics u = const and points in the increasing U-direction. Let us consider the solution curves of this vector field parametrized by the initial
position along the geodesic u = O. That is, let v be the arc-length parameter along the
geodesic u = 0, and consider the map

(u, v)

~

(u, s(u, v»),

where s(u, v) is the s-coordinate of the intersection of the solution curve of Y passing
through (0, v) with the geodesic given by u. (See Fig. 11.17.) Again the existence
theorem and smooth dependence on parameters, together with the fact that the curves
u = 0 and s = 0 are already orthogonal, guarantees that we can find some neighborhood W so that (u, v) are coordinates on W. "We have thus constructed coordinates
such that the curves u = const are geodesics and the curves u = const and v = const
are orthogonal. Such a system of coordinates is called a geodesic parallel coordinate
system.

curve Cu given by Cu(v) = Cu, v) is a geodesic. Thus (CI/(v), W12) = 0. But in terms
of our local coordinates, (CI/(v) , dT) = 0, since C'(v) is always parallel to one of the
base vectors 12, and
(CI/ (v), ir*du) = (C1 (v), dU) = 0,
since u = const along C. Thus we conclude that aq/au = 0, or q = q(v). Let us

In particular, the sum of the indices of a vector field is independent of the
vector field, and the total integral of the curvature is independent of the
Riemann metric.
Thus, for instance, if It! is S2, the vector field tangent to the meridian circles
has zeros only at the north and south poles, and the index at each of these
points is +1. Thus (II. 13) says that the sum of indices of any vector field on S2
must equal 2. (In particular, it is impossible to construct a vector field on S2
which does not vanish anywhere.) Furthermore, (1I.13) says that no matter

Equation (2.5) has a number of startling consequences which we shall now
develop. Let U be a function that is harmonic in a domain U. Let Xo be some

Now suppose that W is an open set that is connected; that is, suppose that any
two points of W can be "joined by a continuous curve lying entirely in W. Let y
be any point of W, and let C be a curve joining Xo to y. About each x on the curve
we can find a sufficiently small ball with center x lying entirely in W. By the
compactness of C we can choose a finite number of these balls which cover C.
We can therefore formulate the following: There are a finite number of spheres
Sal' ... , Sak such that each sphere and its interior lie entirely in W, Sal has
center xo, the center Xi of Sam lies on Sa;, and y E Sak' (See Fig. 12.4.) But this
implies that u(xo) = U(Xl) = ... = U(Xk) = u(y). In other words, we have
established:
Proposition 3.1. Let u be harmonic in a connected open set W, and suppose
that u achieves its maximum value at some Xo E W. Then u is constant

on W.
An immediate corollary of this result is:
Proposition 3.2. Let U be a connected open set with D compact. Then if
u is a function that is continuous in D and harmonic in U,

u(x)

GREEN'S FUNCTIONS

Proof. In fact, since U is compact and u is continuous, u must achieve its
maximum at some point Xo of U. If we could actually choose Xo E U, then u
would have to be a constant by Proposition 3.1. If u is not a constant, then
Xo E au, and we have (3.1). 0

From this we deduce:
Proposition 3.3. Let U be a connected open set with U compact. Let u
and v be functions that are continuous in U and harmonic in U. Suppose
that
u(y) = v(y)
for all y E au.
Then
u(x) = vex)
foran x E U.

Proof. In fact, u - v satisfies the hypotheses of Proposition 3.2 and vanishes
on au. Thus u(x) - vex) ~ 0 for x E U. Similarly vex) - u(x) ~ 0, which
implies the proposition. 0

An alternative way of formulating Proposition 3.3 is to say that on a domain
U a harmonic function is completely determined by its boundary values. This
is a uniqueness theorem: there is at most one harmonic function with given
boundary values. It suggests the problem of deciding whether the corresponding
existence theorem is true. This problem is known as Dirichlet's problem.
Dirichlet's problem. Given a continuous function f defined on au, does
there exist a function u that is continuous in U and harmonic in U and such
that u(y) = fey) for all y E aU?

We shall show in Section 9 that we can always solve Dirichlet's problem for
domains with almost regular boundary.

(5.3)

In the proof of (5.3) we used the assumption that the function u is differentiable in some neighborhood of the ball BRand is harmonic for Ilxll < R.
Actually, all that we need to assume is that u is differentiable and harmonic for
Ilxll < R and continuous on the closed ball Ilxll ::;; R. In fact, for any Ilxll < R,
Eq. (5.3) will be valid with R replaced by R a , where Ilxll < Ra < R. If we then
let Ra approach R, we recover (5.3) by virtue of the assumed continuity of u.
Equation (5.3) gives the solution of Dirichlet's problem for a ball provided
we know that the solution exists. That is, if u is any function that is harmonic on
the open ball and continuous on the closed ball, it satisfies (5.3). Now let us
show that (5.3) is actually a solution of Dirichlet's problem for prescribed
boundary values. Thus suppose we are given a continuous function u defined on
the sphere SR. Then we are given u(y) for all y E SR. Define u(x) for Ilxll < R
by (5.3). We must show that
a) u is harmonic for Ilxll < R, and
b) u(x) ~ u(Yo) if x ~ Yo and IIYol1 = R.
To prove (a) we observe that GR(X, y) is a differentiable function of x and y
in the range Ilxll < Rl < R, Rl < Ilyll < R2/Rb and is, by construction, a
harmonic function of y. For Ilxll < Rand Ilyll < R, we know, by (4.4), that

GR(x, y)

= GR(y, x).

Thus for fixed y with Ilyll < R, GR(·, y) is a harmonic function on BR - {y}.
Letting lIyll ~ R, we see that GR(X, y) is a harmonic function of x for
IIxll < Rl < R for each fixed y E SR. Thus
aGR
vy'

"""!l'""" (x,

is a harmonic function of x for each yES R. In other words, all the coefficients
of *dG R(·, y) are harmonic functions of x for each y E SR, and therefore so is
each coefficient of u(y) * dG R(·, y). It follows that the function u(x) =
ISR U * dGR(x, .) is a harmonic function of x, since the integral converges uniformly (as do the integrals of the various derivatives with respect to x) for
Ilxll < Rl < R. This proves (a).
To prove (b) we first remark that the constant one is a harmonic function
everywhere, so Eq. (5.3) applies to it. We thus have

CONSEQUENCES OF THE POISSON INTEGRAL FORMULA

We have thus proved:
Theorem 5.1. Let u be a continuous function defined on the sphere SR.

There is a unique continuous function defined for IIxil ~ R which coincides
with the given function on the sphere S R and is hannonic for Ilxil < R.
This function is given by (5.3) for all IIxll < R.

Fig. 12.6
6. CONSEQUENCES OF THE POISSON INTEGRAL FORMULA

In the proof of Theorem 5.1 we assumed that u is continuous in the closed ball,
possesses two continuous derivatives in the open ball, and is harmonic in the
open ball. However, it is clear from (5.3) that u possesses derivatives of all
orders when Ilxll < R. In fact, if IIxll < RI < R, we can differentiate (5.3)
under the integral sign any number of times, since all the integrals we obtain
will be uniformly integrable in Ilxll. Now if u is hannonic in some open set U
and x E U, we can choose R sufficiently small so that the ball of radius R
centered at x will be contained in U. (See Fig. 12.6.) We can then apply (5.3).
We thus conclude:
Proposition 6.1. Let u be a function defined on an open set U, possessing
two continuous derivatives, and satisfying ilu == O. Then u has continuous

derivatives of all orders.
We can improve Proposition 6.1 by examining (5.3) a little more closely.
Let Ilyll = R, and let RI < R. Therefore, all Ilxll ~ R 1 • The multinomial
theorem allows us to expand
(6.1)

where the coefficients depend on y but the series converges unifonnly in x for
all Ilyll = R. Furthennore, if D is any operator of partial differentiation with
respect to x, then we obtain an analogous expansion
D{lly -

xll-n }

=

L

Bal ..... a,,(y)X~l ... x~",

where this series is obtained from (5.4) by term-by-term differentiatio:p. and
converges uniformly in the same region. If we now substitute (6.1) into (5.3),
we can integrate the series term by term because of the unifonn convergence in

486

y, and we conclude that

where the series converges uniformly for Ilxll < R I • Furthermore, we can
differentiate the series term by term. Doing this and evaluating at x = 0,
we see that
alGa = Dau(O),
where a = <aI. ... , an>.
We thus have proved:
Proposition 6.2. Let u be harmonic in the ball Ilxll

u(x) =

L

< R. Then

~
Dau(O)x",
a.

(6.2)

where the Taylor series (6.2) converges for all IIxll < R and converges
uniformly for all IIxll ::::; RI < R. In particular, u is determined throughout
the ball by its value and the value of all its derivatives at the origin.

Fig. 12.7

Let U be some connected open subset of lEn, and let u and v be two harmonic
functions on U. Suppose that u and v have the same value and the same derivatives of all orders at some point x E U. Let y be some other point of U. We
can then connect x to y by a series of balls lying in U, where the center of each
ball lies in the interior of the preceding ball, and such that x is the center of the
first ball and y lies in the last ball. (See Fig. 12.7.) We thus conclude that
u(y) = v(y).

Thus we have:
Proposition 6.3. Let u and v be harmonic functions defined on an open

connected set U. Suppose that u and v, together with all their derivatives,
coincide at some point of U. Then u == von U. In particular, if u(x) = v(x)
for all x E W, where W is some open subset of U, then u(x) = v(x) for
all x E U.

12.7

HARNACK'S THEOREM

Let D denote any operator of partial differentiation with respect to x. Thus
aa1 + ... +a n
Dau= ~~----~~~
(aX 1 )al' .. (axn)a n
Then Dau(x) is given by an integral over S R of a function involving, at worst,
inverse powers of Ily - xii for y on SR and the function u on SR. In particular,
if Ilxll < Rl < R, then we can estimate the maximum absolute value of Da u
in terms of the values of u on S R and the difference R - R 1. In short,
IDau(x)1 :::; c(D a, R, Rd max lu(y)1

for

liyli=R

Ilxll <

R 1,

(6.3)

where c depends only on 0', R, and R 1 • Now suppose that u is harmonic in some
open set U, and let Kl and K2 be compact subsets of U with

K1 C int K2 C K2 C U.
About each x

K 1 we can draw an open ball B Rx such that B Rx C int K 2 ,

SR x C K 2 •
We can also draw a ball B R,x of slightly smaller radius about x. Now the open
balls B R,x cover K 1. Since K 1 is compact, we can select a finite number of these
balls which cover K 1 • By applying (6.3) to each of these balls, replacing lu(y)1
by the larger maxzEK2 lu(z)l, and using the smallest of the finitely many constants c, we conclude that
max IDau(x)1

In particular, we have:
Proposition 6.4. Let

{Uk} be a sequence of harmonic functions defined on
an open set U that converges uniformly on any compact subset of U. Then
the sequence of partial derivatives {Da u} also converges uniformly on any
compact subset. In particular, the limit of the sequence is again a harmonic
function.

In fact, for any compact subset K 1 we can always find a compact subset K2
such that K 1 C int K 2 • Applying (6.4) to the harmonic functions u, - Uj
establishes the uniform convergence of {Da Uk } on K 1 . Since the sequence of
partial derivatives converges uniformly, flu = lim flUk = O.
7. HARNACK'S THEOREM

We continue to reap the consequences of Eq. (5.3). In addition to what we
assumed in the preceding section, let us suppose that u(y) 2: 0 for all y E SR.

sequence of balls, we deduce:
Proposition 7.1 (Harnack's theorem). Let {Uk} be a sequence of harmonic
functions defined on a connected open set U and such that

(7.2)

Suppose that the sequence {Uk(P)} converges for some p E U. Then the
sequence of functions {Uk} converges uniformly on any compact subset of U
and, by Proposition 6.4, the limit function is again harmonic.

12.8

SUBHARMONIC FUNCTIONS

489

A useful variation of Harnack's theorem is:
Proposition 7.2. Let {Uk} be a sequence of harmonic functions defined on
an open set U and satisfying (7.2). Suppose that there is a constant M such
that Uk(X) < M for all k and all x E U. Then the sequence of functions
{Uk} converges uniformly on any compact subset of U to a harmonic
function.

To prove Proposition 7.2 we remark that this time the convergence of
{Uk(X)} at each x E U is automatic because it is a monotone (nondecreasing)
sequence of bounded real numbers. Proposition 7.1 guarantees that the convergence is uniform on compact subsets to a harmonic limit function.
8. SUBHARMONIC FUNCTIONS

In this section and the next we shall show that Dirichlet's problem can be solved
for bounded open sets U whose boundaries satisfy certain regularity conditions.
The proof that we shall present (there are many others) is due to Perron and
makes essential use of the concept of a subharmonic function. Let U be a function
defined on the open set U. We say that U is subharmonic if
a)

U

is continuous; and

b) for any connected open subset W of U and any harmonic function, v
defined on W, the function U - v satisfies the maximum principle on W.
In other words, for any such Wand v, if there is some Xo E W with

U(X) - v(x) :::; u(xo) - v(xo)
then u(x) - v(x)

= u(xo) -

for all

x E W,

v(xo) in W.

In order to understand condition (b) a little better, we study some of its
consequences. First of all, we can let v be the harmonic function that is identically zero. Then (b) says that U satisfies the maximum principle on every open
subset of U.
Next we let BR be some ball with center z whose closure is contained in U.
In particular, its boundary, SR, is contained in U, and the function U is continuous on SR. We can therefore find a harmonic function v defined on the open
ball and taking on the values u(y) for y E SR. We take W to be the open ball
and v to be the function we have just constructed. Then u - v vanishes on SR,
so (b) implies that u(x) :::; v(x) for all x E W. In particular, u(z) :::; v(z). But

In other words, a subharmonic function is always less than or equal to its average value over a sphere about a point. This property is frequently taken as the
definition of a function's being subharmonic, and the hypothesis of continuity is
somewhat relaxed. However, the definition we gave above is more suitable for
our present purposes.
Let WI and W2 be two subharmonic functions defined on an open set U.
Define the function WI V W2 by setting
(WI

V W2)(X)

=

max

[WI (X),

W2(X)],

The function WI V W2 is again subharmonic. The fact that WI V W2 is continuous is established as follows: Let x be any point of U. Then WI V W2(X) is
either WI(X) or W2(X), say WI(X). Since WI is continuous, for any E > 0, we can
find a 0 > 0 such that IWI(Y) - wI(x)1 < E for IY - xl < o. Similarly, we
can arrange to have W2(Y) < W2(X)
E for that same range of y, so that
W2(Y) < WI(X)
E, since WI(X) = max [WI(X), W2(X)].
For these values of Y
we thus have
WI(X) - E < WI(Y) :::; WI V W2(Y) < WI(X)
E,

+

+

+

so that WI V W2 is continuous. Now let W be a connected open subset of U
and let v be a harmonic function on W. Suppose that WI V W2 - v takes on
its maximum value at some point Xo of W. Suppose that WI V W2(XO) =
WI(XO)' Then for all x E W
WI(X) - v(x) :::;

WI

V W2(X) - v(X) :::; WI(XO) - v(xo).

Since WI is subharmonic, the right and left sides of this inequality must be equal.
Thus WI V W2 - v satisfies the maximum principle on W, which shows that
WI V W2 is subharmonic.
Let W be a subharmonic function defined on an open set U, and let B be a
ball whose closure is contained in U. Let u be the solution of Dirichlet's problem
for the ball B with boundary values w. Thus u is the unique function continuous
in the closed ball, harmonic in the open ball, and coinciding with W on the
boundary S of B. As we have already observed, w(x) :::; u(x) for x E B. Now
define the function W B by setting
WB(X)

=

{ W(X)
u(x)

for
for

x E U - B,
x E B.

We claim that the function WB is again subharmonic. The proof is just as before.
The continuity is obvious, as before. If W is subset of U and v is a harmonic
function on W, then WB - v cannot achieve a strict maximum at any interior
point: suppose WB(X) - v(x) :::; WB(XO) - v(xo) for all x E W. (See Fig. 12.9.)
If Xo E U - B, then we have w(x) - v(x) :::; WB(X) - v(x) :::; WB(XO) - v(xo) =
w(xo) - v(xo). Since W is subharmonic, all these inequalities must be equalities.
On the other hand, if Xo E B, then since WB is harmonic in the open ball, we must
have WB(X) - v(x) = WB(XO) - v(xo) for all x E W. By continuity, this implies

12.9

DIRICHLET'S PROBLEM

that WB(Y) - v(y) = WB(XO) - v(xo) for yEW n S. If W n S ;;t!= 0, we can
take y as a new Xo and the problem is reduced to the previous case.
In short, to every subharmonic function W defined on U we have attached
another subharmonic function WB such that WB is actually harmonic in the
interior of B and coincides with W in U - B, and such that W :::; WB throughout
U. It is clear from the method of construction that if WI and W2 are two subharmonic functions defined on U with WI :::; W2, then

following two conditions:
a) each W E Wj is subharmonic; and
b) for each p E au,

Note that the family of functions Wf is nonempty, since the constant function
which is identically -M clearly belongs to Wf. Also note that condition (b)
implies that lim sup w(x) < M as x --t aU. Since W E Wf is subharmonic, we
conclude from the maximum principle that Iwi < M for all W E Wf'
Now define the function Uf by setting
Uf{X) =

lub w(x).
wEW,

In view of the preceding remarks, the function Uf is well defined and, in fact,
lu(x)1 < M for all x E U. We shall show that if f is continuous on au, the
function Uf is the solution of the Dirichlet problem for U. We must thus show
that Uf is harmonic and takes on the boundary values f.
We first show, without any continuity restrictions onf, that Uf is harmonic.
To do this it is sufficient to show that uf is harmonic in any open ball B, where
13 c U. Let x be some point of B. Let WI, W2, •.• , Wk, ••• , be a sequence of

The function WiB belongs to W" since it is subharmonic and coincides with w~
near aU. Furthermore, since W ::; WB for any subharmonic function, we can
conclude that lim W:B(X) = Uf(X). Inside the ball B, each of the functions W:B
is harmonic, so that the sequence {W:B} is a monotone nondecreasing sequence
of harmonic functions in B. Since all the functions of Wf are bounded by M,
we conclude from Proposition 7.2 that the sequence {W:B} converges uniformly
on any compact subset of B to a function U which is harmonic in B, and we have
uf(X) = u(x). Furthermore, by definition, we have u(y) ::; Uf(Y) for any y E B.
We would like to show that we actually have u(y) = uf(Y) for all such y. To this
effect, we follow the same procedure at y, namely, we select a sequence {V:B}
where each V:B is harmonic in B, belongs to W" and is such that the sequence is
monotone nondecreasing and lim V:B(Y) = Uf(Y). In this way we obtain another
function v which is harmonic in B and satisfies v ::; Uf throughout B, and
v(y) = Uf(Y). Finally, let the functions 8i be defined by

and consider the functions SiB. On the one hand, they all belong to W, and are
harmonic in B. Furthermore, we have W:B :::; SiB and ViB :::; $iB. Finally, the
sequence {SiB} is nondecreasing and therefnre converges to a harmonic function
8 in B. By construction, we have

throughout B, while u(x) = 8(X) = uAx) and u(y) = 8(y) = u,(y). Applying
the maximum principle to the harmonic functions u - 8 and v - 8, we conclude
(since the maximum value 0 is achieved at x and y, respectively) that S =
u = v in all of B. We thus see that u,(y) = u(y) for any y E B, which shows
that

Now the function b is continuous and vanishes at p. Thus by choosing x
sufficiently close to p we can arrange that the right-hand side of (9.3) is less than
2E. Thus Uf(X) -+ f(p) as x -+ p.
In particular, if all points of au are touchable, and if f is continuous at all
points of the boundary, we have proved:
Theorem 9.1. Let U be an open subset of P with compact closure and
touchable boundary. Let f be a continuous function defined on au. Then
there exists a unique function Uj which is continuous on V and harmonic
in U, and which coincides with f on aU.
Some remarks concerning Theorem 9.1 and its proof are in order.
a) The only time we used the assumption that aU is touchable was when
we constructed a function b which was subharmonic in V, vanished at p, and took
on values less than some negative constant on all points of au outside some
neighborhood of p. Now a more careful analysis will show that we can always
construct such a function so long as we can touch p from the outside by a cone.
Thus we can solve the Dirichlet problem even at points like the p in Fig. 12.12.

Fig. 12.12

b) On the other hand, some condition on the boundary is necessary. For
instance, if aU contains an isolated point p, then we cannot assign the value at p
arbitrarily. In fact, if U is continuous in a neighborhood W of p and harmonic in
W - {p}, then the Poisson integral formula implies that the various derivatives
of U will also be bounded in W - {p}. Therefore, the proof of the mean-value
theorem applies to the point p itself, and so u(p) is determined and cannot be
assigned arbitrarily. More generally, a more delicate argument shows that
the Dirichlet problem cannot be solved for domains whose boundaries contain spikes pointing inward or (in dim ~3) sufficiently sharp cusps (as in

12.10

sharp conductor cannot hold a charge, but will spark. (The relation with
electrostatics will be discussed in Section 12.)
c) For the purpose of applying the results of Section 4, i.e., the construction
of the Green function of the domain and the various identities, Theorem 9.1
is still not quite enough. We need to know not only that the Green function
exists, but also that it has continuous derivatives up to the boundary. This fact
requires further argument and additional assumptions about the nature of the
boundary; it will be discussed in the next section.

The purpose of this section is to discuss the behavior of the solution of the
Dirichlet problem near the boundary. In fact, we shall prove:
Theorem 10.1. Let U be a domain with regular boundary and compact
closure in lEn. Let f be a continuously differentiable function defined on au,
and let u be the solution of the Dirichlet problem with boundary values f.
Then the partial derivatives auf axi can be extended to continuous functions

Proof. Let p be some point of au, and let us arrange, by a Euclidean motion,
that the tangent plane to au at p is the plane xn = O. (See Fig. 12.14.) Then
near p the points of aU are all points of the form (Xl, ... , xn-I, cp(xI, ... , X n - l )),

Now let us replace the function f by f - [f(p)

Then u - (f(p)
L~-l (af/axi)(p)xij is the solution of the corresponding
Dirichlet problem. In this way we may assume (changing our notation accordingly) that f, together with its first derivatives, vanishes at p. Since f is assumed
to have continuous first derivatives, we may apply Taylor's theorem to conclude
that there exists a c > such that for all q on au sufficiently close to p we have

Since the function b is harmonic in U, the maximum principle applied to u - Ab

Now the function b is a differentiable function of the distance from z which
vanishes when this distance is R. In particular, there is a constant a > 0

point p. (See Fig. 12.16.) Thus for points y on S, d(y) :$ cillY - p1l2. If we

Since the sphere is (n - l)-dimensional, this last integral converges absolutely,
and we thus see that the first integral in (10.6) is uniformly absolutely convergent. (Note that the term containing this integral vanishes if i < n.) We now
show that the second term in (10.6) tends to zero as xn tends to zero. In fact,
R2 - /Ix + zl/2 = xn(2R - x n), so we can write the second term of (10.6) as

(2R - xn) (xn) 1/2 I (xn) 1/2U(Y) (Xi _ yi)
A n- 1R
I/x - yl/n+2

This time, since xn ~ I/x - yl/ for all YES, we can assert that the integrand

I/y - xl/n+3/2 - I/y - xl/n+l/2 - I/y - pl/n+l/2 ,
which is again absolutely integrable. Therefore, the integral occurring in the
last expression is uniformly bounded for all values of xn ~ o. Since (xn) 1/2 --7 0,
we conclude that the second term of (10.6) approaches zero.
If we now rephrase the result we have obtained independently of the
special choice of coordinates, we see that we have proved the following: Let p
be any point of au, and let x be a point on the normal line to au through p.
If ~ is any vector parallel to a tangent vector at p, then (~, du) --7 (~, df) as
x --7 p along the normal line. If a/an denotes the unit vector in the normal

where the integral is taken over the sphere of radius R tangent to au at p and
lying inside U.
SO far, we have proved convergence only if x --7 p along the normal direction.
If we go back and examine the argument, we see that the radius R and the
constant D in (10.5) can be chosen uniformly for all p E au. (In fact, since aU
is compact, we can cover au by a finite number of neighborhoods, of type (iii),
such that a ball of radius R about each p E aU lies in one of these neighborhoods,
where R is sufficiently small. In such a situation it is clear that the choice of R
(still smaller, if necessary) depends only on the second derivatives of the change
of charts from Euclidean coordinates to the adjusted charts. Also the choice
of D depends only on the constants involved in the Taylor expansion of f and
on R. Thus the choice of Rand D can be made uniformly.) Since, byassump-

12.11

tion, the partial derivatives of f are continuous and the right-hand side of (10.7)
is continuous in p, we conclude that the limits of the partial derivatives of u
exist as we approach the boundary in any direction, and that in fact we have
proved Theorem 10.1. 0
We can now construct a Green function for any domain with regular
boundary by the solution of Dirichlet's problem, as in Section 4. Theorem 10.1
tells us that it is differentiable in the closed set V in the sense that the partial
derivatives are continuous up to the boundary. If we want to derive the various
formulas of Section 4, we can do so by applying a limit argument: We simply
replace V by a smaller domain va such that va ~ V and aVa ~ av as a ~ o.
(Actually, a more careful and delicate argument will show that if f has two
continuous derivatives, then the auj axi we obtain as limits on the boundary are
in fact continuously differentiable. Since aujax i is the solution of the Dirichlet
problem with these boundary values, we conclude that the second derivatives
of u can be extended so as to be continuous on V. In this way one can prove that
if f is C~, all the derivatives of u can be extended so as to be continuous on V.
In particular, all the derivatives of the Green function G(x, .) can be extended
to continuous functions at the boundary for any x E V.)
11. DIRICHLET'S PRINCIPLE

The solution of Dirichlet's problem has an interesting and useful characterization as the solution of the problem of minimizing the Dirichlet integral
D[u, u] = J'L (aujax i )2 with given boundary values. More precisely,
Let V be a domain with compact
closure and regular boundary, and let f be a continuously differentiable
function on aV. Let u be the solution of the Dirichlet problem with
boundary values f, and let w be any function which is differentiable in V
and takes on the values of f on the boundary, and whose derivatives can
be extended to be continuous in V. Then
Theorem 11.1 (Dirichlet's principle).

D[u, u] ::; D[w, w],

and equality holds if and only if u = w.

V, continuous on V, and vanishing on av. Then

Proof. Let us write w

D[w, w] = D[u

+ v, u + v] =

D[u, u]

+ D[v, v] + 2D[u, v],

(11.2)

since D is bilinear and symmetric in its arguments.
Now suppose for the moment that u possesses two continuous derivatives
and v possesses one continuous derivative in a neighborhood of V. Then

Now D[v, v] = J'L. (av/ax i )2 ~ 0 and vanishes if and only if all the derivatives
of v vanish, so that v is a constant on each component of U. Since v vanishes on
au, we conclude that D[v, v] = 0 if and only if v = O.
In case u and v are not necessarily differentiable in a neighborhood of au,
we establish that D[u, v] = 0 by writing

Du[u, v] = lim Dua[u, v],
where Ua is a sequence of domains which approach U as a ~ 0 and aU a ~ au.
Applying the previous argument to each of the domains U a , we conclude that
D[u, v] = 0 and D[v, v] = 0 if and only if v = O. This proves the theorem. 0
12. PHYSICAL APPLICATIONS

The study of Laplace's equation and its solutions plays an important role in
many theories of classical physics. This is essentially due to the intimate
connection between the Laplace operator and Euclidean geometry. Since this
is not the place to elaborate on the physical applications, we refer the reader to
any physics text for the details. (See, for instance, Feynman, Leighton, and
Sands, The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Addison-Wesley, Reading, Mass.,
1964, vol. II, especially Chapter 12.) We shall briefly mention some of the
relevant physics in this section.
In electrostatics it is assumed that the electric field E satisfies the equations
d

*E

=

p,

dE= 0,

where p is the density of charge and we identify the vector field E with a linear
differential form via the Euclidean metric on 1E3. Here p is assumed, for the
moment, to be a smooth density. (It is also convenient to consider the limiting
cases of "surface distributions" and "point distributions".) By the second of
these equations, we know that E can be written as
E =

-dcp,

where cp is a smooth function known as the potential of the electric field. The
first equation then implies that
Acp = d

H p is given, then cp is determined by the formula

where l ds is a linear distribution along a curve C.
For a point charge located at x, we obtain

Fig. 12.17

where e is the magnitude of the charge.
There can be no electric field along a conductor (since this would result in a
motion of the charge, which contradicts the assumption of a static field). Thus
and

IP

= const.

In most problems that arise the distribution of charge is not known in
advance, but must be determined. For example, suppose that a unit charge is
placed at a point x inside a cavity whose boundary is a conductor which is
grounded, i.e., kept at zero potential. (See Fig. 12.17.) We want to find the
electric field inside the cavity. There will be a charge distribution induced on
the boundary surface that we also wish to determine. Since there is no charge
distribution anywhere inside the cavity, except at x, the potential IP must be
harmonic everywhere except at x, and, in fact, differs from
1

by a harmonic function. Since we want IP = 0 on the boundary, we see that the
desired potential IP is exactly the Green function for the domain. The surface
density can then be determined from dIP along the boundary. (This is another
reason why it is important to know that the solution of Dirichlet's problem is
differentiable at the boundary.)
More frequently, we are interested in the electric field outside conducting
surfaces. Here, strictly speaking, the theory we have developed of Dirichlet's
problem does not apply, since we considered only bounded domains. We can
handle this problem in one of two ways. First, we can reduce to the Dirichlet
problem by considering everything contained inside a very large conducting
sphere (at potential zero). Then we let the radius go to infinity to get the
desired potential as a limit. Second, we can modify our arguments in SeCtions 3
through 10 to include the case of unbounded domains, but restrict all our functions to vanishing as clr at infinity. The details are left to the reader.
In the theory of diffusion one assumes that material of some nature is
flowing according to a vector field X. If the density of the material is p dV,

502

POTENTIAL THEORY IN

lEn

12.12

then the amount of material flowing per unit time through an oriented piece of
surface S is given by

Is

p(X, n) dA =

Is

*pX,

where n is the unit normal vector to the surface, dA is the element of area, and,
we are regarding pX on the right-hand side as a linear differential form via the
Euclidean metric. Thus the net amount of material flowing out of any region is
d * pX = div -< X, p>-. Now "material" may be produced in the region at a rate
s dV (where s is the function describing the rate of productivity of the sources
in the region). Thus the total change of density is given by

~~ dV =

div -<X, p>- - s dV.

If, as we shall assume, the situation is stationary, i.e., the density does not
change, we obtain the equations
div -<X, p>-

=

s dV.

On the other hand, it frequently happens that the flow is given by the gradient
of some function, i.e.,
PidX = dN
for some function N. Combining these equations, we obtain

I1N

=

s.

In the theory of heat N is the temperature, PidX is the rate of flow of heat, and
s is the density of the sources of heat. The equation PidX = dN says that the
rate of flow of heat is proportional to the gradient of temperature. In the theory
of diffusion of particles it is assumed that the rate of flow of the material is
proportional to the change (i.e., gradient) of the density of the particles. (This
says that the particles tend to flow from a region of higher density to a region
of lower density.) Then N represents the density of the particles and s represents
the rate of production of particles.
Suppose, for example, that the boundary of a region D is kept at some fixed
temperature j, where j is a given function on aD and there are no sources of heat
inside D. Then the distribution of temperature in D is given by the function N
which satisfies the differential equation I1N = 0 and the boundary condition
N = j on aD. In other words, the temperature is determined by the solution
of Dirichlet's problem.
In the theory of steaily, incompressible, il'rotational flow of a fluid it is assumedthat a vector field X is given which represents the flow of the liquid. By the
incompressibility it follows that d * X = O. It is assumed that there is no
circulation, that is, dX = O. Thus X = dcp for some function cp which is a
solution of Laplace's equations. The natural boundary-value problems that arise
in this case are different from those we have been discussing, so we simply refer
the reader to standard works on fluid mechanics.

CLASSICAL MECHANICS

In this chapter we shall present a brief introduction to the study of classical
theoretical mechanics. We emphasize that what we are studying is a branch
of mathematics-idealized from the mathematical considerations common to
many problems arising in the physics of mechanical systems. We will thus
formulate, on an axiomatic basis, a mathematical model that describes features
that arise in the study of the equations of mechanics. The model will apply to
most situations arising in the mechanical applications. In order to simplify the
mathematics, we have sacrificed a certain amount of generality, and therefore
there will be some situations in classical mechanics where our model is inadequate.
Mechanics is devoted to the study of how a physical system evolves in time.
The first fundamental assumption is that the system can be described (locally)
by a collection of continuous parameters. More precisely, we assume that the
set of all possible "positions" or configurations of the physical system is a
differentiable manifold M which is called the configuration space.
For example, if the physical system consists of three particles free to move
in space, we can describe the "position" of the system at any given instant by
giving the positions of each of the three particles. Thus, in this case, the configuration space is
1E3 X 1E3 X 1E 3.
H we insist that no two particles be able to occupy the same position of space at
the same time, then the configuration space M is given by

M = 1E3 X 1E3 X 1E3 - S,
where

s=

{-<Vb V2, V3

>- : Vi

E

1E3 and

VI

=

V2

or VI

=

V3

or V2

=

V3}.

If the physical system is a rigid body (say a top) spinning about some point
held fixed in space, then the position of the system is completely described by
giving the position in space of three orthonormal vectors on the body (drawn
through the fixed point, say). Since these vectors can be placed in any position
but must remain orthonormal and cannot change orientation (from right- to
left-handedness), we see that M is the set of all oriented orthonormal bases of 1E 3 •
In this case M is a three-dimensional manifold. If we fix some arbitrary initial
orthonormal basis -< eb e2, e3>-, then any possible position of the system is
509

510

CLASSICAL MECHANICS

given by -< VI, V2, V3 >-, where Vi = Aei and A is a rotation, that is, A is an
orthogonal linear transformation with positive determinant. Thus M is diffeomorphic to 0+(3), the space of all orthogonal three-by-three matrices with
positive determinant.
The basic problem of mechanics is to describe how the configuration of the
system changes in time. As the system evolves, the configuration at any instant
t will be given by some point G(t) EM. Our problem is to give a reasonably
simple description of the possible curves G which can arise as actual changes
in the configuration of the mechanical system.
The second fundamental assumption of classical mechanics is that the
curve G(t) can be determined from a knowledge of the "state" of the system
at any given time. That is, we may (and, in general, will) have to know more
about the system at a given time than its configuration in order to be able to
predict its future configuration. However, if we do have enough such instantaneous information, we can determine the curve G(t). The total amount of
relevant information is called the state of the system. It is assumed that the set
of all states is itself a differentiable manifold, S. Since the state of a system contains more information than the configuration, we can assign to every state s the
configuration 1I'(s) EM of the system in the state s. In other words, we have a
map 11': S -- M. We assume that this map 11' is differentiable.
It is assumed that if we know the state s of the system at time to, we can
predict its state at any future time t. Thus we are given a map
'Pt,to: S -- S

such that if the system is in the state s at time to, it will be in the state 'Pt,to(s)
at time t. Now there is nothing special about the time to. If t > tl > to and s
is the state at time to, then 'Ptl,tO(S) is the state at time h, and therefore
'Pt,tl ('Ptl,tO(S»

is the state at time t.
In other words,
Now it turns out that in most (basic) mechanical systems, if the time is suitably
parametrized, the function 'Pt,to really depends only on t - to. (This fails to
hold in the so-called nonconservative systems. A typical nonconservative
system is one involving friction. This is usually a consequence of not studying
a sufficiently complete system. In the case of friction, for example, the heat loss
must be taken into account.) Let us assume that 'Pt,to depends only on t - to.
Then, if we write
and
then the previous equation can be written as

13.1

THE TANGENT AND COTANGENT BUNDLES

511

This looks like the defining relation for a one-parameter group except that so
far we have been restricting ourselves to nonnegative values of 8. In point of
fact, it is assumed that this restriction is unnecessary and, in fact, we are given
a flow ep on S.
To repeat, we are given a differentiable manifold M representing the set of
all possible configurations of our system, a differentiable manifold S representing
all possible states of the system, a differentiable map 1r: S ~ M, and a flow ep on
S. Then the curves C(t) are all assumed to be of the form
C(t)

=

1rep/(x)

for some

xES.

We must therefore describe S, 1r, and ep for any given configuration space M.
Classical mechanics makes a very definite assumption about the nature of the
space S (and the map 1r). It asserts that the state of a system is completely
determined by its (configuration and its) "momentum". What is the momentum
of our abstract setup? As usual, the momentum should be something that resists
change in velocity. It turns out that an appropriate object representing "infinitesimal resistance to change in istantaneous velocity" is a cotangent vector. A
heuristic motivation for this, which the reader may choose to ignore, is the following: At any given configuration x EM, the set of all possible velocity vectors
is just TAM). At any given v E Tx(M), a "resistance to change in v" would be
some function defined near v and vanishing at v. To first order we could replace
such a function by its differential. Thus "infinitesimal resistance" is a linear
function on Tv(Tx(M). Since Tx(M) is a vector space, we may identify
Tv(Tx(M) with TxCM) for each v. Thus all possible "momenta" become identified with all elements of T:(M).
The set S is thus taken to be the set of all momenta, i.e., the set of all
cotangent vectors at all points of M. We must first show how to make this
space into a differentiable manifold.
1. THE TANGENT AND COTANGENT BUNDLES

Let M be a differentiable manifold, and let us consider the set T(M) of all
tangent vectors to all points of M. Thus
T(M)

= U

Tx(M).

xEM

Let 1r denote the map of T(M) onto M which assigns to each tangent vector the
point of M at which it is defined; that is, if ~ E Tx(M), then 1r(~) = x. We
claim that T(M) can be made into a differentiable manifold in a natural way,
so that 1r is a differentiable map. In fact, let a be an atlas on M. For any
(U, a) E a, define T(a): 1r- 1 (U) ~ V E9 V by setting
T(aH

= -< a(x),

~a

>-

if

~ E

Tx(M), x E U.

(1.1)

We claim that the collection (1r- 1 U, T(a) is an atlas on T(M). To check that

512

13.1

CLASSICAL MECHANICS

T(a) is one-to-one, we observe that if ~ E T",(M) and 'T/ E TII(M) with x ~ y,
then a(x) ~ a(y); while if ~ ~ 'T/ and both lie in T",(M), we have ta ~ 'T/a.
To check that the transition law is satisfied, we note that Eq. (4.3), Chapter 9
implies that if (U, a) and (W, (3) are two charts of ct,
T({3)

=

T(a)-l(v, ~a)

(1.2)

for <v, ~a>- E T(a)7r- l (U n W), that is, v E a(U n W) and ~a arbitrary
in V.
The fact that the structure on T(M) does not depend on the choice of (j,
is obvious. That 7r is differentiable is also clear; in fact, (7r- l (U), T(a)) and
(U, a) are compatible charts in terms of which a 0 7r 0 T(a)-l(v, ~a) = v. We
call T(M), together with its structure as a differentiable manifold, the tangent
bundle of M.
If M is finite-dimensional, let (U, a) be a chart of M with coordinates
xl, ... , xn, so that
a(x)

=

<xl(x), ... , xn(x) >- E IRn.

We will denote the coordinates associated to the chart T(a) on 7r- l (U) by
<ql, ... , qn, qt, ... , ct>-. Hence if ~ E T",(M), where x E U, we have
T(a)(~)

=

<a(x), ~a><ql(~),

... , qn(~), ql(~), ... , qnw >-,

so that
qi

(1.3)

and

In other words, the qi are just the coordinates Xi regarded as functions on T(M)
via 7r, and the qi(~) are the components of ~ relative to the basis

{(a~i).,' ... ,(a:

n)

J.

We can follow a similar procedure for
T*(M)

= U

T:(M),

",EM

which we call the cotangent bundle. If (U, a) is a chart of an atlas
define the map

(j,

of M,

by setting
T*(a) (l) =

<a(x), la >-

(1.4)

for l E T:(M) and x E U. As before, this defines an atlas on T*(M) which,
in turn, defines a differentiable structure on T*(M) which is independent of the
choice of atlas of M. (Note that we have used the same letter, 7r, to denote the
two projections: that of T(M) ~ M and that of T*(M) ~ M. Whenever there
is any confusion, we shall denote these maps by 7rT and 7rT*.)

13.2

EQUATIONS OF VARIATION

If M is finite-dimensional and (U, a) is a chart on the coordinates Xl,
we shall denote the coordinates of (n·-l(U), T*(a)) by

••• ,

xn,

-<ql, ... , qn, pI, ... , pn>-.

Thus, if l E T:(M), where x E U, we have
T*(a)l =
=

-< a(x), la >-<ql(l), ... , qn(l), pl(l), ... ,pn(l) >-,

so that

(1.5)

2. EQUATIONS OF VARIATION

Let M 1 and M 2 be two differentiable !nanifolds, and let cp: M 1 ~ M 2 be a differentiable !nap. Then cp induces a map T(cp) of T(M 1) ~ T(M 2) when we set

(2.1)
To check that T(cp) is differentiable, let us choose compatible charts (U, a) on
M 1 and (W, (3) on M 2. Then it follows from the definition of T(cp) that
and

(T(U), T(a))

(T(W), T({3))

are compatible charts. Furthermore,

(2.2)

This establishes that T(cp) is differentiable. Observe that if l/;: M 2 ~ M 3 is a
second differentiable map, then it follows from Eq. (4.4) of Chapter 9 that
T(l/;

cp) = T(l/;)

T(cp).

(2.3)

Furthermore, it is clear from the definition that

(2.4)

In other words, the diagram

• M2

commutes in the sense that it doesn't matter which path one takes to get from
T(M l ) to M 2.
In particular, if {CPI} is a one-parameter group of diffeomorphisms of M, we
get a one-parameter group T(CPI) on T(M), where, by (2.4),

CLASSICAL MECHANICS

If X is the infinitesimal generator of {cpt}, let us denote by T(X) the infinitesimal generator of {T(cpt)}. It follows from (2.5) that if ~ E Tx(M), then

(2.6)
Let us obtain the expression for T(X) in terms of a chart: Let (U, a) be a
chart, and choose an open set W such that W C U and E > 0 such that CPt (W)C U

so that, differentiating with respect to tat t = 0, we see by Eq. (4.9) of Chapter 9
that
(2.7)
If M is finite-dimensional,

Xa

xn are the coordinates of (U, a), and

Xl, ••• ,

-<XI, ... , xn>-,

then we can rewrite (2.7) as

T(X)r(a)-<v, W>- =

~XI(V)' ... ' Xn(v), L aa~; wi, ... , L aa~; wi~,

where w = -< WI, .•• , w n >-. In other words, in terms of the local coordinates

take the form

(jj=
q, ... ,q

(2.8)

and
(2.9)
Note that Eqs. (2.8) are just the local equations corresponding to the vector field
X. Since qi = xi 0 7r, this is simply another way of writing (2.6). Suppose that

CPt(x) = -<xl(t), ... , xn(t) >is a solution curve of X lying in U. Then we can regard the coefficients

the equation of variation of X along the curve cp(x). Roughly speaking, it repre-

sents, to linear approximation, how solution curves of X near cp(x) are deviating
from cp(x).
We now go through a similar construction for the cotangent bundle. If
cp: M 1 ~ M 2 is a differentiable map, then CP:: T;(x)(M 2) ~ T:(M 1) is going in
the wrong direction. We therefore restrict our attention to maps which are
locally diffeomorphisms, and we define T*(cp) by setting
T*(cp)l

=

=

(cp-1)*l

if

(cp;(x»)-ll

l E T:(M 1).

(2.10)

Since cp is a diffeomorphism,
(cp *)-1: T:(M 1) ~ T;(x)(M 2)

is well defined, and we have
7r

T*(cp) = cp

If (U, a) and (W, (3) are compatible charts on M 1 and M 2, then

so that

In particular, if {cpt} is a flow on a manifold M, we obtain a flow T*(cpt)
on T*(M). It satisfies

If X is the infinitesimal generator of {cpt}, we denote by T*(X) the infinitesimal
generator of {T*(cpt)}. It satisfies

(2.15)

3. THE FUNDAMENTAL LINEAR DIFFERENTIAL FORM ON T*(M)

Before returning to our study of mechanics, we study in some detail the geometry
of the cotangent bundle. Let M be a differentiable manifold, and let z be a point
of T*(M). Let ~ be a tangent vector to T*(M) at the point z, so that
~ E Tz(T*(M)).

Then 7r*~ is an element of Tr(z)(M). Since z E
T r(z)(M), we can consider the expression

T~(z)(M)

is a linear function on

(7r*~, z)

which depends linearly on

~.

We denote this linear function of ~ by 8z • We have

516

13.3

CLASSICAL MECHANICS

thus defined a linear differential form 8 on T*(M) by setting
(3.1)
The form 8 is called the fundamental linear form of T*(M). Let us obtain the
expression for 8 in terms of a chart (-71·- 1(U), T*(a). Since T*(a) maps '7I'"-l(U)
onto an open set, 0 of V ED V*, the expression 8T*(a) should be a function from
o to (V ED V*)* which can be identified with V* ED V. Let us evaluate this
function. In terms of the chart (U, a) on M and ('7I'"-l(U), T*(a) on T*(M),
we have
h*(a) =

-<v, w*> E

V

and

ED V*

so that
('71'"*~,

z) = (v, za) .

. Thus ( -< v, w* >, (8 zh*(a» = (v, Za); that is,
(8 zh*(a)

= -<Za, 0>

E V* ED V

= (V ED V*)*.

In other words, the local expression 8a for the differential form 8 in terms of
the chart T*(a) is given by
(3.2)

If M is finite-dimensional and we use the local coordinates
pi, ... ,pn>, then

-< q 1, ••. , qn,

Thus

so that

(3.3)
Of course, (3.3) is just a way of writing (3.2) in terms of a basis of V = IRn.
Let cp: M 1 ~ M 2 be a diffeomorphism, let 81 be the fundamental linear form
on T*(M 1), and let 82 be the fundamental linear form on T*(M 2). Let

Then
and so

T*(cp)z)

= (CP*20'II" *~, (cp*);C~)z)
= ('II" *~, z)
= (~, Biz).

In other words,
(3.4)

In particular, if {cpt} is a flow on M, then
(T*(cpt»)*B = B.
If X is a vector field on M, then the infinitesimal version of the last equation is

DT*(x)B

= o.

(3.5)

Note that any vector field X on M defines a functionfx on T*(M) by
fx(z)

= (X20' z)

if 'II"(z)

= x.

(3.6)

We also have
fx = (T*(X), B},

(3.7)

since (T*(X)z, Bz) = ('II"*T*(X)z, z) = (X20' z) by (2.15).
Finally, in view of (3.5) and Eq. (6.14), Chapter 11, we have

o=

DT*(x)B

= d(T*(X), B) + T*(X)

...J dB,

so that

For reasons which will become clear later on, the function fx is sometimes called
the momentum function associated to the vector field X.
4. THE FUNDAMENTAL EXTERIOR TWO-FORM ON T*(M)

It turns out that the exterior two-form
D

= dB

(4.1)

plays a fundamental role in mechanics, and we therefore study some of its
properties. First of all, since d 2 = 0, we have
dD=

o.

(4.2)

We claim that Dz is'a nonsingular bilinear form on Tz(T*(M») for each
z E T*(M). That is,
if

CLASSICAL MECHANICS

For this purpose we compute the local expression for n in terms of a chart
(U), T*(a) [where Z E 7r- I (U)]. The map T*(a) gives a diffeomorphism
of 7r- I (U) with a subset of V E9 V*, and by (3.4) the form (J on M carries over
to the corresponding form (Ja on V E9 V* = T*(V). Also, (Ja can be regarded as
a (V* E9 V)-valued function which is given by (3.2). Let us denote h*(a) by ~a,
and let
~a = -<Xl> X 2 > E V E9 V*
(7r- I

be considered a constant vector field on V E9 V*. Then
(~a, (Ja)<u!.u;>

and so

d(~a,

(X I,

u;),

(Ja) is the linear differential form given by

On the other hand, since ~a is a constant vector field, the Lie derivative DEa(Ja
reduces to the ordinary derivative of the linear function -< U2,
> ~ -<
0> .
This derivative is just the constant -<X 2 , 0>. Thus the Lie derivative DEa(Ja
is given by the constant linear form

D~a(Ja

-<X 2 ,0> E V* E9 V;

that is,
(Tla, DEa(Ja) = (Y l> X 2).

Now ~a..J na = ~a..J d(Ja = DEa(Ja - d(~a, (Ja), so we see that ~a..J na is the
constant form
~a..J (lfJ = -<X 2 ,-X 1 > E V* E9 V.
To recapitulate, if ~ E Tz(T*(M)

(4.4)

Equation (4.3) clearly follows from this.
Since (4.3) is of fundamental importance, we present an alternative derivation for the case of a finite-dimensional manifold. If we use the coordinates

have a one-to-one correspondence, X ~ X ..J n, between vector fields and

so that

519

Let us denote by Wx the form corresponding to X,

Wx = X ..In;
and let us denote by X w the vector field corresponding to the linear differential
form w. Thus
w = Xw ..J n = Wx.,.
Observe that
if and only if
dw= 0
Dx.,n = O.
(4.7)
In fact, by (4.2),

Dx.,n = d(Xw..J n) = dw.
In particular, there is a distinguished class of ve~tor fields on T*(M)-those
corresponding to functions, i.e., the vector fields of the form X dF , where F is a
function on T*(M). These vector fields are called Hamiltonian vector fields.
*In view of (4.6), if Dxn = 0, then locally, at least, X is of the form XdF,
since any form w with dw = 0 can be written locally as w = dF. If we make the
topological assumption that T*(M) has vanishing first cohomology group, then
Dxn = 0 is equivalent to X being Hamiltonian. This assumption is really a
restriction on the nature of the configuration space M. Since we do not wish to
restrict M in this manner, we will not take Dxn = 0 as the definition of a
Hamiltonian vector field.*
Note that if X and Yare Hamiltonian vector fields, so is aX
and b are constants. In fact, if X = X dF and Y = XdG, then

aX

+ bY =

+ bY, where a

Xd(aF+bG)'

Furthermore, [X, Y] is also a Hamiltonian vector field. In fact,

Dx(Y..J n) = Dx Y ..J n
= DxY..Jn,

+ Y ..J Dxn

since Dxn = O. Since Dx Y = [X, Y], we see that

[X, Y] ..J n = Dx dG

= dDxG.

In other words, we have
(4.8)
We thus see that we have a binary operation on functions corresponding to the
Lie bracket on Hamiltonian vector fields. It is called the Poisson b1'acket and is
denoted by {F, G}. In other words, we define
(4.9)

so that we can rewrite (4.8) as

then
In other words, if G is constant along the solution curves of X dF , then F is
constant along the solution curves of X dG .
In fact,

XdFG = {F, G} = -{G, F} = -XdGF.
It will turn out that Proposition 4.1 is the prototype of all the "conservation
laws" of mechanics.
We close this section with the following observation. Let Y be a vector
field on M. Then the momentum function of Y is a function jy on T*(M).
Equation (3.8) asserts that
(4.14)
-T*(Y) = X dfy '
5. HAMILTONIAN MECHANICS

As we indicated in the introduction, the first fundamental assumption of mechanics is that the evolution of the system is determined by a flow on T*(M),
where M is the configuration space of the system. The second fundamental
assumption concerns the character of the flow. It is assumed that the infinitesimal generator of the flow is a Hamiltonian vector field. That is, it is assumed
that there is a function H (called the energy) on T*(M) such that the vector
field X-dH is the infinitesimal generator of the flow on T*(M) describing the

13.5

HAMILTONIAN MECHANICS

521

evolution of the system. (The minus sign is a consequence of certain standard
conventions.) In order to see what this means, let us express the equations of
motion in terms of q- and p-coordinates for a finite-dimensional system. Thus
X -dH =

oH 0

L: ( opi oqi -

oH 0)

oqi opi .

Thus, if -<ql(-), . .. , qn(.), pl(-), ... , pn(-)>- is an integral curve of the flow,
it must satisfy the differential equations
dqi

oH

de

opi

and

(5.1)

A trivial consequence of (4.11) is that
X_dHH

= O.

In other words, the function H is constant along trajectories of the system.
This principle is known as the law of conservation of energy.
More generally, we can formulate Proposition 4.1 as:
Proposition 5.1. Let X -dH be the infinitesimal generator of a mechanical
system with energy H. Let F be a function such that
XdFH

= O.

Then F is constant on the trajectories, i.e., solution curves, of the flow
generated by X-dH.
Proposition 5.1 is the prototype of all the "momentum conservation" laws
we shall derive later; see, for example, the discussion at the beginning of Section 6.
In order to specify the mechanical system, one must give the function H.
It turns out (in many but not all cases) that the energy is the sum of two terms,
H = K
U, where K is called the kinetic energy and U is called the potential
energy. They each have a very special form which we now describe.
The kinetic energy is a function on T*(M) which is associated with a
Riemann metric on M. Let ( , ) be a Riemann metric on M. It gives a scalar
product ( , )x on each Tx(M), and therefore induces an isomorphism of TiM)
with T:(M), and thus gives a scalar product on T:(M) which we will continue
to denote by ( , ). The function K is then defined by

+

K(l)

=

tel, l).

(5.2)

To understand the relevance of a Riemann metric to mechanics, let us consider the
most elementary case - the study of a single particle of mass m in lEa. The usual relation
between velocity and momentum,

p=mq
can be formulated as follows: Consider the Riemann metric on 1E3 which is
m X the Euclidean metric. That is, if -< x, y, z>- are rectangular coordinates on

522

13.5

CLASSICAL MECHANICS

1E3 and
then

-< qx, qy, qZ1 qx, qy, qz>-

are the corresponding coordinates on T(1E3),

where
(5.3)

and
(5.4)
Thus the passage from velocity to momentum depends on the choice of a
Riemann metric, which determines a map from T(JJ1) --> T*(JJ1). This can be
regarded as a generalized "choice of mass" for the configuration.
The function U is assumed to be of the form U = U 0 7[", where U is a
function on JJ1. The form F = - dU is called the force field whose potential is U.
I t can be regarded as a vector field on JJ1 in view of the Riemann metric on JJ1:
for any

~ E

Tx(JJ1).

In the special case of a single particle in 1E3 with mass m, substituting (5.3)
and (5.4) into Eq. (5.1) gives, when we write H = K
U,

+

dpi = Fi
dt

and

(5.5)

or, since m is constant,
(5.6)

which is the usual rule stating that force = mass X acceleration.
Returning to the general theory, we now formulate a useful corollary of
Proposition 5.1.

+

Proposition 5.2. Let H = K
U be the energy associated with the
Riemann metric ( , ) and the function U on JJ1. Let Y be a vector field on
JJ1 which is an infinitesimal isometry of ( , ) and is such that YU = o.
Then the momentum function jy is constant under the flow generated
by X_ dH •

Let {<pt} be the flow generated by Y. Since <Pt is a local isometry, (<pil, <pil)

6. THE CENTRAL.FORCE PROBLEM

Before proceeding with the general theory, we illustrate the previous results in
a simple but important case. We will study the motion of a particle in 1E3 acted
on by a "force centered at the origin". That is, our configuration space M will
be taken to be 1E3 - {O}, and the Riemann metric is m X the Euclidean metric,
where m is the "mass" of the particle. We also assume that the function D
depends only on the distance to the origin. Thus D(x, y, z) = P(r), where
r2 = x 2
y2
Z2.
Under these circumstances it is clear that any rotation
about the origin is an isometry of the Riemann metric and preserves D. We
can therefore apply Proposition 5.2 to the infinitesimal rotations x(al ay) y(alax) to conclude that the corresponding momentum function XPy - yp", is
constant. (This momentum function is known as the angular momentum about
the z-axis.) Similarly, the functions Xpz - zp", and YPz - Zpy must be constant
on any trajectory of the flow. If we write x = -< x, y, z>- and p = -< p"" Py, pz>- ,
then these three conservation laws can be combined to read

+ +

x A p

= const,

(6.1)

which is known as the law of conservation of angular momentum. Here x and p
are considered vector-valued functions on T*(M). In order to study the implications of (6.1), let us first distinguish two cases: where the constant rE 0 and
where the constant vanishes. If the constant occurring in (6.1) does not vanish,
then (6.1) implies that the plane spanned by x and p does not change. In
particular, the motion is such that x lies in a fixed plane. If x A p = 0, we
argue as follows:
Since p = mx, we have x A x = o. Since x rE 0, this implies that

x=
for some function

Xof time.

Now

and therefore

so that

x lies on a fixed ray through the origin.

x/llxll is constant, we

that is,
(6.3)
where r = Ilxll.
In any event, in all cases the particle x moves in a plane. We may therefore
restrict our attention to the plane. That is, we can consider a "new" mechanical
system where M = 1E2 - {O} and its Riemann metric, the function V = Per),
etc. Let us introduce polar "coordinates" in the plane. Then a/ao preserves the
metric and the potential. If -< r, 0, p" po>- are the corresponding coordinates
on T*(M), then Proposition 5.2 implies that
(6.4)

Po = const.

(Note that this is really just that part of (6.1) that we haven't yet used.) Now
in terms of polar coordinates, the Euclidean metric has the form of Eq. (8.7)
of Chapter 9, so that the Riemann metric associated to the mass m which is
m X the Euclidean metric is given by

II (r, 8) 112 =

m{r2

+ r 282}.

In particular, the associated map from T(M) to T*(M) is given by
Pr

=

and

mr

(6.5)

Thus (6.4) says that
(6.4')
To understand the significance of (6.4'), consider a curve x(·) in the plane.
Consider the region 'U bounded by the portion of the ray from 0 to x(O), the
portion of the ray from 0 to x(t), and the curve x(·) from 0 to t. (See Fig. 13.1.)
Then

~1 r2 dO =

Thus (6.4') is exactly the content of Kepler's second law: The particle sweeps
out area at a constant rate.
Thus we have seen that the spherical symmetry of the system implies that
the motion is in a plane and that Kepler's second law holds.

We can now use the following procedure for solving the equations of motio~:
First, for a given angular momentum find the various solution curves r(·) of (6.7).
For a solution r(·), determine 8(·) by integrating = A/mr 2 to get

8(t) =

lto( mr~( s) ds + const.

(6.9)

We can obtain a good bit of information about the nature of the solutions
of (6.7) by using the law of conservation of energy. We draw a graph of the
function, as shown in Fig. 13.2. Suppose that the trajectory r(·) has the constant energy El = tmr2 Q(r). Then if the set {r : Q(r) ~ E 1} is bounded,
r(t) must always be in this set, since tmr2 ~ o. In fact, suppose that the
interval a ~ r ~ b is such that Q(a) = Q(b) = El and Q(b E) > El and
Q(a - E) > E 1 for small E. Then if a ~ r(t o) ~ b for some value of to, it follows

+

+

526

13.6

CLASSICAL MECHANICS

that a ~ r(t) ~ b for all t. Furthermore, if Q(r) < E 1 for a < r < b, then for
a < r(t o) < b, r(t) cannot vanish. The particle is thus moving to one of the
limits r = a and r = b. If we use the law of conservation of energy, we see that
~mf2

Et,

so that

dr

= r= ±

lEI - Q(r) .

(6.10)

In particular, if Q'(a) ~ 0 and Q'(b) ~ 0, the integral in (6.10) converges, so
that it takes a finite amount of time for r to get to a or to b. Thus (since
dr/dt = Q'(r) ~ 0), the function r oscillates between a and b taking the time

to get from one side to the other.
If {r: Q(r) ~ E 2} is not bounded, then the motion with energy E2 need
not be bounded. For instance, suppose that Q(r) < E2 for r > a. Then if
r(t o) > a and r(t o) < 0, T will decrease until it hits a at which time it will turn
around and then go off to infinity; if f(to) > 0, then r will simply go to infinity.
The trajectory in this case is that of r coming in from infinity, turning around
at a, and then going back to infinity.
We recall that this is a descriptive analysis of the function r(·). The curve
8(·) is then to be determined by (6.9).
Frequently we are interested in the tajectories as curves in the r8-plane
without reference to the time dependence. Suppose that the energy is E and the
angular momentum is A. For the range where r ~ 0 we can substitute

Let us consider the mechanical system consisting of n particles each having

!mllld I l1 2 + ... + !mnlld nl1 2
!mI[(x I)2 + U/)2 + (ZI)2] + ... + !mn[(xn)2 + (yn)2 + (zn)2]

is the kinetic energy of the system. As we indicated in Section 1, we may wish
to restrict the manifold M to be that subset of 1E3 X ... X 1E3 for which no
ai = aj for any i '1'" J. Let us further assume that the potential energy depends
only on the mutual distances between the particles. That is, let us assume that

U(ar, ... ,an) = P(lla2 -

alii, Ilaj - alii, ... , Ilan - an-III).

Then if A is a Euclidean motion of 1E3 and we apply A simultaneously to all the
particles, the kinetic and potential energy are conserved. That is, the transformation
is an isometry of the Riemann metric on M and preserves U.
Let -<xl, yI, zr, ... ,xn, yn, zn> be the Cartesian coordinates on M,
and let
be the eorresponding coordinates on T*(M). Now a/ax is the vector field
representing the infinitesimal translation in the x-direction in 1E3. Therefore,

-<Xl + t, yr, zr, x 2 + t, y2, Z2, ... ,xn + t, yn, zn>.

We can therefore apply Proposition 5.2 to conclude that the function
Px1

+ Px2 + ... + pxn

is constant in any trajectory. This function is known as the total linear momentum in the x-direction. Similarly, the total linear momentum in the y-direction,
Pyl

+ ... + pyn,

and the total linear momentum in the z-direction,
Pzl

+ ... + pzn,

must be conserved. If we define pi E 1E3 by setting pi

= -< Pxt, Pyt, Pzt> , then

13.7

THE TWO-BODY PROBLEM

529

we can say that the 1E 3-valued funct~on
pl+p2+ ... +pn

must be conserved. This is the law of conservation of total linear momentum.
(For two particles the assertion that PI + P2 is conserved is just Newton's law
of "equality of action and reaction". In our setup we see that this law is a
reflection of the invariance of the physical situation under translations.)
The vector field x(ajay) - y(ajax) represents infinitesimal rotation about
the z-axis in 1E3. Therefore,
la

X ayl_- y ax 1 + x ay2 - y ax2

represents simultaneous infinitesimal rotation of all the particles about the z-axis.
Therefore, the function
q",lPyl - qylP",l

+ ... + qxnpyn -

qynp",n

is conserved. This is the law of conservation of total angular momentum about
the z-axis. Similarly, we obtain the law of conservation of total angular momentum about the x- and y-axes. If we set
qi =

-< qxl, qyl, qzj>-

E 1E 3 ,

we can combine the three equations by saying that the function
ql 1\ pI

+ ... + qn

1\ pn

with values in 1\2(1E3) is constant on the trajectdries of the motion.
Let us examine more closely the law of conservation of total linear momentum. In view of the fact that

etc., we have pi = mi(daijdt), and thus
d (

mla

+ m2a 2 + ... + mnan) =

/'

In other words, the center of mass

C = ml a1
ml

+ ... + mnan
+ ... + m,n

moves in a straight line with constant velocity.
Suppose there are only two particles. Then it is reasonable to introduce the
center of mass
C = ml a 1 + m2 a 2
ml + m2
and the relative position vector

530

as new coordinates. If we solve for a land a 2 , we get

K(C, d) =

while U(C, d) = P(lldll).
Thus the motions of the system have the following description: The center

satisfies the equations of motion of a single particle with mass

in the central-force field with potential U = P(lldll). We can thus apply the
results of the preceding section to determine the motions of the particle. In
particular, if P(lldll) = a/lldll is the inverse-square potential, the corresponding
two-body problems can be completely solved.
Note that if m2 is very large compared to mb then C is very close to a 2.
In this case d(·) is a good approximation to the motion of the smaller particle
relative to the larger one.
This is the situation that arises, for example, in the study of the motion of
of the planets relative to the sun.
8. LAGRANGE'S EQUATIONS

Our discussion of mechanics has led us to a certain kind of vector field X on
T*(M), where M is the configuration manifold. In the case where H = K
U,
the Riemann metric giving K induces an isomorphism .c [that is, a diffeomorphism which is linear on each Tx(lI1)] from T(M) to T*(M). We therefore
obtain a vector field Y on T(M) such that .c*Yv = X,c(V) at any v E T(M).
We can therefore inquire about the form of this vector field Y in terms of local
coordinates <ql, ... , qn, ql, ... ,qn»- on T(M), associated with coordinates
<Xl, ... ,xn»- on M. Suppose that the Riemann metric is given by

+

II(qi, ... , qn)1I2

=

L Oii(qi, ... ,qn)(iqj.

If <qi, ... , qn, pi, ... ,pn»- are corresponding local coordinates on T*(M),
then the diffeomorphism .c is given by

(8.1)

We could proceed to use (8.1) to obtain the local expression for .c and thereby
the local expression for Y. However, it is more convenient to argue a little
differently. Let L be the function on T(M) defined by

that is,

531

L= K- U,

where K(v) = !llvl1 2and U(v) = D(7I"(v» are the kinetic and potential energy
expressed as functions on T(M). We can rewrite (8.1) as
i
aL
p = aqi'

(8.3)

Then for any l E T*(M), we have
H(l) = (Jr1(l), l) - L(£-l(l».

(8.4)

In fact, by definition,
(£-l(l), l) =

IIll12 = 1I£-1(l)11 2,

so that
(£-1(l), l) - L(£-l(l»

=

IIll12 - !llll12 + D(7I"(l»

= !llll12 + U(l)
= H(l).

In terms of local coordinates we can write (8.4) as

H(q1, ... ,qn, pI, ... ,pn) =

L

p'qi - L(qt, ... , qn, qt, ... , qn),

where the qi are regarded as functions of the q's and p's via
the map £-1 as

qi = qi,
since H(l) =

!llll12 + D(7I"(l».

We can write

Now let vO = -<q 10, ... , qn(.), q1(.), ... , qnO>- be a solution curve

532

CLASSICAL MECHANICS

on T(1I1). The first of Eqs. (8.7) says that we are dealing with a system of secondorder differential equations which is given implicitly by the second of Eqs. (8.7).
Equations (8.7) are known as Lagrange's equations.
For certain purposes Lagrange's equations are very convenient. We illustrate by establishing the "principle of mechanical similarity". Note that
Eqs. (8.7) are unchanged if we replace L by cL, where c is any nonzero constant.
Suppose that 111 is an open subset of a vector space with linear coordinates
Xl, •.• , xn and that the Riemann metric is given by 2: Yij(/r/, where the Yij are
constant. Let ma denote the linear map consisting of multiplication by a > 0,
that is, ma(x \ ... , xn) = -< ax \ ... , axn>-. Suppose that U is a homogeneous
function of degree p, so that
U(ax1, ... , axn)

=

aPU(x1, ... , xn).

Now let us change our time scale by a factor (3, replacing t by s = (3t. Then

In other words, replacing qi by aqi and t by (3t carries solutions into solution:
if we change the linear scale by a and change the time scale by a 1 - ( / 2)p, we
obtain an isomorphic situation. For instance, if U is homogeneous of degree -1
(as in the case of an inverse-square law of attraction), then (3 = a 3/2 • In particular, the period of any periodic orbit is proportional to the ~-power of its
linear dimension, which is just Kepler's third law. We thus see that Kepler's
third law is an exact consequence of the inverse-square law of attraction.
Returning to the study of the general Lagrangian system, we observe again
that it is a system of second-order differential equations. We can therefore
apply the fundamental existence and uniqueness theorem to it to conclude that
jor every x E 111 and jor every t E Tx(1I1) there is a unique curve CO which is a
trajectory oj the system and jor which C(O) = x and C'(O) = t.
9. VARIATIONAL PRINCIPLES

The function L plays a crucial role in the study of variational principles of
mechanics. Consider the following problem: Let p and q be two points of M,
and let t1 < t2 be two real numbers. For any differentiable curve C defined on

I[C]

(9.1)

ltl

Note that C'(t) E T(M) and L is a function on T(M), so the integrand makes
sense. Among all curves joining p to q, find that curve for which I[C] takes on
its minimum value. We shall see t.hat a necessary condition for I[C] to be a
minimum is that it be a trajectory of a mechanical system. (In fact, if a suitable
notion of neighborhood is introduced on the space of curves, it is also a necessary
condition for C to be even a local minimum.)
Before establishing this result, it is convenient to have another expression
for I[C]. As before, let .c be the map of T(M) -+ T*(M) given by the Riemann
metric. Let'C be the curve in T*(M) given by

'C(t) = .c(C'(t»).
Then

I[C]

C join p to q. If C is to minimize the integral I, then the derivative

This must hold for all i. Since (9.6) and (9.8) are exactly (5.2), we can assert:
Proposition 9.1. A necessary condition for C to minimize the functional

I[C] is that C is a trajectory of the corresponding dynamical system.

The question of when this necessary condition is also sufficient is a more
complicated one. We shall not discuss it in any generality here, but refer the
reader to any standard source on the calculus of variations.

q
----~,

Fig. 13.3

By the way, we can derive a bonus from (9.5). Suppose that we consider
the following problem: Let N 1 and N 2 be two submanifolds (Fig. 13.3) of M,
and suppose that we require that C minimize I among all curves joining N 1 to N 2
and not merely among those joining p to q. In this case (9.5) will have to vanish
for all vector fields Z which are tangent to N 1 at p and to N 2 at q. Now observe

536

13.9

CLASSICAL MECHANICS

that if G is a solution to this minimum problem, it certainly is a solution to the
problem of minimizing I among all curves joining p to q. In particular, G must
be a trajectory of the mechanical system. As the reader can easily check, this
implies that
z ..J (J - (D-zH) (C(t)) dt = 0

k

J

for all vector fields Z. Thus, if G solves the more difficult minimization problem,
we must have
Now
and
Since if p '=/= q we can choose Zp arbitrarily in T peN 1) and Zq arbitrarily in
Tq(N 2), we conclude in this case that G must also satisfy

In other words, the curve G must be orthogonal to the submanifolds N 1 and N 2.
Although our statement of Proposition 9.1 was couched in the framework of
dynamical systems, it actually can be formulated in a more general context.
Let L be any function on T(M)-not necessarily of the type K - U. We can
then define the integral I as in (9.1) and again pose the minimization problem.
This is the typical problem in the calculus of variations. We have already
discusse<\ this problem from a different point of view in Section 3.15. We leave
to the reader the task of showing that our arguments carryover in this more
general case if the matrix

(ax~~Xj)
is nowhere singular. (Here the map £ of T(M)

GEODESIC COORDINATES

10. GEODESIC COORDINATES

In this section we depart momentarily from the study of mechanics in order to
exhibit some applications of the results of the preceding paragraphs to the
study of Riemann manifolds. Note that a Riemann manifold always defines a
mechanical system by its kinetic energy if we set the potential energy equal to
zero. It is this special kind of mechanical system that we wish to study in this
section.
Let M be a finite-dimensional manifold with a Riemann metric and, as
above, define L on T(M) by setting
L(v) =

illvl1 2 •

This then determines a vector field Yon T(M) which corresponds to the system
of differential equations (8.7) in terms of local coordinates. Let p be a point of M.
For every ~ E Tp(M) there is a unique trajectory CEO such that
q(O) = ~.

In terms of local coordinates, if ~
CE(t) =

where

dq~

with the initial conditions
qE(O)

=

xi(p),

qi

By the fundamental existence and uniqueness theorem the functions
are
defined for sufficiently small t. We can regard CE(t) as dependent on both ~ and t.
In other words, we have a map C.O assigning to each ~ E Tp(M) and each
sufficiently small t a point of M. The map C.(·) is, in fact, defined in some
neighborhood of T p(M) X {O} C T p(M) X IR.
The above is true for any Lagrangian function. In the case of no potential
energy we can say a lot more. Let s be a real number. Consider the curve
CE(s .), that is,
CE(st) = -<ql(st), ... , qf(st) >-.
Then (suppressing the subscript
computations)

~

In other words,

Thus the curve

C~(s·)

:~ (ql(.), ... , qn(-») JI.t = o.

is again a trajectory of the system, and we clearly have

CHs ·)10 = sC~(-)lo = s~.
By the uniqueness theorem for differential equations we thus must have
C~(st) = C.~(t).

(l0.1)

We are therefore led to define a map, which we shall call exp, from
Tp(M) - 7 M by setting
(10.2)
exp (~) = C~(l).
Note that the map exp is defined and differentiable in some neighborhood of
the origin in Tp(M). In fact, by (10.1),
exp

W

=

C~mll(11 ~II),

where now UII ~lllies on the unit sphere in T p(M) [the unit sphere with respect
to the Euclidean metric given by the scalar product on Tp(M)J. Since the unit
sphere is compact, there is some f > 0 such that C~(t) is defined for all 'T/ on the
unit sphere and all It I < f. Thus exp will be defined for all II ~II < f.
The map exp is a differentiable map from some neighborhood of the origin
in the vector space T p(M) into the manifold. Let us compute
exp*o: To[Tp(M)J

-7

Tp(M).

Let ~ E Tp(M), and let us consider the straight line through 0, l~, in Tp(M)
given by l~(t) = t~. Since Tp(M) is a vector space, we can identify To[Tp(M)]
with Tp(M) via the identity chart, in which case we identify
l~(O)

with

~.

But
exp

[l~(t)J

Ct~(l)

C~(t),

(10.3)

13.10

GEODESIC COORDINATES

and the tangent to this curve at 0 is

just~.

539

In other words,

exp*o [l[(O)] = ~.
Thus, if we identify To[Tp(M)] with Tp(M), we can assert that
exp*o: To[Tp(M)]

~

Tp(M)

is given by
(10.4)

In particular, the map exp*o is nonsingular, so that by the implicit-function
theorem the map exp is a diffeomorphism in some neighborhood of the origin.
We have thus constructed a diffeomorphism exp from some neighborhood
of the origin in T p(M) into M, which by (10.3) carries straight lines through the
origin into trajectories through p. In the case of no potential energy the trajectories are called geodesics for reasons which will soon become apparent. If we
identify T p(M) with V by some chart (U, ex), we can then use exp to introduce
a new chart (U', na) by setting
n;;1(~a) = exp

W.

The chart n" has the property that n,,(p) = 0 and na carries geodesics through p
into straight lines through the origin. The chart (U', na) is called a geodesic
normal chart, and corresponding coordinates are called geodesic normal coordinates
onM.
Let us consider the curve C~O = exp (. ~) which is defined for 0 ~ t ~ 1
so long as II ~II < E. We have

I[C~(·)]

=

f01 L(q(t)) dt = ! 101IICHt) 112 dt.

But, by the conservation of energy, for any trajectory of our system we have
H 0 £(C'(t)) = const. In this case, since U = 0, H 0 £(C'(t)) = L(C'(t)) =
!IICHt)11 2= const. Since CE(O) = ~,we have IIC~(t) II = II ~II, and therefore

(7], CW») = 0 for any fJ wpich is tangent to exp Sliell, where SlItll is the sphere
of radius II~II in Tp(M). (See Fig. 13.4.) In other words, not only are the rays
through the origin orthogonal to the spheres in the Euclidean metric of Tp(M),
but also the image of a ray through the origin under exp is orthogonal to the
image of a sphere about p in the Riemann metric of M.
In particular, we can transfer "polar coordinates" on Tp(M) to M so as to
get "geodesic polar coordinates" on M. This has the following effect: Let r be
the "radial coordinate", that is, r is the function defined in U by

suppose that r E Tx(M), where x = exp ~ for some ~ E Tp(M). Then we can
write r = rl + r2, where rl is some multiple of CW) and r2 is tangent to
exp SII~II. By the above result, (rI, r2) = 0, so
IIrl1 2 = IIrll1 2 + IIr211 2
and we obtain (10.6), with equality holding only if IIr211 = O.
We are now in the same fortunate position we were in Section 9 of Chapter 9.

In short,

Theorem 10.1. Let E > be so small that the map exp is a diffeomorphism
onB. = HE Tp(M) : II~II < E}. Let x = exp ~ be a point of U = exp B •.
Then the geodesic C~ joining p to x has length II ~II, and any other curve D
joining p to x is strictly longer unless D differs from C~ only in a (monotone)
change of parameter. In other words, loosely speaking, geodesics are locally
the shortest curves joining two points.

Since we have come this far, let us show in addition that geodesics also
locally minimize the energy. Let D be any curve from [0,1] to M. Then by
Schwarz's inequality we have

Now equality holds in the second inequality only if D'(t) is proportional to C'(t),
while equality holds in the first only if IID'(t) II = const. We thus conclude that
IID'(t)1I = II~II, that is, D'(t) = C'(t). In short, we have proved:
Proposition 10.1. Under the hypotheses of Theorem 10.1 the curve C~(-)
is a strict absolute minimum for I[C] among all curves C: [0,1] -+ M such
that C(O) = p and C(l) = x.

11. EULER'S EQUATIONS

Under certain circumstances, which we shall presently describe, the equations of
motion take a particularly elegant form. The first special assumption that we
shall make is that there is an isomorphism of T(M) with M X V. More precisely,
we assume that there is a diffeomorphism, £, of T(M) with ltf X V such that
£(~) = <.m, v> I where m = 'Ira), and for each x EM the map .~ t-+ v of
T:.:(M) -+ V is a linear isomorphism of vector spaces. For example, if M is an
open subset of V, then the identity chart defines such an isomorphism

A slightly less trivial example is furnished by the n-dimensional torus Tn =
8 1 X ... X 8 1• Then we can introduce "angular variables" 01, ... , On, where
0' is the angular variable on the ith circle. We thus obtain n vector fields

defines the desired map L. We shall encounter a more complicated example in
the next section. We should point out that only very special kinds of manifolds
admit such an isomorphism L of T(M) with M X V.
For the rest of this section we shall identify T(M') with M X V and T*(M)
with M X V* via the corresponding (adjoint) isomorphism.
The rule which identifies each T",(M) with V can be regarded as a V-valued
linear differential form on M. Let us denote this form by w. In other words,
the identification L is given by L(O = (~, w",) if ~ E TAM). We can therefore
study the V-valued exterior two-form dw. For each pair of tangent. vectors
~, 7] E T",(M) we obtain (7], ~ ..J dw) as an element of V. Now we can identify ~
and 7] with vectors of V. We thus obtain a V-valued antisymmetric bilinear form
on V; if we call it a"" we have
a",(v, w) = (7], ~..J dw),

where (~, w",) = v, (7], w",) = w, and ~, 7] E T",(M). Note that, in general, the
bilinear form a", depends on x. Our second fundamental assumption about the
identification L is that a", is independent of x. That is, we assume that there is a
V-valued bilinear form a such that
(Y, X ..J dw) = a(X, w), (Y, w»)

(11.1)

for all vector fields X and Y on M.
In the examples given above (the open subset of Von the torus) dw = 0,
so that (11.1) holds trivially. In the next section we shall come across a case
where dw ~ O.
To understand (11.1) a little better, let us introduce the following notation:
For any v E V let (j be the vector field on M given by «(j,-w)", = v for all x E M.
Then for any v, wE V, we have

('11;, (j ..J dw)

= D,,(11;, w) - Dw«(j, w) - ([(j, 11;], w).

Now (11;, w) = wand «(j, w) = v are constants, so the first two terms on the right
disappear. Thus we can rewrite (11.1) as
a(v, w) = -([(j, 11;], w).

(ILl')

For the kinetic energy of a mechanical system we need a Riemann metric
on M. A Riemann metric on M gives a scalar product on each T",(M). This
means giving a scalar product ( , )", on V for each x E M. Our third special
assumption is that ( , )", does not depend on x. Thus we are given a scalar
product on V which gives the Riemann metric on M via the identification of
T(M) with M X V.
We wish to describe the vector field on T*(M) as X'-dH, where H = K
U,
K being the kinetic energy'of the Riemann metric and U being some potential
energy. Since T*(M) = M X V*, a vector field X on T*(M) can be uniquely
written as X = Xl
X 2 , where Xl is t!1ngent to M and X 2 is tangent to V*.
Furthermore, we can regard Xl as a V-valued function and X 2 as a V*-valued

12. RIGID-BODY MOTION

We shall apply the results of the previous section to the study of the motion of
a rigid body. For simplicity, we shall confine ourselves to the study of the
motion of a rigid body with one point fixed. The more general case where the
body as a whole is allowed to move can be handled by similar methods. (Frequently, by considering first the motion of the center of gravity, the more
general case can be split into two parts: the motion of the center of gravity and
the motion of the body relative to the center of gravity. This then reduces the
problem to the one we are studying.)
In order to exhibit the generality of our method, we shall consider the
equations of motion of a rigid body in P. Only at the end will we make use of
the fact that n = 3. Let us fix some positive orthonormal system "drawn through
the fixed point of the body". In other words, we fix some initial position Xo =
-< b 1, ••• , bn >- of the body. Any other position, Xl, of the body can be obtained
from Xo by a rotation: Xl = RlXo. Let R(t) = eAt be a one-parameter group
of rotations. Then
is a curve of possible positions of the body. The tangent to this curve at X 1 will
be denoted by Ax!.
Thus Ax!
E Tx!(M). If X2 = R2XO = R2Rl-1 RlXO =
R2RllXb then AX2 is the tangent to the curve R2R(t)xo = R2R~lRlR(t)xo,
so that AX2 = (R2RllhAxl' It is clear from its definition that AX! = 0 if and
only if A = O.
We can regard the map A ~ AX! as a map from the space of skew adjoint
linear transformations to Tx)(M). Let V denote the space.of skew adjoint linear
transformations. Then since
d'lm=lm
V
d' M = n(n 2- 1)
and the map A ~ AX) is an injection, we conclude that it is an isomorphism.
We thus have a trivialization T(M) ~ M X V. Consequently, we get a Vvalued linear differential form w, as in Section 11.
Let us describe once more the meaning of wx: Tx(M) ~ V. If ~ E TAM)
represents an infinitesimal motion of the body, then since the body is rigid, we
can regard ~ as an infinitesimal rotation of the body relative to an observer
situated outside the body (fixed in space). Thus ~ = B for some B E V, say.
Then <~, w) is the corresponding infinitesimal rotation expressed in terms of
the basis attached to the body; that is, <~, w) = R~IBRI if X = RIXo .
. We denote by A the vector field X ~ Ax corresponding to A E V. Let CPt
be the one-parameter group generated by !J for some BE V. Note that at any
X2 = R2XO we have cP
X2 = R2eBtxO' Then at any Xl = RlXO we have

(12.1)

We now show how a mass distribution on the body determines a Riemann metric
on M. Let p be a particle on the body with mass m. We will assume that the
particle p has coordinates <. pI, ... , pn> relative to the axes drawn on the
body. Suppose that the body is at position x = <. b1 , ••• , bn >. Then the
particle p will be situated at the point p Ib 1 + ... + pnb n E P. If R(t) = eAt
is a one-parameter group of rotations, then when the body is at R1R(t)x the
particle p will be situate~_ at
Rl[plR(t)b 1

+ ... + pnR(t)b n] =

RIR(t)p.

Thus the velocity of the particle p as the body undergoes the motion generated
by A is R1Ap, and the kinetic energy of the particle p is -lml/R 1Api/2 =
!mIIApI/2, since Rl is an orthogonal linear transformation. We define the kinetic
energy of Ax to be the total kinetic energy of all the particles of the body. Thus

J ml/Apl/2.

(12.2)

body

Note that I/Axll depends only on A, so that our third requirement of the last
section is satisfied, provided (12.2) does indeed define a norm on V. (Note: That
the mass distribution could be such that Ap = 0 for all p in {p : m(p) > O}
does not imply that A = O. For example, suppose that all the mass were concentrated along a line l. If A represents infinitesimal rotation about l, so that
Ap = 0 for pEl, then I/AI/ = O. However, it is clear that if the set of p for
which m > 0 spans P, then (12.2) defines a Riemann metric. In fact,

I/AI/

=

0 =>

Ap =

0

for all p belonging to a spanning set, and thus A = 0.)
Let us examine the scalar product given in (12.2) a little more closely. Let f
denote the linear function on lEn ® lEn corresponding to the scalar product on
P (which is a bilinear form); in other words,
f(al

® b1 + ... + ak ® bk) =

Let s be any element of V
given by

+ ... + (ak' bk).

V. Then s defines a bilinear form on Hom(P)

s(A, B)

f(A

Note that if the tensor s is symmetric, so is the corresponding bilinear form. In

our present context the scalar product (12.2) comes from the tensor I

A simple case of these equations arises when there is no potential, that is,

.

In other words, A = const. The motion of the body consists of a steady rotation
about some axis fixed on the body. Of course, this means that for an observer
in space also, the body undergoes a steady rotation about a fixed axis.
Next, let us consider the case of an axially symmetric rigid body moving
freely; that is, II = 12 and U = o. The equations of motion then become

Thus for an observer situated on the body the instantaneous axis of rotation
describes a circle around the axis of symmetry of the body. This motion is
known as regular precession. (This motion should not be confused with the astronomical precession of the earth's axis, which is due to the gravitational action
of the sun and moon.)
If no two of II, 1 2 , and I a are equal, then the equations of motion can still
be solved in terms of integrals, although the expression is rather complicated.
We refer the reader to any standard book on mechanics for the details.
So far we have been considering the motion with no potential. If V rf 0,
then Eqs. (12.4) are usually not so easy to solve. Let us treat the case of a
symmetrical top; that is, II = 12 and U is given by the gravitational potential.
In order to solve this problem it is convenient to use the Euler angles of astronomy as the local coordinates on M. In order to avoid confusion, we reproduce
the definitions here: We let ~x, ~y, ~z be the basis vectors of lEa corresponding to
the rectangular coordinates x, y, z, where we take the origin of lEa to be the fixed
point of the body. We may assume that the center of mass of the body is distinct
from the fixed point-otherwise there will be no gravitational force acting on
the body. It is easy to see that the center of mass C lies on the axis of symmetry.
We shall assume that the vectors drawn on the body are such that ba points in
the direction from the fixed point to the center of mass, i.e., from 0 to c. Then

The vector (a/acp)x represents infinitesimal rotation about b a, so that

Furthermore, since (8., n) = 0, the projection of 8. onto the plane spanned by

Thus, just as in our treatment of the central-force problem, for a fixed
value of Pa/a", and Pa/a"" the motion of 8 is determined by a one-dimensional
mechanical system whose energy is given by (12.9). After solving this mechanical system for 8, we can then obtain 1/;(.) and <p(') by integrations from (12.8).
In order to obtain qualitative information about the behavior of the solutions
8(·), we can apply the method of Section 5 to our one-dimensional mechanical
system. Note that if C 1 ~ C 2 (as would be the case if the body were "spinning
fast"), the kinetic energy tends to infinity as 8 --t 0 and as 8 --t Tr. We therefore conclude that 8 oscillates between two values 0 < 81 ::::; 8 ::::; 82 < Tr.
In other words, the axis of symmetry of the body executes a periodic up and down
motion (called nutation). As 8 oscillates, I/; satisfies (12.8). Let us graph the
curve that b a traces out on the unit sphere. If C 1 > C2 cos 8 > 0 for 81 ::::;
8 ::::; 82, then I/; > 0 although it oscillates in magnitude. The motion is thus as
given in Fig. 13.6. Another possibility is that
and
so that I/; is negative near 8 = 81 and positive max 8 = 82, In this case the
average of I/; ovp.r a period is still positive, so that the motion is as shown in

A limiting case is where C 1 - C2 cos 81 = 0, where the motion of ba is as
shown in Fig. 13.8. (This is the case that arises if the axis of a spinning top is
held fixed at some position 8, '" and then allowed to fall.)
The motion of the axis of body around the z-axis in all these cases is called
precession. It should be remembered that all this time the top is spinning about
its axis with constant angular momentum C2.

Suppose we are given a mechanical system on a manifold l\{ with energy
H = K + U. Suppose that the "force field" dU vanishes at some Xo E l\{.
Then the constant curve C(t) ~ Xo is a tra.jectory of the system. In fact, let us

K(q, q)

= !l: Yij(q)qiqj,

by the one corresponding to the Euclidean metric at xo,
K 2 (q, q)

= !l: Yij(O,

... , O)qiqi.

We thus obtain a mechanical system H 2 whose corresponding equations
(5.1) are actually linear. [The reader should check, as an exercise, that these
equations are exactly the equations of variation (introduced in Section 2) of the
vector field X-dH along the curve C(t) = -<0, ... , ... 0> in T*(M).]
Of course, as time increases, the values of qi and pi might become quit~
large and the linear approximations useless. However, under certain circumstances we can guarantee that qi and pi remain small for all time. In fact,
suppose that the quadratic form l: aijxix i is positive definite. Then U has a
strict minimum at xo-say U(xo) = o. In particular, if we start at Xo with a
kinetic energy K = E, where E is sufficiently small, then x will be restricted to
the neighborhood of Xo defined by U(x) :::;; E, and the momenta will be restricted
by the condition K :::;; E, since, by the conservation of energy, K
U == E.
(See Fig. 13.9.) Thus the qi and the pi will remain small. This does not mean
that the solutions to the original mechanical system with Hamiltonian H will
remain close to one fixed solution curve of the linearized system. It does mean

Fig. 13.9

that for any short interval of time (that is, a short interval near any time in the
future), the trajectory will be close to some trajectory of the linearized system.
It is therefore important to study the behavior of such mechanical systems.
Weare thus interested in the following kind of mechanical system: The configuration space M is a vector space. The Riemann metric is given by a Euclidean
metric on the manifold. The potential energy is a positive definite quadratic
form on this vector space. Let us choose rectangular coordinates x 1, ... , xn

and Lagrange's equations become
(13.1)
(Of course, these are just the Euler equations (11.15) for the case at hand where

Equations (13.1) can be written more suggestively as follows: Let A be the
linear transformation whose matrix is (aii). Stated invariantly, A is the unique

Then the trajectories v(·) of the system are the solutions of the second-order

(13.3)
dt 2 = -Av.
To find the actual solutions of (13.1) and (13.3) we apply Theorem 3.1 of
Chapter 5. According to that theorem, if M is finite-dimensional, we can find an
orthonormal basis e1, ... , en of eigenvalues of A. In other words, if Zi are the

Thus the general motion is a superposition of independent oscillations, the
frequency of each oscillation being determined by the eigenvalues {Ai}. That
is why the mechanical system (13.1) is called a system of "small oscillations".
14. SMALL OSCILLATIONS (Continued)

So far, we have been considering the linearized equations (13.1) as an approximation to a finite-dimensional mechanical system. The philosophy has been
that the solutions to the actual mechanical system exist, but are hard to find.
We use (13.3) as good approximating equations.

It turns out that the method has more extensive applications, even to the
case of infinite-dimensional systems where the very existence of solutions to the
"actual" mechanical systems may be difficult to establish. Let us illustrate by
the mechanical system consisting of a stretched string which is held fixed at two
endpoints. For simplicity in illustration, we shall assume that the string is
restricted to move in the xy-plane, although this is in no way essential to the
argument. Let us assume that the string is homogeneous and that the two
fixed points are (0,0) and (0, 1). Then the configuration space should be all
possible smooth curves joining (0,0) to (0, 1). Thus the curve shown in Fig.
13.10 would be a possible element of our configuration space. In some sense,

554

the configuration is an "infinite-dimensional manifold" and with suitable work
this idea can be made precise. However, what is of interest to us is behavior
near the "equilibrium" curve C(t) = (t,O). For such curves we will have
dx/dt > 0, and so the curve can be described by using x as independent variable,
i.e., by giving a function u(x}. In other words, we are replacing the big configuration space by the approximating vector space V of all functions u of one
variable, with u(O) = u(l) = o. Thus V is regarded as the "tangent space"
to our system, in the sense that u is the "tangent vector" to the curve CB (-),
where CB(T) = CT, SUeT)). (Remember that our configuration space is a
collection of curves, so that a curve in our configuration space is a one-parameter
family of curves.) Now we expect the "kinetic energy" of u to be the total of
the kinetic energy of all the particles on the string. The particle at T has velocity
U(T) and therefore kinetic energy imU(T)2. If we assume that the mass density
is constant, we thus get

as the expression for the kinetic energy. This makes V into a pre-Hilbert space
as in Section 6 of Chapter 6.
We expect that the potential energy depends on the stretching of the string,
i.e., that it is some function of the length:
D(C)

Equation (13.3) thus becomes
(14.1)
Note that we have derived (14.1) by reasoning by analogy. We have not
formulated the actual (nonlinear) infinite-dimensional mechanical system, nor
have we any guarantee that there is one that can be solved. Furthermore, we
don't actually know the function F. We only need to know its form and the
value of F'(l). Nevertheless, Eq. (14.1) gives a good explanation of observed
physical phenomena.
The solution of (14.1) proceeds just as in the finite-dimensional case due to
the fact that the operator A with the boundary conditions u(O) = u(l) = 0
is a Sturm-Liouville system, so the results of Sections 6 and 7 of Chapter 6
apply. In fact, we can choose the functions
un(x)

sin (mrx)

as an orthogonal basis of eigenvectors of A, where
n2(c/m)7r 2. Thus the general solution is given by
Ut(x)

has the eigenvalue

In other words, the general solution is a superposition

These can be regarded as "standing waves", as, for example, in Fig. 13.11.

As another illustration of this method, let us consider the "vibrating membrane" in n-dimensions. Here we are given a domain D with almost regular
boundary in lEn. We consider a stretched membrane in IE n+ l = lEn X lEI
which is fastened along aD in P X {O}. Again, as our linear approximation V
to the configuration manifold, we take the space of all functions u on D which
vanish on aD. To be precise, we let V be the space of functions which we
defined, are of class C 2 in some neighborhood TI, and vanish on aD. Thus the
membrane is the surface in IE n + 1 whose points are of the form
<x\ ... , x n , u(x l ,

where <Xl, ... ,x n > ED. As before, we define the kinetic energy as
K(u)

= t JD u 2,

while the potential energy is to be some function of the total volume (area)
which vanishes at p.(D). Now the total volume (area) of the hypersurface is
given by (see Exercise 4.3, Chapter 10)

L~1 + 2: (::iY·

Thus, as before,

U2 (u)

~ f 2: (*~Y = ~ D[u, u],

where D is the Dirichlet integral introduced in Section 11 of Chapter 12. By
Green's formula we have (since u = 0 on aD)
D[u, u] = -

Thus the operator A of (13.3) is given by

and Eq. (13.3) becomes

Note that this is exactly (14.1) if n = 1. In order to solve (14.2), we must find
a complete set of eigenvalues for (14.2). If {un} is such a basis, where "Ai is the
eigenvalue associated to Ui, then the general solution of (14.2) would be given by

EXERCISES

In order to study the eigenvalue problem it is convenient to replace the space of
CI-functions vanishing on aD by the space Hf (where we refer back to page 361 for the
definition of the spaces Hf.) To show that this replacement is legitimate, we have:
14.1 Show that if ep is a function which is Cl in a neighborhood of 15, then ep E HD
if and only if ep vanishes on aD.
14.2 Let the operator K be defined as Kf = (1 - Il)f for smooth f and extended as
in Section 14 of Chapter 8 to a map of H. ~ H._ 2 • Let g E Ho. Since

for any

v E Hf,

conclude that there is a bounded linear map L from H{/ to Hf satisfying
(Lg,

for all v E Hf.

14.3 Letf and g be locally integrable functions on D. By this we mean thatfep and
gep are integrable for every test function ep E Co(D). We say that the differential
equation Kf = g holds weakly on D if (f, Kep) = (g, ep) for all test functions ep E Co(D).
Show that this generalizes the notion of being a solution by proving the following
lemma.

Lem.m.a. If the functions f and g are respectively in the classes C2(D) and CO(D),
then the equation Kf = g holds in the weak sense if and only if it holds in the
classical sense.
In proving this lemma you may assume that if h is a continuous function on D
such that JD hep = 0 for every test function ep, then h = O.
14.4 Prove that the operator L of Exercise 14.2 is a right inverse of K in the weak
sense. That is, show that if g E H{/ andf = Lg, then Kf = -g weakly on D.
14.5 We now want to show that f is actually in C2(D) if g is suitably smooth.
Roughly speaking, what we want to do is to "round off" f and g near the boundary of C
in such a way that we can consider the adjusted functions to be defined on the whole
of ~n, and can then apply Exercises 14.25 and 14.30 of Chapter 8.
Our rounding off process will simply be multiplication by an arbitrary but fixed
function 1/1 in Co(D). Prove, to begin with, that multiplication by such a 1/1 is a bounded
linear mapping of H. into itself for any 8.
14.6 We know that D; = ajax; is a bounded linear mapping from H. to H.-l for
every 8. Combine this fact with the result of the above exercise to show that if Kf = g

In order to consider R to be defined on ~n we have to extend t/; to ~n in an
obvious way. The proof is essentially an integration by parts.

15. CANONICAL TRANSFORMATIONS

In Sections 1 through 5 we formulated the notion of a mechanical system as a
flow of a certain type on the cotangent bundle of the configuration space. The
defining equations for the vector field X generating this flow were X ...J n =
-dH. Thus the basic property of the cotangent bundle used in singling out the
class of flows is the existence of the two-form n. It turns out that in studying
the equations of mechanics it is sometimes convenient to forget that the flow is
on the cotangent bundle and to concentrate on the form n. For instance, we may
be able to introduce charts that don't arise from the configuration manifold but
in terms of which the vector field X takes a particulary simple form. We shall
therefore want to consider a manifold N which carries a two-form n, subject to
certain restrictions which we shall describe below. On such manifolds we shall
study vector fields satisfying X j n = -dH. It will be convenient to allow H
to depend on the time t, as well as being a function on N, so that X will be a
time-dependent vector field. The reason for this is twofold. First of all, it allows

13.15

CANONICAL TRANSFORMATIONS

559

the consideration of "nonconservative" mechanical systems. Secondly, even in
the study of the systems we have introduced so far, it is sometimes convenient
to make a time-dependent change of coordinates to simplify the equations. This
has the effect of changin~ 81 time-independent vector field into a time-dependent
one. Now to the definitions:'
Definition. if.: xnanifold N is said to possess a Hamiltonian structure (or to

be a Hamiltonian manifolif) if there is an exterior two-form
such that
i) dn = 8\ and
ii) n is of maximal rank in the sense that (4~3) holds.

n defined on N

Remarks

a) As we have seen, if N = T*(M), then N is a Hamiltonian manifold
where n is given by (4.1).
b) If N is finite-dimensional, then it must be even-dimensionall In fact,
condition (ii) says that n restricted to each tangent space:is an antisymmetric
bilinear form which is nonsingular. This can happen on a; vector only if it is
even-dimensional.
c) It can be proved that if N is a finite-dimensional Hamiltonian manifold,
then one can always find local coordinates ql, ... , qn, PI, ... ,Pn such that
~\ =

L

dPi /\ dqi.

[We know this to be the case if N = T*(M).] The point of this result (which
we shall not prove here) is that locally all Hamiltonian manifolds of the same
finite dimension look alike.
We shall now single out a class of vector fields on N X IR.
Definition. The vector field X is a Hamiltonian vector field if there is a
= Hx on N X IR such that

function H

Xt = (X, dt) == 1,

(15.1)

where t is the standard coordinate on IR, regarded as a function on N X IR,

If we consider the direct sum decomposition of the tangent space of N X JR,
then condition (15.1) says that we can write

X=

(x,~),

where X is a time-dependent vector field on N; that is, X is a rule which assigns
a tangent vector X(x, t) E Tz(N) to each x and t. Since w does not involve dt,
we can write
at any time t.
X .J w = X(·, t) .J n
(15.3)
[Strictly speaking, this equality should be written as follows: Let it: N
be the map defined by it(x) = (x, t). Then

X(·, t) .J n.]

(15.2b)

Note that (15.2a) is just the condition stated at the beginning of Section 5 with
the novelty that H (and therefore X) can now depend on time.
Definition. A diffeomorphism, cp, of N X JR ~ N X JR is called a canonical
transformation if
i) cp*(w) = w - dW 1\ dt, where W = Wi' is some function depending
on cp; and

13.15

CANONICAL TRANSFORMATIONS

Fig. 13.13

ii) iP is time-preserving, i.e., iP has the form iP(x, t) = (!p(x, t), t), where
!p(', t) is a diffeomorphism of N for each t.
Observe that if iP is a canonical transformation, then so is iP- 1 and
Wq;-l = -(iP')*Wq;'

(15.4)

Also observe that if iP and if; are canonical transformations, then so is if; 0 iP,
where
(15.5)
These facts follow directly from the definitions and will be left as exercises for the
reader.
We note next that if iP is a canonical transformation and X is a Hamiltonian
vector field, then iP*(X) is also a Hamiltonian vector field. In fact,
iP*X..J [w - d(Wq;

+ iP*H)

/\ dt] = iP*X..J [iP*w - iP*(dH /\ dt)]
= iP*[X..J (w - dH /\ dt)] = O.

Thus we may take H 'P*X as
H;p*x = Wq;

+ iP*H.

(15.6)

Let X be a Haxniltonian vector field, and let iP be the map of N X IR ~ N X IR
obtained by letting the system evolve from time t = 0 according to the flow
generated by X. That is, let the map !p(', t) be defined so that the curve
t 1-+ !p(x, t) is a solution curve to the (time-dependent) vector field X which
passes through x at time t = O. To put it another way, the curve t 1-+ (!p(x, t), t)
is the solution curve to the vector field X which passes through (x, 0) at time
zero. (See Figs. 13.12 and 13.13.)
Note that it follows from the definition of iP that
iP*

(~) =

X'P(Z,t).

We claim that iP is a canonical transformation. In fact,

Note that (15.7) is just what we would expect from (15.6). In fact, rp*X = a/at,
and we may take H a/at = O.
Equations (15.6) and (15.7) are used in conjunction in the following way:
Suppose that H = H 0 H b where we know how to solve the differential
equations corresponding to H o. In other words, we can find the map ip corresponding to the vector field X 0, where X 0 ...J (w - dH 0 1\ dt) = O. If

+

X .J (w - dH 1\ dt)

=

0,

then rp*X is a vector field whose corresponding Hamiltonian function is ip*H 1
by (15.6)
This method was first introduced by Lagrange in the study of the n-body
problem. We can let H 0 be the Hamiltonian obtained by ignoring the terms in
the potential energy coming from the interaction of the planets, and let HI be
the rest of the Hamiltonian H. The solution for H 0 is then given by having the
planets move about the sun according to Kepler's laws. For simplicity in
discussion, let us restrict our attention to that portion of phase space where the
motion is elliptical. Then the motion of the planets is specified by giving the
various parameters of each ellipse (such as the plane of the ellipse, its major
axis, its eccentricity, etc.) and telling the position of the planet on its ellipse at
time t = O. This corresponds to the use of the map rp. One then regards the
equations of motion of the whole system as differential equations for the
parameters of each ellipse. This corresponds to studying the vector field rp* X.
This idea of introducing the parameters of the ellipses as "generalized" coordinates was one of the key steps leading to the notion of the invariant calculus
on manifolds.
We have seen that solving the differential equations corresponding to a
Hamiltonian H is the same as looking for a map ip satisfying (l5.7). Under
certain circumstances this can be reduced to looking for the solution to a certain
partial differential equation. Suppose that we have local coordinates ql • ••. , q..,

Equation (15.9) is known as the Hamilton-Jacobi equation.
We therefore have a prescription for (locally) solving the equations of

diffeomorphisms. Under certain circumstances, a proper choice of coordinates
allows us to solve (15.9) by the method of "separation of variables". We illustrate this method in the following examples.

This chapter has been devoted to the theory of content. For modern mathematics
the more powerful theory of Lebesgue measure and integration is needed. For onedimensional theory the reader can consult

1964.
For the general theory the reader can consult

Another way of computing certain definite integrals, involving the "residue calculus",
is discussed in a set of exercises at the end of Chapter 12, and can be read independently
after Chapters 8 and 11.
