Downloadable Learning Application
Reading about code is a good way to learn, but if you're anything like me, nothing beats a real
application. That's why I created the Canvas Learning Application - a simple (yet complete) ASP.NET MVC
website which leverages many of the ideas and tools covered in this book. The application is a Visual
Studio 2008 solution with helpful inline documentation meant to help you bridge the gap between
theory and practice. The Canvas Application and this book are pretty independent, so you can approach
this journey however you prefer.

Acknowledgement
There are countless of people who deserve thanks. This book is but a small contribution to the
incalculable time donated and knowledge shared by the software community at large. Without the
quality books, forums, newsgroup posts, blogs, libraries and open source projects, I would still be trying
to figure out why my ASP script was timing-out while looping through a recordset (stupid MoveNext).
It's no surprise that the software community has leveraged the openness of the internet more than any
other profession in order to advance our cause. What is surprising is how the phenomenon appears to
have gone unnoticed. Good!
Of course, there is one special person without whom this couldn't have happened.
To Wendy,
People call me lucky for being with someone as beautiful and intelli gent as you. They don't know the
half of it. You are not only beautiful and intelligent, but you let me spend far too much time on my
computer, either working, learning, writing or playing. You're also more than happy to read over my
stuff or listen to me blab on about nonsense. I don't appreciate you nearly as much as I should.

A

few years ago I was fortunate enough to turn a corner in my programming career. The
opportunity for solid mentoring presented itself, and I took full advantage of it. Within the space
of a few months, my programming skills grew exponentially and over the last couple years, I’ve
continued to refine my art. Doubtless I still have much to learn, and five years from now I’ll look back on
the code I write today and feel embarrassed. I used to be confident in my programming skill, but only
once I accepted that I knew very little, and likely always would, did I start to actually understand.
My Foundations of Programming series is a collection of posts which focus on helping enthusiastic
programmers help themselves. Throughout the series we’ll look at a number of topics typically
discussed in far too much depth to be of much use to anyone except those who already know about
them. I’ve always seen two dominant forces in the .NET world, one heavily driven by Microsoft as a
natural progression of VB6 and classic ASP (commonly referred to as The MSDN Way) and the other
heavily driven by core object oriented practices and influenced by some of the best Java
projects/concepts (known as ALT.NET).
In reality, the two aren’t really comparable. The MSDN Way loosely defines a specific way to build a
system down to each individual method call (after all, isn’t the API reference documentation the only
reason any of us visit MSDN?) Whereas ALT.NET focuses on more abstract topics while providing specific
implementation. As Jeremy Miller puts it: the .Net community has put too much focus on learning API
and framework details and not enough emphasis on design and coding fundamentals. For a relevant and
concrete example, The MSDN Way heavily favors the use of DataSets and DataTables for all database
communication. ALT.NET however, focuses on discussions about persistence design patterns, objectrelational impendence mismatch as well as specific implementations such as NHibernate (O/R Mapping),
MonoRail (ActiveRecord) as well as DataSets and DataTables. In other words, despite what many people
think, ALT.NET isn’t about ALTernatives to The MSDN Way, but rather a belief that developers should
know and understand alternative solutions and approaches of which The MSDN Way is part of.
Of course, it’s plain from the above description that going the ALT.NET route requires a far greater
commitment as well as a wider base of knowledge. The learning curve is steep and helpful resources are
just now starting to emerge (which is the reason I decided to start this series). However, the rewards are
worthwhile; for me, my professional success has resulted in greater personal happiness.

Goals
Although simplistic, every programming decision I make is largely based on maintainability.
Maintainability is the cornerstone of enterprise development. Frequent CodeBetter readers are likely
sick of hearing about it, but there's a good reason we talk about maintainability so often – it’s the key to
being a great software developer. I can think of a couple reasons why it’s such an important design
factor. First, both studies and firsthand experience tell us that systems spend a considerable amount of
time (over 50%) in a maintenance state - be it changes, bug fixes or support. Second, the growing
adoption of iterative development means that changes and features are continuously made to existing
code (and even if you haven’t adopted iterative development such as Agile, your clients are likely still
asking you to make all types of changes.) In short, a maintainable solution not only reduces your cost,
but also increases the number and quality of features you’ll be able to deliver.
Even if you're relatively new to programming, there's a good chance you've already started forming
opinions about what is and isn't maintainable from your experience working with others, taking over
someone's application, or even trying to fix something you wrote a couple months ago. One of the most
important things you can do is consciously take note when something doesn’t seem quite right and
google around for better solutions. For example, those of us who spent years programming in classicASP knew that the tight integration between code and HTML wasn't ideal.
Creating maintainable code isn’t the most trivial thing. As you get started, you’ll need to be extra
diligent until things start to become more natural. As you might have suspected, we aren’t the firsts to
put some thought into creating maintainable code. To this end, there are some sound ideologies you
ought to familiarize yourself with. As we go through them, take time to consider each one in depth,
google them for extra background and insight, and, most importantly, try to see how they might apply
to a recent project you worked on.

Simplicity
The ultimate tool in making your code maintainable is to keep it as simple as possible. A common belief
is that in order to be maintainable, a system needs to be engineered upfront to accommodate any
possible change request. I’ve seen systems built on meta-repositories (tables with a Key column and a
Value column), or complex XML configurations, that are meant to handle any changes a client might
throw at the team. Not only do these systems tend to have serious technical limitation (performance
can be orders of magnitude slower), but they almost always fail in what they set out to do (we’ll look at
this more when we talk about YAGNI). In my experience, the true path to flexibility is to keep a system
as simple as possible, so that you, or another developer, can easily read your code, understand it, and
make the necessary change. Why build a configurable rules engine when all you want to do is check that
a username is the correct length? In a later chapter, we’ll see how Test Driven Development can help us
achieve a high level of simplicity by making sure we focus on what our client is paying us to do.

YAGNI
You Aren’t Going to Need It is an Extreme Programming belief that you shouldn’t build something now
because you think you’re going to need it in the future. Experience tells us that you probably won’t
actually need it, or you’ll need something slightly different. You can spend a month building an

amazingly flexible system just to have a simple 2 line email from a client make it totally useless. Just the
other day I started working on an open-ended reporting engine to learn that I had misunderstood an
email and what the client really wanted was a single daily report that ended up taking 15 minutes to
build.

Last Responsible Moment
The idea behind Last Responsible Moment is that you defer building something until you absolutely have
to. Admittedly, in some cases, the latest responsible moment is very early on in the development phase.
This concept is tightly coupled with YAGNI, in that even if you really DO need it, you should still wait to
write it until you can’t wait any longer. This gives you, and your client, time to make sure you really DO
need it after all, and hopefully reduces the number of changes you’ll have to make while and after
development.

DRY
Code duplication can cause developers major headaches. They not only make it harder to change code
(because you have to find all the places that do the same thing), but also have the potential to introduce
serious bugs and make it unnecessarily hard for new developers to jump onboard. By following the
Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY) principal throughout the lifetime of a system (user stories, design, code,
unit tests and documentation) you’ll end up with cleaner and more maintainable code. Keep in mind
that the concept goes beyond copy-and-paste and aims at eliminating duplicate functionality/behavior
in all forms. Object encapsulation and highly cohesive code can help us reduce duplication.

Explicitness and Cohesion
It sounds straightforward, but it’s important to make sure that your code does exactly what it says it’s
going to do. This means that functions and variables should be named appropriately and using
standardized casing and, when necessary, adequate documentation be provided. A Producer class ought
to do exactly what you, other developers in the team and your client think it should. Additionally, you r
classes and methods should be highly cohesive – that is, they should have a singularity of purpose. If you
find yourself writing a Customer class which is starting to manage order data, there’s a good chance you
need to create an Order class. Classes responsible for a multitude of distinct components quickly
become unmanageable. In the next chapter, we’ll look at object oriented programming’s capabilities
when it comes to creating explicit and cohesive code.

Coupling
Coupling occurs when two classes depend on each other. When possible, you want to reduce coupling in
order to minimize the impact caused by changes, and increase your code’s testability. Reducing or even
removing coupling is actually easier than most people think; there are strategies and tool s to help you.
The trick is to be able to identify undesirable coupling. We’ll cover coupling, in detail, in a later chapter.

Unit Tests and Continuous Integration
Unit Testing and Continuous Integration (commonly referred to as CI) are yet another topic we have to
defer for a later time. There are two things that are important for you to know beforehand. First, both

are paramount in order to achieve our goal of highly maintainable code. Unit tests empower developers
with an unbelievable amount of confidence. The amount of refactoring and feature changes you’re
able/willing to make when you have safety net of hundreds or thousands of automated tests that
validate you haven’t broken anything is unbelievable. Secondly, if you aren’t willing to adopt, or at le ast
try, unit testing, you’re wasting your time reading this. Much of what we’ll cover is squarely aimed at
improving the testability of our code.

In This Chapter
Even though this chapter didn't have any code, we did managed to cover quite a few items. Since I want
this to be more hands-on than theoretical, we’ll dive head first into actual code from here on in.
Hopefully we’ve already managed to clear up some of the buzz words you’ve been hearing so much
about lately. The next couple chapters will lay the foundation for the rest of our work by covering OOP
and persistence at a high level. Until then, I hope you spend some time researching some of the key
words I’ve thrown around. Since your own experience is your best tool, think about your recent and
current projects and try to list things that didn’t work out well as well as those that did.

Domain Driven Design

2

WHAT IS DESIGN? IT'S WHERE YOU STAND WITH A FOOT IN TWO WORLDS - THE
WORLD OF TECHNOLOGY AND THE WORLD OF PEOPLE AND HUMAN PURPOSES - AND
YOU TRY TO BRING THE TWO TOGETHER. – MITCHELL KAPOR

I

t's predictable to start off by talking about domain driven design and object oriented programming.
At first I thought I could avoid the topic for at least a couple posts, but that would do both you and
me a great disservice. There are a limited number of practical ways to design the core of your
system. A very common approach for .NET developers is to use a data-centric model. There’s a good
chance that you’re already an expert with this approach – having mastered nested repeaters, the everuseful ItemDataBound event and skillfully navigating DataRelations. Another solution, which is the
norm for Java developers and quickly gaining speed in the .NET community, favors a domain-centric
approach.

Domain/Data Driven Design
What do I mean by data and domain-centric approaches? Data-centric generally means that you build
your system around your understanding of the data you’ll be interacting with. The typical approach is to
first model your database by creating all the tables, columns and foreign key relationships, and then
mimicking this in C#/VB.NET. The reason this is so popular amongst .NET developers is that Microsoft
spent a lot of time automating the mimicking process with DataAdapters, DataSets and
DataTables. We all know that given a table with data in it, we can have a website or windows
application up and running in less than 5 minutes with just a few lines of code. The focus is all about the
data – which in a lot of cases is actually a good idea. This approach is sometimes called data driven
development.
Domain-centric design or, as it’s more commonly called, domain driven design (DDD), focuses on the
problem domain as a whole – which not only includes the data, but also the behavior. So we not only
focus on the fact that an employee has a FirstName, but also on the fact that he or she can get a
Raise. The Problem Domain is just a fancy way of saying the business you’re building a system for. The
tool we use is object oriented programming (OOP) – and just because you’re using an object-oriented
language like C# or VB.NET doesn’t mean you’re necessarily doing OOP.
The above descriptions are somewhat misleading – it somehow implies that if you were using DataSets
you wouldn’t care about, or be able to provide, the behavior of giving employees a raise. Of course that
isn’t at all the case – in fact it’d be pretty trivial to do. A data-centric system isn’t void of behavior nor
does it treat them as an afterthought. DDD is simply better suited at handling complex systems in a
more maintainable way for a number of reasons – all of which we’ll cover in following chapters. This
doesn’t make domain driven better than data driven – it simply makes domain driven better than data
driven in some cases and the reverse is also true. You’ve probably read all of this before, and in the end,
you simply have to make a leap of faith and tentatively accept what we preach – at least enough so that
you can judge for yourself.

Chapter 2 - Domain Driven Design

12

(It may be crude and a little contradictory to what I said in my introduction, but the debate between The
MSDN Way and ALT.NET could be summed up as a battle between data driven and domain driven
design. True ALT.NETers though, ought to appreciate that data driven is indeed the right choice in some
situations. I think much of the hostility between the “camps” is that Microsoft disproportionately favors
data driven design despite the fact that it doesn’t fit well with what most .NET developers are doing
(enterprise development), and, when improperly used, results in less mai ntainable code. Many
programmers, both inside and outside the .NET community, are probably scratching their heads trying
to understand why Microsoft insists on going against conventional wisdom and clumsily having to
always catch-up.)

Users, Clients and Stakeholders
Something which I take very seriously from Agile
development is the close interaction the development team
has with clients and users. In fact, whenever possible, I
don’t see it as the development team and the client, but a
single entity: the team. Whether you’re fortunate enough or
not to be in such a situation (sometimes lawyers get in the
way, sometimes clients aren’t available for that much
commitment, etc.) it’s important to understand what
everyone brings to the table. The client is the person who
pays the bills and as such, should make the final decisions
about features and priorities. Users actually use the system.
Clients are oftentimes users, but rarely are they the only
user. A website for example might have anonymous users,
registered users, moderators and administrators. Finally,
stakeholders consist of anyone with a stake in the system.
The same website might have a sister or parent site,
advertisers, PR or domain experts.

In the past, I'd frequently get
pissed off with clients. They were
annoying, didn't know what they
wanted and always made the
wrong choice.
Once I actually thought about it
though, I realized that I wasn't
nearly as smart as I thought I was.
The client knew far more about his
or her business than I did. Not only
that, but it was their money and
my job was to make them get the
most out of it.
As the relationship turned more
collaborative and positive, not only
did the end result greatly improve,
but programming became fun
again.

Clients have a very hard job. They have to objectively
prioritize the features everyone wants, including their own
and deal with their finite budget. Obviously they’ll make
wrong choices, maybe because they don’t fully understand
a user’s need, maybe because you made a mistake in the
information you provided, or maybe because they improperly give higher priority to their own needs
over everyone else's. As a developer, it’s your job to help them out as much as possible and deliver on
their needs.

Whether you’re building a commercial system or not, the ultimate measure of its success will likely be
how users feel about it. So while you’re working closely with your client, hopefully both of you are
working towards your users needs. If you and your client are serious about building systems for users, I

strongly encourage you to read up on User Stories – a good place to start is Mike Cohn’s excellent User
Stories Applied1.
Finally, and the main reason this little section exists, are domain experts. Domain experts are the people
who know all the ins and outs about the world your system will live in. I was recently part of a very large
development project for a financial institute and there were literally hundreds of domain experts most
of which being economists or accountants. These are people who are as enthusiastic about what they do
as you are about programming. Anyone can be a domain expert – a clients, a user, a stakeholder and,
eventually, even you. Your reliance on domain experts grows with the complexity of a system.

The Domain Object
As I said earlier, object oriented programming is the tool we’ll use to make our domain-centric design
come to life. Specifically, we’ll rely on the power of classes and encapsulation. In this chapter we’ll focus
on the basics of classes and some tricks to get started – many developers will already know everything
covered here. We won’t cover persistence (talking to the database) just yet. If you’re new to this kind of
design, you might find yourself constantly wondering about the database and data access code. Try not
to worry about it too much. In the next chapter we’ll cover the basics of persistence, and in following
chapters, we’ll look at persistence in even greater depth.
The idea behind domain driven design is to build your system in a manner that’s reflecti ve of the actual
problem domain you are trying to solve. This is where domain experts come into play – they’ll help you
understand how the system currently works (even if it’s a manual paper process) and how it ought to
work. At first you’ll be overwhelmed by their knowledge – they’ll talk about things you’ve never heard
about and be surprised by your dumbfounded look. They’ll use so many acronyms and special words
that’ll you’ll begin to question whether or not you’re up to the task. Ultimately, this is the true purpose
of an enterprise developer – to understand the problem domain. You already know how to program, but
do you know how to program the specific inventory system you’re being asked to do? Someone has to
learn someone else’s world, and if domain experts learn to program, we’re all out of jobs.
Anyone who’s gone through the above knows that learning a new business is the most complicated part
of any programming job. For that reason, there are real benefits to making our code resemble, as much
as possible, the domain. Essentially what I’m talking about is communication. If your users are talking
about Strategic Outcomes, which a month ago meant nothing to you, and your code talks about
StrategicOutcomes then some of the ambiguity and much of the potential misinterpretation is
cleaned up. Many people, myself included, believe that a good place to start is with key noun-words
that your business experts and users use. If you were building a system for a car dealership and you
talked to a salesman (who is likely both a user and a domain expert), he’ll undoubtedly talk about
Clients, Cars, Models, Packages and Upgrades, Payments and so on. As these are the core of his
business, it’s logical that they be the core of your system. Beyond noun-words is the convergence on the
language of the business – which has come to be known as the ubiquitous language (ubiquitous means

present everywhere). The idea being that a single shared language between users and system is easier
to maintain and less likely to be misinterpreted.
Exactly how you start is really up to you. Doing domain driven design doesn’t necessarily mean you have
to start with modeling the domain (although it’s a good idea!), but rather it means that you should focus
on the domain and let it drive your decisions. At first you may very well start with your data model,
when we explore test driven development we’ll take a different approach to building a system that fits
very well with DDD. For now though, let’s assume we’ve spoken to our client and a few salespeople,
we’ve realized that a major pain-point is keeping track of the inter-dependency between upgrade
options. The first thing we’ll do is create four classes:
public
public
public
public

class
class
class
class

Car{}
Model{}
Package{}
Upgrade{}

Next we’ll add a bit of code based on some pretty safe assumptions:
public class Car
{
private Model _model;
private List<Upgrade> _upgrades;
public void Add(Upgrade upgrade){ //todo }
}
public class Model
{
private int _id;
private int _year;
private string _name;
public ReadOnlyCollection<Upgrade> GetAvailableUpgrades()
{
return null; //todo
}
}
public class Upgrade
{
private int _id;
private string _name;
public ReadOnlyCollection<Upgrade> RequiredUpgrades
{
get { return null; //todo }
}
}

Foundations of Programming

Chapter 2 - Domain Driven Design

15

Things are quite simple. We’ve added some pretty traditional fields (id, name), some references (both
Cars and Models have Upgrades), and an Add function to the Car class. Now we can make slight
modifications and start writing a bit of actual behavior.
public class Car
{
private Model _model;
//todo where to initialize this?
private List<Upgrade> _upgrades;
public void Add(Upgrade upgrade)
{
_upgrades.Add(upgrade);
}
public ReadOnlyCollection<Upgrade> MissingUpgradeDependencies()
{
List<Upgrade> missingUpgrades = new List<Upgrade>();
foreach (Upgrade upgrade in _upgrades)
{
foreach (Upgrade dependentUpgrade in upgrade.RequiredUpgrades)
{
if (!_upgrades.Contains(dependentUpgrade)
&& !missingUpgrades.Contains(dependentUpgrade))
{
missingUpgrades.Add(dependentUpgrade);
}
}
}
return missingUpgrades.AsReadOnly();
}
}

First, we’ve implemented the Add method. Next we’ve implemented a method that lets us retrieve all
missing upgrades. Again, this is just a first step; the next step could be to track which upgrades are
responsible for causing missing upgrades, i.e. You must select 4 Wheel Drive to go with your Traction
Control; however, we’ll stop for now. The purpose was just to highlight how we might get started and
what that start might look like.

UI
You might have noticed that we haven’t talked about UIs yet. That’s because our domain is independent
of the presentation layer – it can be used to power a website, a windows application or a windows
service. The last thing you want to do is intermix your presentation and domain logic. Doing so won’t
only result in hard-to-change and hard-to-test code, but it’ll also make it impossible to re-use our logic
across multiple UIs (which might not be a concern, but readability and maintainability always is). Sadly
though, that’s exactly what many ASP.NET developers do – intermix their UI and domain layer. I’d even
say it’s common to see behavior throughout ASP.NET button click handlers and page load events. The
ASP.NET page framework is meant to control the ASP.NET UI – not to implement behavior. The click
event of the Save button shouldn’t validate complex business rules (or worse, hit the database directly),

rather its purpose is to modify the ASP.NET page based on the results on the domain layer – maybe it
ought to redirect to another page, display some error messages or request additional information.
Remember, you want to write cohesive code. Your ASP.NET logic should focus on doing one thing and
doing it well – I doubt anyone will disagree that it has to manage the page, which means it can’t do
domain functionality. Also, logic placed in codebehind will typically violate the Don’t Repeat Yourself
principal, simply because of how difficult it is to reuse the code inside an aspx.cs file.
With that said, you can’t wait too long to start working on your UI. First of all, we want to get client and
user feedback as early and often as possible. I doubt they’ll be very impressed if we send them a bunch
of .cs/.vb files with our classes. Secondly, making actual use of your domain layer is going to reveal some
flaws and awkwardness. For example, the disconnected nature of the web might mean we have to make
little changes to our pure OO world in order to achieve a better user experience. In my experience, unit
tests are too narrow to catch these quirks.
You’ll also be happy to know that ASP.NET and WinForms deal with domain-centric code just as well as
with data-centric classes. You can databind to any .NET collection, use sessions and caches like you
normally do, and anything else you’re used to doing. In fact, out of everything, the impact on the UI is
probably the least significant. Of course, it shouldn’t surprise you to know that ALT.NET’ers also think
you should keep your mind open when it comes to your presentation engine. The ASP.NET Page
Framework isn’t necessarily the best tool for the job – a lot of us consider it unnecessarily complicated
and brittle. We’ll talk about this more in a later chapter, but if you’re interested to find out more, I
suggest you look at MonoRails (which is a Rails framework for .NET) or the recently released MVC
framework by Microsoft. The last thing I want is for anyone to get discouraged with the vastness of
changes, so for now, let’s get back on topic.

Tricks and Tips
We’ll finish off this chapter by looking at some useful things we can do with classes. We’ll only cover the
tip of the iceberg, but hopefully the information will help you get off on the right foot.
Factory Pattern
What do we do when a Client buys a new Car? Obviously we need to create a new instance of Car and
specify the model. The traditional way to do this is to use a constructor and simply instantiate a new
object with the new keyword. A different approach is to use a factory to create the instance:
public class Car
{
private Model _model;
private List<Upgrade> _upgrades;
private Car()
{
_upgrades = new List<Upgrade>();
}
public static Car CreateCar(Model model)
{

Chapter 2 - Domain Driven Design

17

Car car = new Car();
car._model = model;
return car;
}
}

There are two advantages to this approach. Firstly, we can return a null object, which is impossible to do
with a constructor – this may or may not be useful in your particular case. Secondly, if there are a lot of
different ways to create an object, it gives you the chance to provide more meaningful function names.
The first example that comes to mind is when you want to create an instance of a User class, you’ll
likely have User.CreateByCredentials(string username, string password) ,
User.CreateById(int id) and User.GetUsersByRole(string role) . You can accomplish the
same functionality with constructor overloading, but rarely with the same clarity. Truth be told, I always
have a hard time deciding which to use, so it’s really a matter of taste and gut feeling.
Access Modifiers
As you focus on writing classes that encapsulate the behavior of the business, a rich API is going to
emerge for your UI to consume. It’s a good idea to keep this API clean and understandable. The simplest
method is to keep your API small by hiding all but the most necessary methods. Some methods clearly
need to be public and others private, but if ever you aren’t sure, pick a more restrictive access
modifier and only change it when necessary. I make good use of the internal modifier on many of my
methods and properties. Internal members are only visible to other members within the same assembly
– so if you’re physically separating your layers across multiple assemblies (which is generally a good
idea), you’ll greatly minimize your API.
Interfaces
Interfaces will play a big part in helping us create maintainable code. We’ll use them to decouple our
code as well as create mock classes for unit testing. An interface is a contract which any implementing
classes must adhere to. Let’s say that we want to encapsulate all our database communication inside a
class called SqlServerDataAccess such as:
internal class SqlServerDataAccess
{
internal List<Upgrade> RetrieveAllUpgrades()
{
return null; //todo implement
}
}
public void ASampleMethod()
{
SqlServerDataAccess da = new SqlServerDataAccess();
List<Upgrade> upgrades = da.RetrieveAllUpgrades();
}

Chapter 2 - Domain Driven Design

18

You can see that the sample code at the bottom has a direct reference to SqlServerDataAccess – as
would the many other methods that need to communicate with the database. Thi s highly coupled code
is problematic to change and difficult to test (we can’t test ASampleMethod without having a fully
functional RetrieveAllUpgrades method). We can relieve this tight coupling by programming against
an interface instead:
internal interface IDataAccess
{
List<Upgrade> RetrieveAllUpgrades();
}
internal class DataAccess
{
internal static IDataAccess CreateInstance()
{
return new SqlServerDataAccess();
}
}
internal class SqlServerDataAccess : IDataAccess
{
public List<Upgrade> RetrieveAllUpgrades()
{
return null; //todo implement
}
}
public void ASampleMethod()
{
IDataAccess da = DataAccess.CreateInstance();
List<Upgrade> upgrades = da.RetrieveAllUpgrades();
}

We’ve introduced the interface along with a helper class to return an instance of that interface. If we
want to change our implementation, say to an OracleDataAccess, we simply create the new Oracle
class, make sure it implements the interface, and change the helper class to return it instead. Rather
than having to change multiple (possibly hundreds), we simply have to change one.
This is only a simple example of how we can use interfaces to help our cause. We can beef up the code
by dynamically instantiating our class via configuration data or introducing a framework specially
tailored for the job (which is exactly what we’re going to do). We’ll often favor programming against
interfaces over actual classes, so if you aren’t familiar with them, I’d suggest you do some extra reading.
Information Hiding and Encapsulation
Information hiding is the principle that design decisions should be hidden from other components of
your system. It’s generally a good idea to be as secretive as possible when building classes and
components so that changes to implementation don’t impact other classes and components.
Encapsulation is an OOP implementation of information hiding. Essentially it means that your object's
data (the fields) and as much as the implementation should not be accessible to other classes. The most

common example is making fields private with public properties. Even better is to ask yourself if the _id
field even needs a public property to begin with.

In This Chapter
The reason enterprise development exists is that no single off-the-shelf product can successfully solve
the needs of a complex system. There are simply too many odd or intertwined requirements and
business rules. To date, no paradigm has been better suited to the task than object oriented
programming. In fact, OOP was designed with the specific purpose of letting developers model real life
things. It may still be difficult to see the long-term value of domain driven design. Sharing a common
language with your client and users in addition to having greater testability may not seem necessary.
Hopefully as you go through the remaining chapters and experiment on your own, you’ll start adopting
some of the concepts and tweaking them to fit yours and your clients needs.

CODD'S AIM WAS TO FREE PROGRAMMERS FROM HAVING TO KNOW THE PHYSICAL
STRUCTURE OF DATA. O UR AIM IS TO FREE THEM IN ADDITION FROM HAVING TO
KNOW ITS LOGICAL STRUCTURE. – LAZY SOFTWARE

I

n the previous chapter we managed to have a good discussion about DDD without talking much
about databases. If you’re used to programming with DataSets, you probably have a lot of
questions about how this is actually going to work. DataSets are great in that a lot is taken care of
for you. In this chapter we’ll start the discussion around how to deal with persistence using DDD. We’ll
manually write code to bridge the gap between our C# objects and our SQL tables. In later sections we
will look at more advanced alternatives (two different O/R mapping approaches) which, like DataSets,
do much of the heavy lifting for us. This chapter is meant to bring some closure to the previous
discussion while opening the discussion on more advanced persiste nce patterns.

The Gap
As you know, your program runs in memory and requires a place to store (or persist) information. These
days, the solution of choice is a relational database. Persistence is actually a pretty big topic in the
software development field because, without the help of patterns and tools, it isn’t the easiest thing to
successfully pull off. With respect to object oriented programming, the challenge has been given a fancy
name: the Object-Relational Impedance Mismatch. That pretty much means that relational data doesn’t
map perfectly to objects and objects don’t map perfectly to relational stores. Microsoft basically tried to
ignore this problem and simply made a relational representation within object-oriented code – a clever
approach, but not without its flaws such as poor performance, leaky abstractions, poor testability,
awkwardness, and poor maintainability. (On the other side are object oriented databases which, to the
best of my knowledge, haven’t taken off either.)
Rather than try to ignore the problem, we can, and should face it head on. We should face it so that we
can leverage the best of both worlds – complex business rules implemented in OOP and data storage
and retrieval via relational databases. Of course, that is providing that we can bridge the gap. But what
gap exactly? What is this Impedance Mismatch? You’re probably thinking that it can’t be that hard to
pump relational data into objects and back into tables. If you are, then you’re absolutely right (mostly
right anyways…for now let’s assume that it’s always a simple process).

DataMapper
For small projects with only a handful of small domain classes and database tables, my preference has
generally been to manually write code that maps between the two worlds. Let’s look at a simple
example. The first thing we’ll do is expand on our Upgrade class (we’re only focusing on the data
portions of our class (the fields) since that’s what gets persisted):

public class Upgrade
{
private int _id;
private string _name;
private string _description;
private decimal _price;
private List<Upgrade> _requiredUpgrades;
public int Id
{
get { return _id; }
internal set { _id = value; }
}
public string Name
{
get { return _name; }
set { _name = value; }
}
public string Description
{
get { return _description; }
set { _description = value; }
}
public decimal Price
{
get { return _price; }
set { _price = value; }
}
public List<Upgrade> RequiredUpgrades
{
get { return _requiredUpgrades; }
}
}

We’ve added the basic fields you’d likely expect to see in the class. Next we’ll create the table that
would hold, or persist, the upgrade information.
CREATE TABLE Upgrades
(
Id INT IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
[Name] VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
Description VARCHAR(512) NOT NULL,
Price MONEY NOT NULL,
)

No surprises there. Now comes the interesting part (well, relatively speaking), we’ll start to build up our
data access layer, which sits between the domain and relational models (interfaces left out for brevity)

internal class SqlServerDataAccess
{
private readonly static string _connectionString = "FROM_CONFIG"
internal List<Upgrade> RetrieveAllUpgrades()
{
//use a sproc if you prefer
string sql = "SELECT Id, Name, Description, Price FROM Upgrades";
using (SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand(sql))
using (SqlDataReader dataReader = ExecuteReader(command))
{
List<Upgrade> upgrades = new List<Upgrade>();
while (dataReader.Read())
{
upgrades.Add(DataMapper.CreateUpgrade(dataReader));
}
return upgrades;
}
}

private SqlDataReader ExecuteReader(SqlCommand command)
{
SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(_connectionString);
command.Connection = connection;
connection.Open();
return command.ExecuteReader(CommandBehavior.CloseConnection)
}
}

ExecuteReader is a helper method to slightly reduce the redundant code we have to write.

RetrieveAllUpgrades is more interesting as it selects all the upgrades and loads them into a list via the
DataMapper.CreateUpgrade function. CreateUpgrade, shown below, is the reusable code we use
to map upgrade information stored in the database into our domain. It’s straightforward because the
domain model and data model are so similar.
internal static class DataMapper
{
internal static Upgrade CreateUpgrade(IDataReader dataReader)
{
Upgrade upgrade = new Upgrade();
upgrade.Id = Convert.ToInt32(dataReader["Id"]);
upgrade.Name = Convert.ToString(dataReader["Name"]);
upgrade.Description = Convert.ToString(dataReader["Description"]);
upgrade.Price = Convert.ToDecimal(dataReader["Price"]);
return upgrade;
}
}

23

If we need to, we can re-use CreateUpgrade as much as necessary. For example, we’d likely need the
ability to retrieve upgrades by id or price – both of which would be new methods in the
SqlServerDataAccess class.
Obviously, we can apply the same logic when we want to store Upgrade objects back into the store.
Here’s one possible solution:
internal static SqlParameter[] ConvertUpgradeToParameters(Upgrade upgrade)
{
SqlParameter[] parameters = new SqlParameter[4];
parameters[0] = new SqlParameter("Id", SqlDbType.Int);
parameters[0].Value = upgrade.Id;
parameters[1] = new SqlParameter("Name", SqlDbType.VarChar, 64);
parameters[1].Value = upgrade.Name;
parameters[2] = new SqlParameter("Description", SqlDbType.VarChar, 512);
parameters[2].Value = upgrade.Description;
parameters[3] = new SqlParameter("Price", SqlDbType.Money);
parameters[3].Value = upgrade.Price;
return parameters;
}

We have a problem
Despite the fact that we’ve taken a very simple and common example, we still ran into the dreaded
impedance mismatch. Notice how our data access layer (either the SqlServerDataAccess or
DataMapper) doesn’t handle the much needed RequiredUpgrades collection. That’s because one of
the trickiest things to handle are relationships. In the domain world these are references (or a collection
of references) to other objects; whereas the relational world uses foreign keys. This difference is a
constant thorn in the side of developers. The fix isn’t too hard. First we’ll add a many-to-many join table
which associates an upgrade with the other upgrades that are required for it (could be 0, 1 or more).
CREATE TABLE UpgradeDepencies
(
UpgradeId INT NOT NULL,
RequiredUpgradeId INT NOT NULL,
)

Next we modify RetrieveAllUpgrade to load-in required upgrades:

24

internal List<Upgrade> RetrieveAllUpgrades()
{
string sql = @"SELECT Id, Name, Description, Price FROM Upgrades;
SELECT UpgradeId, RequiredUpgradeId FROM UpgradeDepencies";
using (SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand(sql))
using (SqlDataReader dataReader = ExecuteReader(command))
{
List<Upgrade> upgrades = new List<Upgrade>();
Dictionary<int, Upgrade> localCache = new Dictionary<int, Upgrade>();
while (dataReader.Read())
{
Upgrade upgrade = DataMapper.CreateUpgrade(dataReader);
upgrades.Add(upgrade);
localCache.Add(upgrade.Id, upgrade);
}
dataReader.NextResult();
while (dataReader.Read())
{
int upgradeId = dataReader.GetInt32(0);
int requiredUpgradeId = dataReader.GetInt32(1);
Upgrade upgrade;
Upgrade required;
if (!localCache.TryGetValue(upgradeId, out upgrade)
|| !localCache.TryGetValue(requiredUpgradeId, out required))
{
//probably should throw an exception
//since our db is in a weird state
continue;
}
upgrade.RequiredUpgrades.Add(requiredUpgrade);
}
return upgrades;
}
}

We pull the extra join table information along with our initial query and create a local lookup dictionary
to quickly access our upgrades by their id. Next we loop through the join table, get the appropriate
upgrades from the lookup dictionary and add them to the collections.
It isn’t the most elegant solution, but it works rather well. We may be able to refactor the function a bit
to make it little more readable, but for now and for this simple case, it’ll do the job.
Limitations
Although we’re only doing an initial look at mapping, it’s worth it to look at the limitations we’ve placed
on ourselves. Once you go down the path of manually writing this kind of code it can quickly get out of
hand. If we want to add filtering/sorting methods we either have to write dynamic SQL or have to write
a lot of methods. We’ll end up writing a bunch of RetrieveUpgradeByX methods that’ll be painfully
similar from one to another.

25

Oftentimes you’ll want to lazy-load relationships. That is, instead of loading all the required upgrades
upfront, maybe we want to load them only when necessary. In this case it isn’t a big deal since it’s just
an extra 32bit reference. A better example would be the Model’s relationship to Upgrades. It is
relatively easy to implement lazy loads, it’s just, yet again, a lot of repetitive code.
The most significant issue though has to do with identity. If we call RetrieveAllUpgrades twice, we’ll
get to distinct instances of every upgrade. This can result in inconsistencies, given:
SqlServerDataAccess da = new SqlServerDataAccess();
Upgrade upgrade1a = da.RetrieveAllUpgrades()[0];
Upgrade upgrade1b = da.RetrieveAllUpgrades()[0];
upgrade1b.Price = 2000;
upgrade1b.Save();

The price change to the first upgrade won’t be reflected in the instance pointed to by upgrade1a. In
some cases that won’t be a problem. However, in many situations, you’ll want your data access layer to
track the identity of instances it creates and enforce some control (you can read more by googling the
Identify Map pattern).
There are probably more limitations, but the last one we’ll talk about has to do with units of work
(again, you can read more by googling the Unit of Work pattern). Essentially when you manually code
your data access layer, you need to make sure that when you persist an object, you also persist, if
necessary, updated referenced objects. If you’re working on the admin portion of our car sales system,
you might very well create a new Model and add a new Upgrade. If you call Save on your Model, you
need to make sure your Upgrade is also saved. The simplest solution is to call save often for each
individual action – but this is both difficult (relationships can be several levels deep) and inefficient.
Similarly you may change only a few properties and then have to decide between resaving all fields, or
somehow tracking changed properties and only updating those. Again, for small systems, this isn’t much
of a problem. For larger systems, it’s a near impossible task to manually do (besides, rather than wasting
your time building your own unit of work implementation, maybe you should be writing functionality
the client asked for).

In This Chapter
In the end, we won’t rely on manual mapping – it just isn’t flexible enough and we end up spending too
much time writing code that’s useless to our client. Nevertheless, it’s important to see mapping in action
– and even though we picked a simple example, we still ran into some issues. Since mapping like this is
straightforward, the most important thing is that you understand the limitations this approach has. Try
thinking what can happen if two distinct instances of the same data are floating around in your code, or
just how quickly your data access layer will balloon as new requirements come in. We won’t revisit
persistence for at least a couple chapters – but when we do re-address it we’ll examine full-blown
solutions that pack quite a punch.

t’s common to hear developers promote layering as a means to provide extensibility. The most
common example, and one I used in Chapter 2 when we looked at interfaces, is the ability to switch
out your data access layer in order to connect to a different database. If your projects are anything
like mine, you know upfront what database you’re going to use and you know you aren’t going to have
to change it. Sure, you could build that flexibility upfront - just in case - but what about keeping things
simple and You Aren’t Going To Need IT (YAGNI)?
I used to write about the importance of domain layers in order to have re-use across multiple
presentation layers: website, windows applications and web services. Ironicall y, I’ve rarely had to write
multiple front-ends for a given domain layer. I still think layering is important, but my reasoning has
changed. I now see layering as a natural by-product of highly cohesive code with at least some thought
put into coupling. That is, if you build things right, it should automatically come out layered.
The real reason we’re spending a whole chapter on decoupling (which layering is a high-level
implementation of) is because it’s a key ingredient in writing testable code. It wasn’t until I started unit
testing that I realized how tangled and fragile my code was. I quickly became frustrated because method
X relied on a function in class Y which needed a database up and running. In order to avoid the
headaches I went through, we’ll first cover coupling and then look at unit testing in the next chapter.
(A point about YAGNI. While many developers consider it a hard rule, I rather think of it as a general
guideline. There are good reasons why you want to ignore YAGNI, the most obvious i s your own
experience. If you know that something will be hard to implement later, it might be a good idea to build
it now, or at least put hooks in place. This is something I frequently do with caching, building an
ICacheProvider and a NullCacheProvider implementation that does nothing, except provide the
necessary hooks for a real implementation later on. That said, of the numerous guidelines out there,
YAGNI, DRY and Sustainable Pace are easily the three I consider the most important.)

Sneak Peak at Unit Testing
Talking about coupling with respect to unit testing is something of a chicken and egg problem – which to
talk about first. I think it’s best to move ahead with coupling, provided we cover some basics about unit
testing. Most importantly is that unit tests are all about the unit. You aren’t focusing on end-to-end
testing but rather on individual behavior. The idea is that if you test each behavior of each method
thoroughly and test their interaction with one another, you’re whole system is solid. This is tricky given
that the method you want to unit test might have a dependency on another class which can’t be easily
executed within the context of a test (such as a database, or a web-browser element). For this reason,
unit testing makes use of mock classes – or pretend class.
Let’s look at an example, saving a car’s state:
public class Car
{
private int _id;
public void Save()
{
if (!IsValid())
{
//todo: come up with a better exception
throw new InvalidOperationException("The car must be in a valid
state");
}
if (_id == 0)
{
_id = DataAccess.CreateInstance().Save(this);
}
else
{
DataAccess.CreateInstance().Update(this);
}
}
private bool IsValid()
{
//todo: make sure the object is in a valid state
return true;
}
}

To effectively test the Save method, there are three things we must do:
1. Make sure the correct exception is thrown when we try to save a car which is in an invalid state,
2. Make sure the data access’ Save method is called when it’s a new car, and
3. Make sure the Update method is called when it’s an existing car.
What we don’t want to do (which is just as important as what we do want to do), is test the functionality
of IsValid or the data access’ Save and Update functions (other tests will take care of those). The last
point is important – all we want to do is make sure these functions are called with the proper

parameters and their return value (if any) is properly handled. It’s hard to wrap your head around
mocking without a concrete example, but mocking frameworks will let us intercept the Save and
Update calls, ensure that the proper arguments were passed, and force whatever return value we want.
Mocking frameworks are quite fun and effective....unless you can’t use them because your code is
tightly coupled.

Don’t avoid Coupling like the Plague
In case you forgot from Chapter 1, coupling is simply what we call it when one class requires another
class in order to function. It’s essentially a dependency. All but the most basic lines of code are
dependent on other classes. Heck, if you write string site = “CodeBetter”, you’re coupled to the
System.String class – if it changes, your code could very well break. Of course the first thing you
need to know is that in the vast majority of cases, such as the silly string example, coupling isn’t a bad
thing. We don’t want to create interfaces and providers for
each and every one of our classes. It’s ok for our Car class to

Since it’s always a good idea to decouple your database from
your domain, we’ll use that as the example throughout this
chapter.

Dependency Injection

In Chapter 2 we saw how interfaces can help our cause –
however, the code provided didn’t allow us to dynamically
provide a mock implementation of IDataAccess for the
DataAccess factory class to return. In order to achieve this,
we’ll rely on a pattern called Dependency Injection (DI). DI is
specifically tailored for the situation because, as the name
implies, it’s a pattern that turns a hard-coded dependency into something that can be injected at
runtime. We’ll look at two forms of DI, one which we manually do, and the other which leverages a third
party library.
Constructor Injection
The simplest form of DI is constructor injection – that is, injecting dependencies via a class’ constructor.
First, let’s look at our DataAccess interface again and create a fake (or mock) implementation (don’t

worry, you won’t actually have to create mock implementations of each component, but for now it
keeps things obvious):
internal interface IDataAccess
{
int Save(Car car);
void Update(Car car);
}

internal class MockDataAccess : IDataAccess
{
private readonly List<Car> _cars = new List<Car>();
public int Save(Car car)
{
_cars.Add(car);
return _cars.Count;
}
public void Update(Car car)
{
_cars[_cars.IndexOf(car)] = car;
}
}

Although our mock’s upgrade function could probably be improved, it’ll do for now. Armed with this
fake class, only a minor change to the Car class is required:
public class Car
{
private int _id;
private IDataAccess _dataProvider;
public Car() : this(new SqlServerDataAccess())
{
}
internal Car(IDataAccess dataProvider)
{
_dataProvider = dataProvider;
}
public void Save()
{
if (!IsValid())
{
//todo: come up with a better exception
throw new InvalidOperationException("The car must be in a valid
state");
}
if (_id == 0)
{

Chapter 4 - Dependency Injection

30

_id = _dataProvider.Save(this);
}
else
{
_dataProvider.Update(this);
}
}
}

Take a good look at the code above and follow it through. Notice the clever use of constructor
overloading means that the introduction of DI doesn’t have any impact on existing code – if you choose
not to inject an instance of IDataAccess, the default implementation is used for you. On the flip side,
if we do want to inject a specific implementation, such as a MockDataAccess instance, we can:
public void AlmostATest()
{
Car car = new Car(new MockDataAccess());
car.Save();
if (car.Id != 1)
{
//something went wrong
}
}

There are minor variations available – we could have injected an IDataAccess directly in the Save
method or could set the private _dataAccess field via an internal property – which you use is mostly a
matter of taste.
Frameworks
Doing DI manually works great in simple cases, but can become unruly in more complex situations. A
recent project I worked on had a number of core components that needed to be injected – one for
caching, one for logging, one for a database access and another for a web service. Classes got polluted
with multiple constructor overloads and too much thought had to go into setting up classes for unit
testing. Since DI is so critical to unit testing, and most unit testers love their open-source tools, it should
come as no surprise that a number of frameworks exist to help automate DI. The rest of this chapter will
focus on StructureMap, an open source Dependency Injection framework created by fellow CodeBetter
blogger Jeremy Miller. (http://structuremap.sourceforge.net/)
Before using StructureMap you must configure it using an XML file (called StructureMap.config) or by
adding attributes to your classes. The configuration essentially says this is the interface I w ant to
program against and here’s the default implementation. The simplest of configurations to get
StructureMap up and running would look something like:

<StructureMap>
<DefaultInstance
PluginType="CodeBetter.Foundations.IDataAccess, CodeBetter.Foundations"
PluggedType="CodeBetter.Foundations.SqlDataAccess, CodeBetter.Foundations"/>
</StructureMap>

While I don’t want to spend too much time talking about configuration, it’s important to note that the
XML file must be deployed in the /bin folder of your application. You can automate this in VS.NET by
selecting the files, going to the properties and setting the Copy To Ouput Directory attribute to Copy
Always. (There are a variety of more advanced configuration options available. If you’re interested in
learning more, I suggest the StructureMap website).
Once configured, we can undo all the changes we made to the Car class to allow constructor injection
(remove the _dataProvider field, and the constructors). To get the correct IDataAccess
implementation, we simply need to ask StructureMap for it, the Save method now looks like:
public class Car
{
private int _id;
public void Save()
{
if (!IsValid())
{
//todo: come up with a better exception
throw new InvalidOperationException("The car must be in a valid
state");
}
IDataAccess dataAccess = ObjectFactory.GetInstance<IDataAccess>();
if (_id == 0)
{
_id = dataAccess.Save(this);
}
else
{
dataAccess.Update(this);
}
}
}

Chapter 4 - Dependency Injection

32

To use a mock rather than the default implementation, we simply need to inject the mock into
StructureMap:
public void AlmostATest()
{
ObjectFactory.InjectStub(typeof(IDataAccess), new MockDataAccess());
Car car = new Car();
car.Save();
if (car.Id != 1)
{
//something went wrong
}
ObjectFactory.ResetDefaults();
}

We use InjectStub so that subsequent calls to GetInstance return our mock, and make sure to
reset everything to normal via ResetDefaults.
DI frameworks such as StructureMap are as easy to use as they are useful. With a couple lines of
configuration and some minor changes to our code, we’ve greatly decreased our coupling which has
increased our testability. In the past, I’ve introduced StructureMap into existing large codebases in a
matter of minutes – the impact is minor.
A Final Improvement
With the introduction of the IDataAccess class as well as the use of our DI framework, we've managed
to remove much of the bad coupling present in our simple example. We could probably take it a couple
steps further, even to a point where it might do more harm than good. There is however one last
dependency that I'd like to hide away - our business objects are probably better off not knowing about
our specific DI implementation. Rather than calling StructureMap's ObjectFactory directly, we'll add
one more level of indirection:
public static class DataFactory
{
public static IDataAccess CreateInstance
{
get
{
return ObjectFactory.GetInstance<IDataAccess>();
}
}
}

Again, thanks to a simple change, we're able to make massive changes (choosing a different DI
framework) well into the development of our application with ease.

In This Chapter
Reducing coupling is one of those things that’s pretty easy to do yet yields great results towards our
quest for greater maintainability. All that’s required is a bit of knowledge and discipline – and of course,
tools don’t hurt either. It should be obvious why you want to decrease the dependency between the
components of your code – especially between those components that are responsible for different
aspects of the system (UI, Domain and Data being the obvious three). In the next chapter we’ll look at
unit testing which will really leverage the benefits of dependency injection. If you’re having problems
wrapping your head around DI, take a look at my more detailed article on the subject located on
DotNetSlackers.

WE CHOOSE NOT TO DO U NIT T ESTING SINCE IT GIVES US HIGHER PROFIT NOT TO!
- (RANDOM CONSULTANCY COMPANY)

T

hroughout this book we’ve talked about the importance of testability and we've looked at
techniques to make it easier to test our system. It goes without saying that a major benefit of
writing tests for our system is the ability to deliver a better product to our client. Although this is
true for unit tests as well, the main reason I write unit tests is that nothing comes close to improving the
maintainability of a system as much as a properly developed suite of unit tests. You’ll often hear unit
testing advocates speak of how much confidence unit tests give them – and that’s what it’s really all
about. On a project I’m currently working on, we’re continuously making changes and tweaks to
improve the system (functional improvements, performance, refactoring, you name it). Being that it’s a
fairly large system, we’re sometimes asked to make a change that ought to flat out scares us. Is it
doable? Will it have some weird side effect? What bugs will be introduced? Without unit tests, we’d
likely refuse to make the higher risk changes. But we know, and our client knows, that it’s the high risk
changes that have the most potential for success. It turns out that having 700+ unit tests which run
within a couple minutes lets us rip components apart, reorganize code, and build features we never
thought about a year ago, without worrying too much about it. Because we are confident in the
completeness of the unit tests, we know that we aren’t likely to introduce bugs into our production
environment – our changes might still cause bugs but we’ll know about them right away.
Unit tests aren’t only about mitigating high-risk changes. In my programming life, I’ve been responsible
for major bugs caused from seemingly low-risk changes as well. The point is that I can make a
fundamental or minor change to our system, right click the solution, select “Run Tests” and within 2
minutes know where we stand.
I simply can't stress how important unit tests are. Sure they're helpful in finding bugs and validating that
my code does what it should, but far more important is their seemingly magical ability to uncover fatal
flaws, or priceless gems in the design of a system. I get excited whenever I run across a method or
behavior which is mind-blowingly difficult to test. It means I've likely found a flaw in a fundamental part
of the system which likely would have gone unnoticed until some unforeseen change was asked for.
Similarly, whenever I put together a test in a couple seconds for something which I was pretty sure was
going to be difficult, I know someone on the team wrote code that'll be reusable in other projects.

Why Wasn't I Unit Testing 3 Years Ago?
For those of us who’ve discovered the joy of unit testing, it’s hard to understand why everyone isn’t
doing it. For those who haven’t adopted it, you probably wish we’d shut up about it already. For many
years I’d read blogs and speak to colleagues who were really into unit testing, but didn’t practice myself.
Looking back, here’s why it took me a while to get on the bandwagon:
1. I had misconception about the goals of unit testing. As I’ve already said, unit testing does
improve the quality of a system, but it’s really all about making it easier to change / maintain the
system later on. Furthermore, if you go to the next logical step and adopt Test Driven
Development, unit testing really becomes about design. To paraphrase Scott Bellware, TDD isn't
about testing because you're not thinking as a tester when doing TDD – you’re thinking as a
designer.
2. Like many, I used to think developers shouldn’t write tests! I don’t know the history behind this
belief, but I now think this is just an excuse used by bad programmers. Testing is the process of
both finding bugs in a system as well as validating that it works as expected. Maybe developers
aren’t good at finding bugs in their own code, but they are the best suited to make sure it works
the way they intended it to (and clients are best suited to test that it works like it should (if
you’re interested to find out more about that, I suggest you research Acceptance Testing and
FitNess ). Even though unit testing isn’t all that much about testing, developers who don’t
believe they should test their own code simply aren’t accountable.
3. Testing isn’t fun. Sitting in front of a monitor, inputting data and making sure everything’s ok
sucks. But unit testing is coding, which means there are a lot of challenges and metrics to gauge
your success. Sometimes, like coding, it’s a little mundane, but all in all it’s no different than the
other programming you do every day.
4. It takes time. Advocates will tell you that unit testing doesn’t take time, it SAVES time. This is
true in that the time you spend writing unit tests is likely to be small compared to the time you
save on change requests and bug fixes. That’s a little too Ivory Tower for me. In all honesty, unit
testing DOES take a lot of time (especially when you just start out). You may very well not have
enough time to unit test or your client might not feel the upfront cost is justified. In these
situations I suggest you identify the most critical code and test it as thoroughly as possible –
even a couple hours spent writing unit tests can have a big impact.
Ultimately, unit testing seemed like a complicated and mysterious thing that was only used in edge
cases. The benefits seemed unattainable and timelines didn’t seem to allow for it anyways. It turns out it
took a lot of practice (I had a hard time learning what to unit test and how to go about it), but the
benefits were almost immediately noticeable.

The Tools
With StructureMap already in place from the last chapter, we need only add 2 frameworks and 1 tool to
our unit testing framework: nUnit, RhinoMocks and TestDriven.NET.
TestDriven.NET is an add-on for Visual Studio that basically adds a “Run Test” option to our context
(right-click) menu but we won’t spend any time talking about it. The personal license of TestDriven.NET
is only valid for open source and trial users. However don’t worry too much if the licensing doesn’t suite
you, nUnit has its own test runner tool, just not integrated in VS.NET. (Resharper – users can also use its
built-in functionality).
nUnit is the testing framework we’ll actually use. There are alternatives, such as mbUnit, but I don’t
know nearly as much about them as I ought to.
RhinoMocks is the mocking framework we’ll use. In the last part we manually created our mock – which
was both rather limited and time consuming. RhinoMocks will automatically generate a mock class from
an interface and allow us to verify and control the interaction with it.
nUnit
The first thing to do is to add a reference to the nunit.framework.dll and the Rhino.Mocks.dll.
My own preference is to put my unit tests into their own assembly. For example, if my domain layer was
located in CodeBetter.Foundations, I’d likely create a new assembly called
CodeBetter.Foundations.Tests . This does mean that we won’t be able to test private methods
(more on this shortly). In .NET 2.0+ we can use the InternalsVisibleToAttribute to allow the Test
assembly access to our internal method (open Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs and add [assembly:
InternalsVisibleTo(“CodeBetter.Foundations.Tests”)] – which is something I typically do.
There are two things you need to know about nUnit. First, you configure your tests via the use of
attributes. The TestFixtureAttribute is applied to the class that contains your tests, setup and
teardown methods. The SetupAttribute is applied to the method you want to have executed before
each test – you won’t always need this. Similarly, the TearDownAttribute is applied to the method
you want executed after each test. Finally, the TestAttribute is applied to your actual unit tests.
(There are other attributes, but these 4 are the most important). This is what it might look like:
using NUnit.Framework;
[TestFixture]
public class CarTests
{
[SetUp]
public void SetUp() {
[TearDown]
public void TearDown(){

//todo }

//todo }

[Test]

Foundations of Programming

www.codebetter.com

Chapter 5 - Unit Testing

37

public void SaveThrowsExceptionWhenInvalid(){
[Test]
public void SaveCallsDataAccessAndSetsId(){

//todo

}

//todo }

//more tests
}

Notice that each unit test has a very explicit name – it’s important to state exactly what the test is going
to do, and since your test should never do too much, you’ll rarely have obscenely long names.
The second thing to know about nUnit is that you confirm that your test executed as expected via the
use of the Assert class and its many methods. I know this is lame, but if we had a method that took a
param int[] numbers and returned the sum, our unit test would look like:
[Test]
public void MathUtilityReturnsZeroWhenNoParameters()
{
Assert.AreEqual(0, MathUtility.Add());
}
[Test]
public void MathUtilityReturnsValueWhenPassedOneValue()
{
Assert.AreEqual(10, MathUtility.Add(10));
}
[Test]
public void MathUtilityReturnsValueWhenPassedMultipleValues()
{
Assert.AreEqual(29, MathUtility.Add(10,2,17));
}
[Test]
public void MathUtilityWrapsOnOverflow()
{
Assert.AreEqual(-2, MathUtility.Add(int.MaxValue, int.MaxValue));
}

You wouldn’t know it from the above example, but the Assert class has more than one function, such
as Assert.IsFalse, Assert.IsTrue, Assert.IsNull, Assert.IsNotNull, Assert.AreSame,
Assert.AreNotEqual , Assert.Greater, Assert.IsInstanceOfType and so on.

What is a Unit Test
Unit tests are methods that test behavior at a very granular level. Developers new to unit testing often
let the scope of their tests grow. Most unit tests follow the same pattern: execute some code from your
system and assert that it worked as expected. The goal of a unit test is to validate a specific behavior. If
we were to write tests for our Car's Save method, we wouldn't write an all encompassing test, but
rather want to write a test for each of the behavior it contains – failing when the object is in an invalid
state, calling our data access’s Save method and setting the id, and calling the data access’s Update
method. It’s important that our unit test pinpoint a failure as best possible.
I’m sure some of you will find the 4 tests used to cover the MathUtility.Add method a little
excessive. You may think that all 4 tests could be grouped into the same one – and in this minor case I’d
say whatever you prefer. However, when I started unit testing, I fell into the bad habit of letting the
scope of my unit tests grow. I’d have my test which created an object, executed some of its members
and asserted the functionality. But I’d always say, well as long as I’m here, I might as well throw in a
couple extra asserts to make sure these fields are set the way they ought to be. This is very dangerous
because a change in your code could break numerous unrelated tests – definitely a sign that you’ve
given your tests too little focus.
This brings us back to the topic about testing private methods. If you google you’ll find a number of
discussions on the topic, but the general consensus seems to be that you shouldn’t test private
methods. I think the most compelling reason not to test private methods is that our goal is not to test
methods or lines of code, but rather to test behavior. This is something you must always remember. If
you thoroughly test your code’s public interface, then private methods should automatically get tested.
Another argument against testing private methods is that it breaks encapsulation. We talked about the
importance of information hiding already. Private methods contain implementation detail that we want
to be able to change without breaking calling code. If we test private methods directly, implementation
changes will likely break our tests, which doesn’t bode well for higher maintainability.

Mocking
To get started, it’s a good idea to test simple pieces of functionality. Before long though, you’ll want to
test a method that has a dependency on an outside component – such as the database. For example,
you might want to complete your test coverage of the Car class by testing the Save method. Since we
want to keep our tests as granular as possible (and as light as possible – tests should be quick to run so
we can execute them often and get instant feedback) we really don’t want to figure out how we’ll set up
a test database with fake data and make sure it’s kept in a predictable state from test to test. In keeping
with this spirit, all we want to do is make sure that Save interacts property with the DAL. Later on we
can unit test the DAL on its own. If Save works as expected and the DAL works as expected and they
interact properly with each other, we have a good base to move to more traditional testing.
In the previous chapter we saw the beginnings of testing with mocks. We were using a manually created
mock class which had some pretty major limitations. The most significant of which was our inability to
confirm that calls to our mock objects were occurring as expected. That, along with ease of use, is
exactly the problem RhinoMock is meant to solve. Using RhinoMocks couldn’t be simpler, tell it what

39

you want to mock (an interface or a class – preferably an interface), tell it what method(s) you expect to
be called, along with the parameters, execute the call, and have it verify that your expectations were
met.
Before we can get started, we need to give RhinoMocks access to our internal types. This is quickly
achieved by adding [assembly: InternalsVisibleTo("DynamicProxyGenAssembly2")] to our
Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs file.
Now we can start coding by writing a test to cover the update path of our Save method:
[TestFixture]
public class CarTest
{
[Test]
public void SaveCarCallsUpdateWhenAlreadyExistingCar()
{
MockRepository mocks = new MockRepository();
IDataAccess dataAccess = mocks.CreateMock<IDataAccess>();
ObjectFactory.InjectStub(typeof(IDataAccess), dataAccess);
Car car = new Car();
dataAccess.Update(car);
mocks.ReplayAll();
car.Id = 32;
car.Save();
mocks.VerifyAll();
ObjectFactory.ResetDefaults();
}
}

Once a mock object is created, which took 1 line of code to do, we inject it into our dependency
injection framework (StructureMap in this case). When a mock is created, it enters record-mode, which
means any subsequent operations against it, such as the call to dataAccess.UpdateCar(car) , is
recorded by RhinoMocks (nothing really happens since dataAcces is simply a mock object with no real
implementation). We exit record-mode by calling ReplayAll, which means we are now ready to
execute our real code and have it verified against the recorded sequence. When we then call
VerifyAll after having called Save on our Car object, RhinoMocks will make sure that our actual call
behaved the same as what we expected. In other words, you can think of everything before ReplayAll
as stating our expectations, everything after it as our actual test code with VerifyAll doing the final
check.

Chapter 5 - Unit Testing

40

We can test all of this by forcing our test to fail (notice the extra dataAccess.Update call):
[Test]
public void SaveCarCallsUpdateWhenAlreadyExistingCar()
{
MockRepository mocks = new MockRepository();
IDataAccess dataAccess = mocks.CreateMock<IDataAccess>();
ObjectFactory.InjectStub(typeof(IDataAccess), dataAccess);
Car car = new Car();
dataAccess.Update(car);
dataAccess.Update(car);
mocks.ReplayAll();
car.Id = 32;
car.Save();
mocks.VerifyAll();
ObjectFactory.ResetDefaults();
}

Our test will fail with a message from RhinoMocks saying two calls to Update were expected, but only
one actually occurred.
For the Save behavior, the interaction is slightly more complex – we have to make sure the return value
is properly handled by the Save method. Here’s the test:
[Test]
public void SaveCarCallsSaveWhenNew()
{
MockRepository mocks = new MockRepository();
IDataAccess dataAccess = mocks.CreateMock<IDataAccess>();
ObjectFactory.InjectStub(typeof(IDataAccess), dataAccess);
Car car = new Car();
Expect.Call(dataAccess.Save(car)).Return(389);
mocks.ReplayAll();
car.Save();
mocks.VerifyAll();
Assert.AreEqual(389, car.Id);
ObjectFactory.ResetDefaults();
}

Using the Expect.Call method allows us to specify the return value we want. Also notice the
Assert.Equal we’ve added – which is the last step in validating the interaction. Hopefully the
possibilities of having control over return values (as well as output/ref values) lets you see how easy it is
to test for edge cases.

Chapter 5 - Unit Testing

41

If we changed our Save function to throw an exception if the returned id was invalid, our test would
look like:
[TestFixture]
public class CarTest
{
private MockRepository _mocks;
private IDataAccess _dataAccess;
[SetUp]
public void SetUp()
{
_mocks = new MockRepository();
_dataAccess = _mocks.CreateMock<IDataAccess>();
ObjectFactory.InjectStub(typeof(IDataAccess), _dataAccess);
}
[TearDown]
public void TearDown()
{
_mocks.VerifyAll();
}
[Test, ExpectedException("CodeBetter.Foundations.PersistenceException")]
public void SaveCarCallsSaveWhenNew()
{
Car car = new Car();
Expect.Call(_dataAccess.Save(car)).Return(0);
_mocks.ReplayAll();
car.Save();
}
}

In addition to showing how you can test for an exception (via the ExpectedException attribute),
we’ve also extracted the repetitive code that creates, sets up and verifies the mock object into the
SetUp and TearDown methods.

More on nUnit and RhinoMocks
So far we’ve only looked at the basic features offered by nUnit and RhinoMocks, but there’s a lot more
that can actually be done with them. For example, RhinoMocks can be setup to ignore the order of
method calls, instantiate multiple mocks but only replay/verify specific ones, or mock some but not
other methods of a class (a partial mock).
Combined with a utility like NCover, you can also get reports on your tests coverage. Coverage basically
tells you what percentage of an assembly/namespace/class/method was executed by your tests. NCover
has a visual code browser that’ll highlight any un-executed lines of code in red. Generally speaking, I
dislike coverage as a means of measuring the completeness of unit tests. After all, just because you’ve
executed a line of code does not mean you’ve actually tested it. What I do like NCover for is to highlight
any code that has no coverage. In other words, just because a line of code or method has been executed

Chapter 5 - Unit Testing

42

by a test, doesn’t mean you’re test is good. But if a line of code or method hasn’t been executed, then
you need to look at adding some tests.
We’ve mentioned Test Driven Development briefly throughout this book. As has al ready been
mentioned, Test Driven Development, or TDD, is about design, not testing. TDD means that you write
your test first and then write corresponding code to make your test pass. In TDD we’d write our Save
test before having any functionality in the Save method. Of course, our test would fail. We’d then write
the specific behavior and test again. The general mantra for developers is red → green → refactor.
Meaning the first step is to get a failing unit testing, then to make it pass, then to refactor the code as
required.
In my experience, TDD goes very well with Domain Driven Design, because it really lets us focus on the
business rules of the system. If our client says tracking dependencies between upgrades has been a
major pain-point for them, then we set off right away with writing tests that’ll define the behavior and
API of that specific feature. I recommend that you familiarize yourself with unit testing in general before
adopting TDD.

UI and Database Testing
Unit testing your ASP.NET pages probably isn’t worth the effort. The ASP.NET framework is complicated
and suffers from very tight coupling. More often than not you’ll require an actual HTTPContext, which
requires quite a bit of work to setup. If you’re making heavy use of custom HttpHandlers, you should
be able to test those like any other class (depending on exactly what it is your doing of course).
On the other hand, testing your Data Access Layer is possible and I would recommend it. There may be
better methods, but my approach has been to maintain all my CREATE Tables / CREATE Sprocs in text
files along with my project, create a test database on the fly, and to use the Setup and Teardown
methods to keep the database in a known state. The topic might be worth of a future blog post, but for
now, I’ll leave it up to your creativity.

In This Chapter
Unit testing wasn’t nearly as difficult as I first thought it was going to be. Sure my initial tests weren’t the
best – sometimes I would write near-meaningless tests (like testing that a plain-old property was
working as it should) and sometimes they were far too complex and well outside of a well-defined
scope. But after my first project, I learnt a lot about what did and didn’t work. One thing that
immediately became clear was how much cleaner my code became. I quickly came to realize that if
something was hard to test and I rewrote it to make it more testable, the entire code became more
readable, better decoupled and overall easier to work with. The best advice I can give is to start small,
experiment with a variety of techniques, don’t be afraid to fail and learn from your mistakes. And of
course, don’t wait until your project is complete to unit test – write them as you go!

T HE OTHER OPTION INVOLVED WRITING WAY TOO MUCH SQL. - CHRIS KOCH

I

n chapter 3 we took our first stab at bridging the data and object world by hand-writing our own
data access layer and mapper. The approach turned out to be rather limited and required quite a bit
of repetitive code (although it was useful in demonstrating the basics). Adding more objects and
more functionality would bloat our DAL into an enormously unmaintainable violation of DRY (don’t
repeat yourself). In this chapter we’ll look at an actual O/R Mapping framework to do all the heavy lifting
for us. Specifically, we’ll look at the popular open-source NHibernate framework.
The single greatest barrier preventing people from adopting domain driven design is the issue of
persistence. My own adoption of O/R mappers came with great trepidation and doubt. You’ll essentially
be asked to trade in your knowledge of a tried and true method for something that seems a little too
magical. A leap of faith may be required.
The first thing to come to terms with is that O/R mappers generate your SQL for you. I know, it sounds
like it’s going to be slow, insecure and inflexible, especially since you probably figured that it’ll have to
use inline SQL. But if you can push those fears out of your mind for a second, you hav e to admit that it
could save you a lot of time and result in a lot less bugs. Remember, we want to focus on building
behavior, not worry about plumbing (and if it makes you feel any better, a good O/R mapper will provide
simple ways for you to circumvent the automated code generation and execute your own SQL or stored
procedures).

Infamous Inline SQL vs. Stored Procedure Debate
Over the years, there’s been some debate between inline SQL and stored procedures. This debate has
been very poorly worded, because when people hear inline SQL, they think of badly written code like:
string sql = @"SELECT UserId FROM Users
WHERE UserName = '" + userName + "'
AND Password = '" + password + "'";
using (SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand(sql))
{
return 0; //todo
}

Of course, phrased this way, inline SQL really does suck. However, if you stop and think about it and
actually compare apples to apples, the truth is that neither is particularly better than the other. Let's
examine some common points of contention.

Foundations of Programming

Copyright © Karl Seguin

www.codebetter.com

Chapter 6 - Object Relational Mappers

44

Stored Procedures are More Secure
Inline SQL should be written using parameterized queries just like you do with stored procedures. For
example, the correct way to write the above code in order to eliminate the possibility of an SQL injection
attack is:
string sql = @"SELECT UserId FROM Users
WHERE UserName = @UserName AND Password = @Password";
using (SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand(sql))
{
command.Parameters.Add("@UserName", SqlDbType.VarChar).Value = userName;
command.Parameters.Add("@Password ", SqlDbType.VarChar).Value = password;
return 0; //todo
}

From there on, there's not much difference - views can be used or database roles / users can be set up
with appropriate permissions.
Stored procedures provide an abstraction to the underlying schema
Whether you’re using inline SQL or stored procedures, what little abstraction you can put in a SELECT
statement is the same. If any substantial changes are made, your stored procedures are going to break
and there’s a good chance you’ll need to change the calling code to deal with the issue. Essentially, it's
the same code, simply residing in a different location, therefore it cannot provide greater abstraction.
O/R Mappers on the other side, generally provide much better abstraction by being configurable, and
implementing their own query language.
If I make a change, I don’t have to recompile the code
Somewhere, somehow, people got it in their head that
code compilations should be avoided at all cost (maybe
this comes from the days where projects could take days
to compile). If you change a stored procedure, you still
have to re-run your unit and integration tests and deploy
a change to production. It genuinely scares and puzzles
me that developers consider a change to a stored
procedure or XML trivial compared to a similar change in
code.
Stored Procedures reduce network traffic
Who cares? In most cases your database is sitting on a
GigE connection with your servers and you aren’t paying
for that bandwidth. You’re literally talking fractions of
nanoseconds. On top of that, a well configured O/R
mapper can save round-trips via identify map
implementations, caching and lazy loading.

Foundations of Programming

As I've said before, I think it's
generally better to err on the side
of simplicity whenever possible.
Writing a bunch of mindless stored
procedures to perform every
database operation you think you
may need is definitely not what I'd
call simple ... I'm certainly not
ruling out the use of stored
procedures, but to start with
procs? That seems like a fairly
extreme case of premature
optimization to me. - Jeff Atwood,

Stored procedures are faster
This is the excuse I held onto the longest. Write a reasonable/common SQL statement inline and then
write the same thing in a stored procedure and time them. Go ahead. In most cases there’s little or no
difference. In some cases, stored procedures will be slower because a cached execution plan will not be
efficient given a certain parameter. Jeff Atwood called using stored procedures for the sake of better
performance a fairly extreme case of premature optimization. He’s right. The proper approach is to take
the simplest possible approach (let a tool generate your SQL for you), and optimize specific queries
when/if bottlenecks are identified.
It took a while, but after a couple years, I realized that the debate between inline and stored procedures
was as trivial as the one about C# and VB.NET. If it was just a matter of one or the other, then pick
whichever you prefer and move on to your next challenge. If there was nothing more to say on the
topic, I'd pick stored procedures. However, when you add an O/R mapper into the mix, you suddenly
gain significant advantages. You stop participating in stupid flame wars, and simply say "I want that!".
Specifically, there are three major benefits to be had with O/R mappers:
1. You end up writing a lot less code – which obviously results in a more maintainable system,
2. You gain a true level of abstraction from the underlying data source – both because you’re
querying the O/R mapper for your data directly (and it converts that into the appropriate SQL),
and because you’re providing mapping information between your table schemas and domain
objects,
3. Your code becomes simpler- if your impedance mismatch is low, you'll write far less repetitive
code. If your impedance mismatch is high you won't have to compromise your database design
and your domain design - you can build them both in an optimized way, and let the O/R mapper
manage the mismatch.
In the end, this really comes down to building the simplest solution upfront. Optimizations ought to be
left until after you've profiled your code and identified actual bottlenecks. Li ke most things, it might not
sound that simple because of the fairly complex learning to do upfront, but that’s the reality of our
profession.

NHibernate
Of the frameworks and tools we’ve looked at so far, NHibernate is the most complex. This complexity is
certainly something you should take into account when deciding on a persistence solution, but once you
do find a project that allows for some R&D time, the payoff will be well worth it in future projects. The
nicest thing about NHibernate, and a major design goal of the framework, is that it’s completely
transparent – your domain objects aren’t forced to inherit a specific base class and you don’t have to
use a bunch of decorator attributes. This makes unit testing your domain layer possible – if you’re using
a different persistent mechanism, say typed datasets, the tight coupling between domain and data
makes it hard/impossible to properly unit test
At a very high level, you configure NHibernate by telling it how your database (tables and columns) map
to your domain objects, use the NHibernate API and NHibernate Query Language to talk to your
database, and let it do the low level ADO.NET and SQL work. This not only provides separation between
your table structure and domain objects, but also decouples your code from a specific database
implementation.

Remember, our goal is to widen
our knowledgebase by looking at
different ways to build systems in
order to provide our clients with
greater value. While we may be
specifically talking about
NHibernate, the goal is really to
introduce to concept of O/R
mappers, and try to correct the
blind faith .NET developers have
put into stored procedures and
ADO.NET.

In previous chapters we focused on a system for a car
dealership – specifically focusing on cars and upgrades. In
this chapter we’ll change perspective slightly and look at car
sales (sales, models and sales people).The domain model is
simple – a SalesPerson has zero or more Sales which
reference a specific Model.
Also included is a VS.NET solution that contains sample code
and annotations – you can find a link at the end of this
chapter. All you need to do to get it running is create a new
database, execute the provide SQL script (a handful of create
tables), and configure the connection string. The sample,
along with the rest of this chapter, are meant to help you get
started with NHibernate – a topic too often overlooked.

Finally, you'll find the NHibernate reference manual to be of
exceptional quality, both as a helpful tool to get started, and as a reference to lookup specific topics.
There's also a book being published by Manning, NHibernate in Action, that'll be available in June. In the
meantime, you can purchase a pre-release version of the book in electronic format.
Configuration
The secret to NHibernate’s amazing flexibility lies in its configurability. Initially it can be rather daunting
to set it up, but after a coupe project it becomes rather natural. The first step is to configure NHibernate
itself. The simplest configuration, which must be added to your app.config or web.config, looks like:

Chapter 6 - Object Relational Mappers

47

<configuration>
<configSections>
<section name="hibernate-configuration"
type="NHibernate.Cfg.ConfigurationSectionHandler, NHibernate" />
</configSections>
<hibernate-configuration xmlns="urn:nhibernate-configuration-2.2">
<session-factory>
<property name="hibernate.dialect">
NHibernate.Dialect.MsSql2005Dialect
</property>
<property name="hibernate.connection.provider">
NHibernate.Connection.DriverConnectionProvider
</property>
<property name="hibernate.connection.connection_string">
Server=SERVER;Initial Catalog=DB;User Id=USER;Password=PASSWORD;
</property>
<mapping assembly="CodeBetter.Foundations" />
</session-factory>
</hibernate-configuration>
</configuration>

Of the four values, dialect is the most interesting. This tells NHibernate what specific language our
database speaks. If, in our code, we ask NHibernate to return a paged result of Cars and our dialect is
set to SQL Server 2005, NHibernate will issue an SQL SELECT utilizing the ROW_NUMBER() ranking
function. However, if the dialect is set to MySQL, NHibernate will issue a SELECT with a LIMIT. In most
cases, you’ll set this once and forget about it, but it does provide some insight into the capabilities
provide by a layer that generates all of your data access code.
In our configuration, we also told NHibernate that our mapping files were located in the
CodeBetter.Foundations assembly. Mapping files are embedded XML files which tell NHibernate
how each class is persisted. With this information, NHibernate is capable of returning a Car object when
you ask for one, as well as saving it. The general convention is to have a mapping file per domain object,
and for them to be placed inside a Mappings folder. The mapping file for our Model object, named
Model.hbm.xml, looks like:
<hibernate-mapping xmlns="urn:nhibernate-mapping-2.2"
assembly="CodeBetter.Foundations"
namespace="CodeBetter.Foundations">
<class name="Model" table="Models" lazy="true" proxy="Model">
<id name="Id" column="Id" type="int" access="field.lowercase-underscore">
<generator class="native" />
</id>
<property name="Name" column="Name"
type="string" not-null="true" length="64" />
<property name="Description" column="Description"
type="string" not-null="true" />
<property name="Price" column="Price"
type="double" not-null="true" />
</class>

</hibernate-mapping>

(it’s important to make sure the Build Action for all mapping files is set to Embedded Resources)
This file tells NHibernate that the Model class maps to rows in the Models table, and that the 4
properties Id, Name, Description and Price map to the Id, Name, Description and Price
columns. The extra information around the Id property specifies that the value is generated by the
database (as opposed to NHibernate itself (for clustered solutions for example), or our own algorithm)
and that there’s no setter, so it should be accessed by the field with the specified naming convention
(we supplied Id as the name, and lowercase-underscore as the naming strategy, so it’ll use a field
named _id).
With the mapping file set up, we can start interacting with the database:
private static ISessionFactory _sessionFactory;
public void Sample()
{
//Let's add a new car model
Model model = new Model();
model.Name = "Hummbee";
model.Description = "Great handling, built-in GPS to always find your
way back home, Hummbee2Hummbe(tm) communication";
model.Price = 50000.00;
ISession session = _sessionFactory.OpenSession();
session.Save(model);
//Let's discount the x149 model
IQuery query = session.CreateQuery("from Model model where model.Name = ?");
Model model = query.SetString(0, "X149").UniqueResult<Model>();
model.Price -= 5000;
ISession session = _sessionFactory.OpenSession();
session.Update(model);
}

The above example shows how easy it is to persist new objects to the database, retrieve them and
update them – all without any ADO.NET or SQL.
You may be wondering where the _sessionFactory object comes from, and exactly what an
ISession is. The _sessionFactory (which implements ISessionFactory) is a global thread-safe
object that you’d likely create on application start. You’ll typically need one per database that your
application is using (which means you’ll typically only need one), and its job, like most factories, is to
create a preconfigured object: an ISession. The ISession has no ADO.NET equivalent, but it does
map loosely to a database connection. However, creating an ISession doesn’t necessarily open up a
connection. Instead, ISessions smartly manage connections and command objects for you. Unlike
connections which should be opened late and closed early, you needn’t worry about having ISessions
stick around for a while (although they aren’t thread-safe). If you’re building an ASP.NET application, you

Chapter 6 - Object Relational Mappers

49

could safely open an ISession on BeginRequest and close it on EndRequest (or better yet, lazyload it in case the specific request doesn’t require an ISession).
ITransaction is another piece of the puzzle which is created by calling BeginTransaction on an
ISession. It’s common for .NET developers to ignore the need for transactions within their

applications. This is unfortunate because it can lead to unstable and even unrecoverable states in the
data. An ITransaction is used to keep track of the unit of work – tracking what’s changed, been
added or deleted, figuring out what and how to commit to the database, and providing the capability to
rollback should an individual step fail.
Relationships
In our system, it’s important that we track sales – specifically with respect to salespeople, so that we can
provide some basic reports. We’re told that a sale can only ever belong to a single salesperson, and thus
set up a one-to-many relationship – that is, a salesperson can have multiple sales, and a sales can only
belong to a single salesperson. In our database, this relationship is represented as a SalesPersonId
column in the Sales table (a foreign key). In our domain, the SalesPerson class has a Sales
collection and the Sales class has a SalesPerson property (reference).
Both ends of the relationship needs to be setup in the appropriate mapping file. On the Sales end,
which maps a single property, we use a glorified property element called many-to-one:
...
<many-to-one name="SalesPerson"
class="SalesPerson"
column="SalesPersonId"
not-null="true"/>
...

We’re specifying the name of the property, the type/class, and the foreign key column name. We’re also
specifying an extra constraint, that is, when we add a new Sales object, the SalesPerson property
can’t be null.
The other side of the relationship, the collection of sales a salesperson has, is slightly more complicated
– namely because NHibernate’s terminology isn’t standard .NET lingo. To set up a collection we use a
set, list, map, bag or array element. Your first inclination might be to use list, but NHibernate
requires that you have a column that specifies the index. In other words, the NHibernate team sees a list
as a collection where the index is important, and thus must be specified. What most .NET developers
think of as a list, NHibernate calls a bag. Confusingly, whether you use a list or a bag element, your
domain type must be an IList (or its generic IList<T> equivalent). This is because .NET doesn’t have
an IBag object. In short, for your every day collection, you use the bag element and make your property
type an IList.

Foundations of Programming

Chapter 6 - Object Relational Mappers

50

The other interesting collection option is the set. A set is a collection that cannot contain duplicates – a
common scenario for enterprise application (although it is rarely explicitly stated). Oddly, .NET doesn’t
have a set collection, so NHibernate uses the Iesi.Collection.ISet interface. There are four
specific implementations, the ListSet which is really fast for very small collections (10 or less items),
the SortedSet which can be sorted, the HashSet which is fast for larger collections and the
HybridSet which initially uses a ListSet and automatically switches itself to a HashSet as your
collection grows.
For our system we’ll use a bag (even though we can’t have duplicate sales, it’s just a little more
straightforward right now), so we declare our Sales
collection as an IList:
private IList<Sale> _sales;
public IList<Sale> Sales
{
get { return _sales;}
}

and add our <bag> element to the SalesPerson mapping
file:
<bag name="Sales" access="field.lowercaseunderscore"
table="Sales" inverse="true"
cascade="all">
<key column="SalesPersonId" />
<one-to-many class="Sale" />
</bag>

With the release of .NET 3.5, a
HashSet collection has finally been
added to the framework. Hopefully,
future versions will add other types
of sets, such as an OrderedSet. Sets
are very useful and efficient
collections, so consider adding
them to your arsenal of tools! You
can learn more by reading Jason
Smith's article describe sets.

Again, if you look at each element/attribute, it isn’t as complicated as it first might seem. We identify
the name of our property, specify the access strategy (we don’ t have a setter, so tell it to use the field
with our naming convention), the table and column holding the foreign key, and the type/class of the
items in the collection.
We’ve also set the cascade attribute to all which means that when we call Update on a
SalesPerson object, any changes made to his or her Sales collection (additions, removals, changes to
existing sales) will automatically be persisted. Cascading can be a real time-saver as your system grows
in complexity.
Querying
NHibernate supports two different querying approaches: Hibernate Query Language (HQL) and Criteria
Queries (you can also query in actual SQL, but lose portability when doing so). HQL is the easier of two
as it looks a lot like SQL – you use from, where, aggregates, order by, group by, etc. However,
rather than querying against your tables, you write queries against your domain – which means HQL

Foundations of Programming

www.codebetter.com

Chapter 6 - Object Relational Mappers

51

supports OO principles like inheritance and polymorphism. Either query methods are abstractions on
top of SQL, which means you get total portability – all you need to do to target a different database is
change your dialect configuration.
HQL works off of the IQuery interface, which is created by calling CreateQuery on your session. With
IQuery you can return individual entities, collections, substitute parameters and more. Here are some
examples:
string lastName = "allen";
ISession session = _sessionFactory.OpenSession();
//retrieve a salesperson by last name
IQuery query = s.CreateQuery("from SalesPerson p where p.LastName =
'allen'");
SalesPerson p = query.UniqueResult<SalesPerson>();
//same as above but in 1 line, and with the last name as a variable
SalesPerson p = session.CreateQuery("from SalesPerson p where p.LastName =
?").SetString(0, lastName).UniqueResult<SalesPerson>();
//people with few sales
IList<SalesPerson> slackers = session.CreateQuery("from SalesPerson person
where size(person.Sales) < 5").List<SalesPerson>();

This is just a subset of what can be accomplished with HQL (the downloadable sample has slightly more
complicated examples).
Lazy Loading
When we load a salesperson, say by doing: SalesPerson person =
session.Get<SalesPerson>(1); the Sales collection won’t be loaded. That’s because, by default,
collections are lazily loaded. That is, we won’t hit the database until the information is specifically
requested (i.e., we access the Sales property). We can override the behavior by setting
lazy=”false” on the bag element.
The other, more interesting, lazy load strategy implemented by NHibernate is on entities themselves.
You’ll often want to add a reference to an object without having to load the actual object from the
database. For example, when we add a Sales to a SalesPerson, we need to specify the Model, but
don’t want to load every property – all we really want to do is get the Id so we can store it in the
ModelId column of the Sales table. When you use session.Load<T>(id) NHibernate will load a
proxy of the actual object (unless you specify lazy=”false” in the class element). As far as you’re
concerned, the proxy behaves exactly like the actual object, but none of the data will be retrieved from
the database until the first time you ask for it. This makes it possible to write the following code:
Sale sale = new Sale(session.Load<Model>(1), DateTime.Now, 46000.00);
salesPerson.AddSales(sale);

session.SaveOrUpdate(salesPerson);

without ever having to actually hit the database to load the Model.

Download
You can download a sample project with more examples of NHibernate usage at:
http://codebetter.com/files/folders/codebetter_downloads/entry172562.aspx . The code is heavily
documented to explain various aspects of using NHibernate. (If the above link does not work for you,
you can try this alternative download location: http://openmymind.net/CodeBetter.Foundations.zip).

In This Chapter
We’ve only touched the tip of what you can do with NHibernate. We haven’t looked at its Criteria
Queries (which is a query API tied even closer to your domain), its caching capabilities, filtering of
collections, performance optimizations, logging, or native SQL abilities. Beyond NHibernate the tool,
hopefully you’ve learnt more about object relational mapping, and alternative solutions to the limited
toolset baked into .NET. It is hard to let go of hand written SQL but, stepping beyond what's
comfortable, it's impossible to ignore the benefits of O/R mappers.

You're more than half way through! I hope you're enjoying yourself and learning a lot. This
might be a good time to take a break from reading and get a little more hands-on with the free

NOT 'GETTING' ALGEBRA IS NOT ACCEPTABLE FOR A MATHEMATICIAN, AS NOT
'GETTING' POINTERS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE FOR PROGRAMMERS . T OO FUNDAMENTAL.
- WARD CUNNINGHAM

T

ry as they might, modern programming language can't fully abstract fundamental aspects of
computer systems. This is made evident by the various exceptions thrown by high level
languages. For example, it's safe to assume that you've likely faced the following .NET exceptions:
NullReferneceException , OutOfMemoryException , StackOverflowException and
ThreadAbortException . As important as it is for developers to embrace various high level patterns
and techniques, it's equally important to understand the ecosystem in which your program runs.
Looking past the layers provided by the C# (or VB.NET) compiler, the CLR and the operating system, we
find memory. All programs make extensive use of system memory and interact with it in marvelous
ways, it's difficult to be a good programmer without understanding this fundamental interaction.
Much of the confusion about memory stems from the fact that C# and VB.NET are managed languages
and that the CLR provides automatic garbage collection. This has caused many developers to
erroneously assume that they need not worry about memory.

Memory Allocation
In .NET, as with most languages, every variable you define is either stored on the stack or in the heap.
These are two separate spaces allocated in system memory which serve a distinct, yet complimentary
purpose. What goes where is predetermined: value types go on the stack, while all reference types go
on the heap. In other words, all the system types, such as char, int, long, byte, enum and any
structures (either defined in .NET or defined by you) go on the stack. The only exception to this rule are
value types belonging to reference types - for example the Id property of a User class goes on the heap
along with the instance of the User class itself.
The Stack
Although we're used to magical garbage collection, values on the stack are automatically managed even
in a garbage collectionless world (such as C). That's because whenever you enter a new scope (such as a
method or an if statement) values are pushed onto the stack
If you've ever wondered why a
and when you exit the stack the values are popped off. This is
variable defined in a for loop or if
why a stack is synonymous with a LIFO - last-in first-out. You
can think of it this way: whenever you create a new scope,
statement wasn't available outside
say a method, a marker is placed on the stack and values are
that scope, it's because the stack
added to it as needed. When you leave that scope, all values
has unwound itself and the value is
are popped off up to and including the method marker. This
lost.
works with any level of nesting.

Chapter 7 - Back to Basics: Memory

54

Until we look at the interaction between the heap and the stack, the only real way to get in trouble with
the stack is with the StackOverflowException. This means that you've used up all the space
available on the stack. 99.9% of the time, this indicates an endless recursive call (a function which calls
itself ad infinitum). In theory it could be caused by a very, very poorly designed system, though I've
never seen a non-recursive call use up all the space on the stack.
The Heap
Memory allocation on the heap isn't as straightforward as on the stack. Most heap-based memory
allocation occurs whenever we create a new object. The compiler figures out how much memory we'll
need (which isn't that difficult, even for objects with nested references), carves up an appropriate chunk
of memory and returns a pointer to the allocated memory (more on this in moments). The simplest
example is a string, if each character in a string takes up 2 bytes, and we create a new string with the
value of "Hello World", then the CLR will need to allocate 22 bytes (11x2) plus whatever overhead is
needed.
Speaking of strings, you've no doubt heard that string are immutable - that is, once you've declared a
string and assigned it a value, if you modify that string (by changing its value, or concatenating another
string onto it), then a new string is created. This can actually have negative performance implications,
and so the general recommendation is to use a StringBuilder for any significant string manipulation.
The truth though is that any object stored on the heap is immutable with respect to size allocation, and
any changes to the underlying size will require new allocation. The StringBuilder, along with some
collections, partially get around this by using internal buffers. Once the buffer fills up though, the same
reallocation occurs and some type of growth algorithm is used to determined the new size (the simplest
being oldSize * 2). Whenever possible it's a good idea to specify the initial capacity of such objects in
order to avoid this type of reallocation (the constructor for both the StringBuilder and the
ArrayList (amongst many other collections) allow you to specify an initial capacity).
Garbage collecting the heap is a non-trivial task. Unlike the stack where the last scope can simply be
popped off, objects in the heap aren't local to a given scope. Instead, most are deeply nested references
of other referenced objects. In languages such as C, whenever a programmer causes memory to be
allocated on the heap, he or she must also make sure to remove it from the heap when he's finished
with it. In managed languages, the runtime takes care of cleaning up resources (.NET uses a
Generational Garbage Collector which is briefly described on Wikipedia).
There are a lot of nasty issues that can sting developers while working with the heap. Memory leaks
aren't only possible but very common, memory fragmentation can cause all types of havoc, and various
performance issues can arise due to strange allocation behavior or interaction with unmanaged code
(which.NET does a lot under the covers).

Pointers
For many developers, learning pointers in school was a painful experience. They represent the very real
indirection which exists between code and hardware. Many more developers have never had the
experience of learning them - having jumped into programming directly from a language which didn't
expose them directly. The truth though is that anyone claiming that C# or Java are pointerless languages
is simply wrong. Since pointers are the mechanism by which all languages manage values on the heap, it
seems rather silly not to understand how they are used.
Pointers represent the nexus of a system's memory model - that is, pointers are the mechanism by
which the stack and the heap work together to provide the memory subsystem required by your
program. As we discussed earlier, whenever you instantiate a new object, .NET allocates a chunk of
memory on the heap and returns a pointer to the start of this memory block. This is all a pointer is: the
starting address for the block of memory containing an object. This address is really nothing more than
an unique number, generally represented in hexadecimal format. Therefore, a pointer is nothing more
than a unique number that tells .NET where the actual object is in memory. When you assign a
reference type to a variable, your variable is actually a pointer to the object. This indirection is
transparent in Java or .NET, but not in C or C++ where you can manipulate the memory address directly
via pointer arithmetic. In C or C++ you could take a pointer and add 1 to it, hence arbitrarily changing
where it points to (and likely crashing your program because of it).
Where it gets interesting is where the pointer is actually stored. They actually follow the same rules
outlined above: as integers they are stored on the stack - unless of course they are part of a reference
object and then they are on the heap with the rest of their object. It might not be clear yet, but this
means that ultimately, all heap objects are rooted on the stack (possibly through numerous levels of
references). Let's first look at a simple example:
static void Main(string[] args)
{
int x = 5;
string y = "codebetter.com";
}

From the above code, we'll end up with 2 values on the stack, the integer 5 and the pointer to our string,
as well as the actual string on the heap. Here's a graphical representation:

Foundations of Programming

Chapter 7 - Back to Basics: Memory

56

When we exit our main function (forget the fact that the program will stop), our stack pops off all local
values, meaning both the x and y values are lost. This is significant because the memory allocate d on the
heap still contains our string, but we've lost all references to it (there's no pointer pointing back to it). In
C or C++ this results in a memory leak - without a reference to our heap address we can't free up the
memory. In C# or Java, our trusty garbage collector will detect the unreferenced object and free it up.
We'll look at a more complex examples, but aside from having more arrows, it's basically the same.
public class Employee
{
private int _employeeId;
private Employee _manager;
public int EmployeeId
{
get { return _employeeId; }
set { _employeeId = value; }
}
public Employee Manager
{
get { return _manager; }
set { _manager = value; }
}
public Employee(int employeeId)
{
_employeeId = employeeId;
}
}
public class Test
{
private Employee _subordinate;
void DoSomething()
{
Employee boss = new Employee(1);
_subordinate = new Employee(2);
_subordinate.Manager = _boss;
}
}

Some prefer to call the type of
pointers found in C#, VB.NET and
Java References or Safe Pointers,
because they either point to a valid
object or null. There is no such
guarantee in languages such as C
or C++ since developers are free to
manipulate pointers directly.

57

Interestingly, when we leave our method, the boss variable
will pop off the stack, but the subordinate, which is defined in
a parent scope, won't. This means the garbage collector won't
have anything to clean-up because both heap values will still
be referenced (one directly from the stack, and the other
indirectly from the stack through a referenced object).
As you can see, pointers most definitely play a significant part
in both C# and VB.NET. Since pointer arithmetic isn't available
in either language, pointers are greatly simplified and
hopefully easily understood.

Memory Model in Practice
We'll now look at the actual impact this has on our applications. Keep in mind though that
understanding the memory model in play won't only help you avoid pitfalls, but it will also help you
write better applications.
Boxing
Boxing occurs when a value type (stored on the stack) is coerced onto the heap. Unboxing happens
when these value types are placed back onto the stack. The simplest way to coerce a value type, such as
an integer, onto the heap is by casting it:
int x = 5;
object y = x;

A more common scenario where boxing occurs is when you supply a value type to a method that
accepts an object. This was common with collections in .NET 1.x before the introduction of generics. The
non-generic collection classes mostly work with the object type, so the following code results in boxing
and unboxing:
ArrayList userIds = new ArrayList(2);
userIds.Add(1);
userIds.Add(2);;
int firstId = (int)userIds[0];

The real benefit of generics is the increase in type-safety, but they also address the performance penalty
associated with boxing. In most cases you wouldn't notice this penalty, but in some situations, such as
large collections, you very well could. Regardless of whether or not it's something you ought to actually
concern yourself with, boxing is a prime example of how the underlying memory system can have an
impact on your application.

Without a good understanding of pointers, it's virtually impossible to understand passing a value by
reference and by value. Developers generally understand the implication of passing a value type, such as
an integer, by reference, but few understand why you'd want to pass a reference by reference. ByRef
and ByVal affect reference and value types the same - provided you understand that they always work
against the underlying value (which in the case of a reference type means they work against the pointer
and not the value). Using ByRef is the only common situation where .NET won't automatically resolve
the pointer indirection (passing by reference or as an output parameter isn't allowed in Java).
First we'll look at how ByVal/ByRef affects value types. Given the following code:
public static void Main()
{
int counter1 = 0;
SeedCounter(counter1);
Console.WriteLine(counter1);
int counter2 = 0;
SeedCounter(ref counter2);
Console.WriteLine(counter2);
}
private static void SeedCounter(int counter)
{
counter = 1;
}
private static void SeedCounter(ref int counter)
{
counter = 1;
}

We can expect an output of 0 proceeded by 1. The first call does not pass counter1 by reference,
meaning a copy of counter1 is passed into SeedCounter and changes made within are local to the
function. In other words, we're taking the value on the stack and duplicating it onto another stack
location.
In the second case we're actually passing the value by reference which means no copy is created and
changes aren't localized to the SeedCounter function.
The behavior with reference types is the exact same, although it might not appear so at first. We'll look
at two examples. The first one uses a PayManagement class to change the properties of an Employee.
In the code below we see that we have two employees and in both cases we're giving them a $2000
raise. The only difference is that one passes the employee by reference while the other is passed by
value. Can you guess the output?

public class Employee
{
private int _salary;
public int Salary
{
get {return _salary;}
set {_salary = value;}
}
public Employee(int startingSalary)
{
_salary = startingSalary;
}
}
public class PayManagement
{
public static void GiveRaise(Employee employee, int raise)
{
employee.Salary += raise;
}
public static void GiveRaise(ref Employee employee, int raise)
{
employee.Salary += raise;
}
}
public static void Main()
{
Employee employee1 = new Employee(10000);
PayManagement.GiveRaise(employee1, 2000);
Console.WriteLine(employee1.Salary);
Employee employee2 = new Employee(10000);
PayManagement.GiveRaise(ref employee2, 2000);
Console.WriteLine(employee2.Salary);
}

In both cases, the output is 12000. At first glance, this seems different than what we just saw with value
types. What's happening is that passing a reference type by value does indeed pass a copy of the value,
but not the heap value. Instead, we're passing a copy of our pointer. And since a pointer and a copy of
the pointer point to the same memory on the heap, a change made by one is reflected in the other.
When you pass a reference type by reference, you're passing the actual pointer as opposed to a copy of
the pointer. This begs the question, when would we ever pass a reference type by reference? The only
reason to pass by reference is when you want to modify the pointer itself - as in where it points to. This
can actually result in nasty side effects - which is why it's a good thing functions wanting to do so must
specifically specify that they want the parameter passed by reference. Let's look at our second example.

public class Employee

PayManagement.Terminate(employee1);
Console.WriteLine(employee1.Salary);
Employee employee2 = new Employee(10000);
PayManagement.Terminate(ref employee2);
Console.WriteLine(employee2.Salary);
}

Try to figure out what will happen and why. I'll give you a hint: an exception will be thrown. If you
guessed that the call to employee1.Salary outputted 10000 while the 2nd one threw a
NullReferenceException then you're right. In the first case we're simply setting a copy of the
original pointer to null - it has no impact whatsoever on what employee1 is pointing to. In the second
case, we aren't passing a copy but the same stack value used by employee2. Thus setting the employee
to null is the same as writing employee2 = null;.
It's quite uncommon to want to change the address pointed to by a variable from within a separate
method - which is why the only time you're likely to see a reference type passed by reference is when
you want to return multiple values from a function call (in which case you're better off using an out
parameter, or using a purer OO approach). The above example truly highlights the dangers of playing in
an environment whose rules aren't fully understood.

Managed Memory Leaks
We already saw an example of what a memory leak looks like in C. Basically, if C# didn't have a garbage
collector, the following code would leak:
private void DoSomething()
{
string name = "dune";
}

Our stack value (a pointer) will be popped off, and with it will go the only way we have to reference the
memory created to hold our string. Leaving us with no method of freeing it up. This isn't a problem in
.NET because it does have a garbage collector which tracks unreferenced memory and frees it. However,
a type of memory leak is still possible if you hold on to references indefinitely. This is common in large
applications with deeply nested references. They can be hard to identify because the leak might be very
small and your application might not run for long enough
Ultimately when your program terminates the operating system will reclaim all memory, leaked or
otherwise. However, if you start seeing OutOfMemoryException and aren't dealing with abnormally
large data, there's a good chance you have a memory leak. .NET ships with tools to help you out, but
you'll likely want to take advantage of a commercial memory profiler such as dotTrace or ANTS Profiler.
When hunting for memory leaks you'll be looking for your leaked object (which is pretty easy to find by
taking 2 snapshots of your memory and comparing them), tracing through all the objects which still hold
a reference to it and correcting the issue.
There's one specific situation worth mentioning as a common cause of memory leaks: events. If, in a
class, you register for an event, a reference is created to your class. Unless you de -register from the
event your objects lifecycle will ultimately be determined by the event source. In other words, if ClassA
(the listener) registers for an event in ClassB (the event source) a reference is created from ClassB to
ClassA. Two solutions exists: de-registering from events when you're done (the IDisposable pattern is
the ideal solution), or use the WeakEvent Pattern or a simplified version.
Fragmentation
Another common cause for OutOfMemoryException has to do with memory fragmentation. When
memory is allocated on the heap it's always a continuous block. This means that the available memory
must be scanned for a large enough chunk. As your program runs its course, the heap becomes
increasingly fragmented (like your hard drive) and you might end up with plenty of space, but spread out
in a manner which makes it unusable. Under normal circumstances, the garbage collector will compact
the heap as it's freeing memory. As it compacts memory, addresses of objects change and .NET makes
sure to update all your references accordingly. Sometimes though, .NET can't move an object: namely
when the object is pinned to a specific memory address.

Chapter 7 - Back to Basics: Memory

62

Pinning
Pinning occurs when an object is locked to a specific address on the heap. Pinned memory cannot be
compacted by the garbage collector resulting in fragmentation. Why do values get pinned? The most
common cause is because your code is interacting with unmanaged code. When the .NET garbage
collector compacts the heap, it updates all references in managed code, but it has no way to jump into
unmanaged code and do the same. Therefore, before interoping it must first pin objects in memory.
Since many methods within the .NET framework rely on unmanaged code, pinning can happen without
you knowing about it (the scenario I'm most familiar with are the .NET Socket classes which rely on
unmanaged implementations and pin buffers).
A common way around this type of pinning is to declare large objects which don't cause as much
fragmentation as many small ones (this is even more true considering large objects are placed in a
special heap (called the Large Object Heap (LOH) which isn't compacted at all). For example, rather than
creating hundreds of 4KB buffers, you can create 1 large buffer and assign chunks of it yourself. For an
example as well as more information on pinning, I suggest you read Greg Young's advanced post on
pinning and asynchronous sockets.
There's a second reason why an object might be pinned - when you explicitly make it happen. In C# (not
in VB.NET) if you compile your assembly with the unsafe option, you can pin an object via the fixed
statement. While extensive pinning can cause memory pressures on the system, judicial use of the
fixed statement can greatly improve performance. Why? Because a pinned object can be manipulated
directly with pointer arithmetic - this isn't possible if the object isn't pinned because the garbage
collector might reallocate your object somewhere else in memory.
Take for example this efficient ASCII string to integer conversion which runs over 6 times faster than
using int.Parse.
public unsafe static int Parse(string stringToConvert)
{
int value = 0;
int length = stringToConvert.Length;
fixed(char* characters = stringToConvert)
{
for (int i = 0; i < length; ++i)
{
value = 10 * value + (characters[i] - 48);
}
}
return value;
}

Unless you're doing something abnormal, there should never be a need to mark your assembly as
unsafe and take advantage of the fixed statement. The above code will easily crash (pass null as the
string and see what happens), isn't nearly as feature rich as int.Parse, and in the scale of things is
extremely risky while providing no benefits.

Setting things to null
So, should you set your reference types to null when you're done with them? Of course not. Once a
variable falls out of scope, it's popped of the stack and the reference is removed. If you can't wait for the
scope to exit, you likely need to refactor your code.

Deterministic Finalization
Despite the presence of the garbage collector, developers must still take care of managing some of their
references. That's because some objects hold on to vital or limited resources, such as file handle s or
database connections which should be released as soon as possible. This is problematic since we don't
know when the garbage collector will actually run - by nature the garbage collector only runs when
memory is in short supply. To compensate, classes which hold on to such resources should make use of
the Disposable pattern. All .NET developers are likely familiar with this pattern, along with its actual
implementation (the IDisposable interface), so we won't rehash what you already know. With
respect to this chapter, it's simply important that you understand the role deterministic finalization
takes. It doesn't free the memory used by the object. It releases resources. In the case of database
connections for example, it releases the connection back to the pool in order to be reused.
If you forget to call Dispose on an object which implements IDisposable, the garbage collector will
do it for you (eventually). You shouldn't rely on this behavior, however, as the problem of limited
resources is very real (it's relatively trivial to try it out with a loop that opens connections to a database).
You may be wondering why some objects expose both a Close and Dispose method, and which you
should call. In all the cases I've seen the two are generally equivalent - so it's really a matter of taste. I
would suggest that you take advantage of the using statement and forget about Close. Personally I
find it frustrating (and inconsistent) that both are exposed.
Finally, if you're building a class that would benefit from deterministic finalization you'll find that
implementing the IDisposable pattern is simple. A straightforward guide is available on MSDN.

In This Chapter
Stacks, heaps and pointers can seem overwhelming at first. Within the context of managed languages
though, there isn't really much to it. The benefits of understanding these concepts are tangible in day to
day programming, and invaluable when unexpected behavior occurs. You can either be the programmer
who causes weird NullReferenceExceptions and OutOfMemoryExceptions, or the one that fixes
them.

FAIL FAST - JIM SHORE

E

xceptions are such powerful constructs that developers can get a little overwhelmed and far too
defensive when dealing with them. This is unfortunate because exceptions actually represent a
key opportunity for developers to make their system considerably more robust. In this chapter
we'll look at three distinct aspects of exceptions : handling, creating and throwing them. Since
exceptions are unavoidable you can neither run nor hide, so you might as well leverage.

Handling Exceptions
Your strategy for handling exceptions should consist of two golden rules:
1. Only handle exceptions that you can actually do something about, and
2. You can't do anything about the vast majority of exceptions
Most new developers do the exact opposite of the first rule, and fight hopelessly against the second.
When your application does something deemed exceptionally outside of its normal operation the best
thing to do is fail it right then and there. If you don't you won't only lose vital information about your
mystery bug, but you risk placing your application in an unknown state, which can result in far worse
consequences.
Whenever you find yourself writing a try/catch statement, ask yourself if you can actually do something
about a raised exception. If your database goes down, can you actually write code to recover or are you
better off displaying a friendly error message to the user and getting a notification about the problem?
It's hard to accept at first, but sometimes it's just better to crash, log the error and move on. Even for
mission critical systems, if you're making typical use of a database, what can you do if it goes down? This
train of thought isn't limited to database issues or even just environmental failures, but also you r typical
every-day runtime bug . If converting a configuration value to an integer throws a FormatException
does it make sense continuing as if everything's ok? Probably not.
Of course, if you can handle an exception you absolutely ought to - but do make sure to catch only the
type of exception you can handle. Catching exceptions and not actually handling them is called
exception swallowing (I prefer to call it wishful thinking) and it's a bad code. A common example I see
has to do with input validation. For example, let's look at how not to handle a categoryId being
passed from the QueryString of an ASP.NET page.
int categoryId;
try
{
categoryId = int.Parse(Request.QueryString["categoryId"]);
}
catch(Exception)

65

{
categoryId = 1;
}

The problem with the above code is that regardless of the type of exception thrown, it'll be handled the
same way. But does setting the categoryId to a default value of 1 actually handle an
OutOfMemoryException ? Instead, the above could should catch a specific exception:
int categoryId;
try
{
categoryId = int.Parse(Request.QueryString["categoryId"])
}
catch(FormatException)
{
categoryId = -1;
}

(an even better approach would be the use the int.TryParse function introduced in .NET 2.0 especially considering that int.Parse can throw two other types of exceptions that we'd want to
handle the same way, but that's besides the point).
Logging
Even though most exceptions are going to go unhandled, you should still log each and every one of
them. Ideally you'll centralize your logging - an HttpModule's OnError event is your best choice for an
ASP.NET application or web service. I've often seen developers catch exceptions where they occur only
to log and rethrow (more on rethrowing in a bit). This causes
a lot of unnecessary and repetitive code - better to let

log4net or Microsoft's Logging Application Block.
Cleaning Up
In the previous chapter we talked about deterministic finalization with respect to the lazy nature of the
garbage collector. Exceptions prove to be an added complexity as their abrupt nature can cause
Dispose not to be called. A failed database call is a classic example:

SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(FROM_CONFIGURATION)
SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand("SomeSQL", connection);
connection.Open();
command.ExecuteNonQuery();
command.Dispose();
connection.Dispose();

If ExecuteNonQuery throws an exception, neither our command nor our connection will get disposed
of. The solution is to use Try/Finally:
SqlConnection connection;
SqlCommand command;
try
{
connection = new SqlConnection(FROM_CONFIGURATION)
command = new SqlCommand("SomeSQL", connection);
connection.Open();
command.ExecuteNonQuery();
}
finally
{
if (command != null) { command.Dispose(); }
if (connection != null) { connection.Dispose(); }
}

or the syntactically nicer using statement (which gets compiled to the same try/finally above):
using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(FROM_CONFIGURATION))
using (SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand("SomeSQL", connection))
{
connection.Open();
command.ExecuteNonQuery();
}

The point is that even if you can't handle an exception, and you should centralize all your logging, you do
need to be mindful of where exceptions can crop up - especially when it comes to classes that
implement IDiposable.

Throwing Exceptions
There isn't one magic rule to throwing exceptions like there is for catching them (again, that rule is don't
catch exceptions unless you can actually handle them). Nonetheless throwing exceptions, whether or
not they be your own (which we'll cover next), is still pretty simple. First we'll look at the actual
mechanics of throwing exceptions, which relies on the throw statement. Then we'll examine when and
why you actually want to throw exceptions.
Throwing Mechanics
You can either throw a new exception, or rethrow a caught exception. To throw a new exception, simply
create a new exception and throw it.
throw new Exception("something bad happened!");
//or
Exception ex = new Exception("something bad happened");
throw ex;

I added the second example because some developers think exceptions are some special/unique case but the truth is that they are just like any other object (except they inherit from System.Exception
which in turn inherits from System.Object). In fact, just because you create a new exception
doesn't mean you have to throw it - although you probably always would.
On occasion you'll need to rethrow an exception because, while you can't handle the exception, you still
need to execute some code when an exception occurs. The most common example is having to rollback
a transaction on failure:
ITransaction transaction = null;
try
{
transaction = session.BeginTransaction();
// do some work
transaction.Commit();
}
catch
{
if (transaction != null) { transaction.Rollback(); }
throw;
}
finally
{
//cleanup
}

In the above example our vanilla throw statement makes our catch transparent. That is, a handler up
the chain of execution won't have any indication that we caught the exception. In most cases, this is

Chapter 8 - Back to Basics: Exceptions

68

what we want - rolling back our transaction really doesn't help anyone else handle the exception.
However, there's a way to rethrow an exception which will make it look like the exception occurred
within our code:
catch (HibernateException ex)
{
if (transaction != null) { transaction.Rollback(); }
throw ex;
}

By explicitly rethrowing the exception, the stack trace is modified so that the rethrowing line appears to
be the source. This is almost always certainly a bad idea, as vital information is lost. So be careful how
you rethrow exceptions - the difference is subtle but important.
If you find yourself in a situation where you think you want to rethrow an exception with your handler
as the source, a better approach is to use a nested exception:
catch (HibernateException ex)
{
if (transaction != null) { transaction.Rollback(); }
throw new Exception("Email already in use", ex);
}

This way the original stack trace is still accessible via the InnerException property exposed by all
exceptions.
When To Throw Exceptions
It's important to know how to throw exceptions. A far more interesting topic though is when and why
you should throw them. Having someone else's unruly code bring down your application is one thing.
Writing your own code that'll do the same thing just seems plain silly. However, a good developer isn't
afraid to judicially use exceptions.
There are actually two levels of thought on how exceptions should be used. The first level, which is
universally accepted, is that you shouldn't hesitate to raise an exception whenever a truly exceptional
situation occurs. My favorite example is the parsing of configuration files. Many developers generously
use default values for any invalid entries. This is ok in some cases, but in others it can put the system in
an unreliable or unexpected state. Another example might be a Facebook application that gets an
unexpected result from an API call. You could ignore the error, or you could raise an exception, log it (so
that you can fix it, since the API might have changed) and present a helpful message to your users.
The other belief is that exceptions shouldn't just be reserved for exceptional situations, but for any
situation in which the expected behavior cannot be executed. This approach is related to the design by

Foundations of Programming

Chapter 8 - Back to Basics: Exceptions

69

contract approach - a methodology that I'm adopting more and more every day. Essentially, if the
SaveUser method isn't able to save the user, it should throw an exception.
In languages such as C#, VB.NET and Java, which don't support a design by contract mechanism, this
approach can have mixed results. A Hashtable returns null when a key isn't found, but a Dictionary
throws an exception - the unpredictable behavior sucks (if you're curious why they work differently
check out Brad Abrams blog post). There's also a line between what constitutes control flow and what's
considered exceptional. Exceptions shouldn't be used to control an if/else-like logic, but the bigger a
part they play in a library, the more likely programmers will use them as such (the int.Parse method
is a good example of this).
Generally speaking, I find it easy to decide what should and shouldn't throw an exception. I generally ask
myself questions like:





Is this exceptional,
Is this expected,
Can I continue doing something meaningful at this point and
Is this something I should be made aware of so I can fix it, or at least give it a second look

Perhaps the most important thing to do when throwing exceptions, or dealing with exceptions in
general, is to think about the user. The vast majority of users are naive compared to programmers and
can easily panic when presented with error messages. Jeff Atwood recently blogged about the
importance of crashing responsibly.



IT IS NOT THE USER'S JOB TO TELL YOU ABOUT ERRORS IN YOUR SOFTWARE!



DON'T EXPOSE USERS TO THE DEFAULT SCREEN OF DEATH.



HAVE A DETAILED PUBLIC RECORD OF YOUR APPLICATION'S ERRORS .

It's probably safe to say that Windows' Blue Screen of Death is exactly the type of error message users
shouldn't be exposed to (and don't think just because the bar has been set so low that it's ok to be as
lazy).

Creating Custom Exceptions
One of the most overlooked aspect of domain driven design are custom exceptions. Exceptions play a
serious part of any business domain, so any serious attempt at modeling a business domain in code
must include custom exceptions. This is especially true if you believe that exceptions should be used
whenever a method fails to do what it says it will. If a workflow state is invalid it makes sense to throw
your own custom WorkflowException exception and even attach some specific information to it
which might not only help you identify a potential bug, but can also be used to present meaningful
information to the user.

70

Many of the exceptions I create are nothing more than marker exceptions - that is, they extend the base
System.Exception class and don't provide further implementation. I liken this to marker interfaces
(or marker attributes), such as the INamingContainer interface. These are particularly useful in
allowing you to avoid swallowing exceptions. Take the following code as an example. If the Save()
method doesn't throw a custom exception when validation fails, we really have little choice but to
swallow all exceptions:
try
{
user.Save();
}
catch
{
Error.Text = user.GetErrors();
Error.Visible = true;
}
//versus
try
{
user.Save();
}
catch(ValidationException ex)
{
Error.Text = ex.GetValidationMessage();
Error.Visible = true;
}

The above example also shows how we can extend exceptions to provide further custom behavior
specifically related to our exceptions. This can be as simple as an ErrorCode, to more complex
information such as a PermissionException which exposes the user's permission and the missing
required permission.
Of course, not all exceptions are tied to the domain. It's common to see more operational-oriented
exceptions. If you rely on a web service which returns an error code, you may very wrap that into your
own custom exception to halt execution (remember, fail fast) and leverage your logging infrastructure.
Actually creating a custom exception is a two step process. First (and technically this is all you really
need) create a class, with a meaningful name, which inherits from System.Exception.
public class UpgradeException : Exception
{
}

You should go the extra step and mark your class with the SerializeAttribute and always provide
at least 4 constructors:

public YourException()
public YourException(string message)
public YourException(string message, Exception innerException)
protected YourException(SerializationInfo info, StreamingContext context)

The first three allow your exception to be used in an expected manner. The fourth is used to support
serialization incase .NET needs to serialize your exception - which means you should also implement the
GetObjectData method. The purpose of support serialization is in the case where you have custom
properties, which you'd like to have survive being serialized/deserialized. Here's the complete example:
[Serializable]
public class UpgradeException: Exception
{
private int _upgradeId;
public int UpgradeId { get { return _upgradeId; } }
public UpgradeException(int upgradeId)
{
_upgradeId = upgradeId;
}
public UpgradeException(int upgradeId, string message, Exception inner)
: base(message, inner)
{
_upgradeId = upgradeId;
}
public UpgradeException(int upgradeId, string message) : base(message)
{
_upgradeId = upgradeId;
}
protected UpgradeException(SerializationInfo info, StreamingContext c)
: base(info, c)
{
if (info != null)
{
_upgradeId = info.GetInt32("upgradeId");
}
}
public override void GetObjectData(SerializationInfo i, StreamingContext c)
{
if (i != null)
{
i.AddValue("upgradeId", _upgradeId);
}
base.GetObjectData(i, c)
}
}

In This Chapter
It can take quite a fundamental shift in perspective to appreciate everything exceptions have to offer.
Exceptions aren't something to be feared or protected against, but rather vital information about the
health of your system. Don't swallow exceptions. Don't catch exceptions unless you can actually handle
them. Equally important is to make use of built-in, or your own exceptions when unexpected things
happen within your code. You may even expand this pattern for any method that fails to do what it says
it will. Finally, exceptions are a part of the business you are modeling. As such, exceptions aren't only
useful for operational purposes but should also be part of your overall domain model.

F

ew keywords are as simple yet amazingly powerful as virtual in C# ( overridable in VB.NET).
When you mark a method as virtual you allow an inheriting class to override the behavior.
Without this functionality inheritance and polymorphism wouldn't be of much use. A simple
example, slightly modified from Programming Ruby (ISBN: 978-0-9745140-5-5), which has a
KaraokeSong overrides a Song's to_s (ToString) function looks like:
class Song

return sprintf("Song: %s, %s (%d)", @name, @artist, @duration)

return super + " - " @lyrics

end

The above code shows how the KaraokeSong is able to
build on top of the behavior of its base class. Specialization
isn't just about data, it's also about behavior!
Even if your ruby is a little rusty, you might have picked up
that the base to_s method isn't marked as virtual. That's
because many languages, including Java, make methods
virtual by default. This represents a fundamental differing of
opinion between the Java language designers and the
C#/VB.NET language designers. In C# methods are final by
default and developers must explicitly allow overriding (via
the virtual keyword). In Java, methods are virtual by
default and developers must explicitly disallow overriding
(via the final keyword).

The virtual by default vs final by
default debate is interesting, but
outside the scope of this chapter. If
you're interested in learning more, I
suggest you read this interview
with Anders Hejlsberg (C#'s Lead
Architect), as well as these two
blog posts by Eric Gunnerson. As
well, check out Michael Feathers
point of view.

Typically virtual methods are discussed with respect to inheritance of domain models. That is, a
KaraokeSong which inherits from a Song, or a Dog which inherits from a Pet. That's a very important
concept, but it's already well documented and well understood. Therefore, we'll examine virtual
methods for a more technical purpose: proxies.

Proxy Domain Pattern
A proxy is something acting as something else. In legal terms, a proxy is someone given authority to vote
or act on behalf of someone else. Such a proxy has the same rights and behaves pretty much li ke the
person being proxied. In the hardware world, a proxy server sits between you and a server you're
accessing. The proxy server transparently behaves just like the actual server, but with additional
functionality - be it caching, logging or filtering. In software, the proxy design pattern is a class that
behaves like another class. For example, if we were building a task tracking system, we might decide to
use a proxy to transparently apply authorization on top of a task object:
public class Task
{
public static Task FindById(int id)
{
return TaskRepository.Create().FindById(id);
}
public virtual void Delete()
{
TaskRepository.Create().Delete(this);
}
}
public class TaskProxy : Task
{
public override void Delete()
{
if (User.Current.CanDeleteTask())
{
base.Delete();
}
else
{
throw new PermissionException(...);
}
}
}

Thanks to polymorphism, FindById can return either a Task or a TaskProxy. The calling client
doesn't have to know which was returned - it doesn't even have to know that a TaskProxy exists. It just
programs against the Task's public API.
Since a proxy is just a subclass that implements additional behavior, you might be wondering if a Dog is
a proxy to a Pet. Proxies tend to implement more technical system functions (logging, caching,
authorization, remoting, etc) in a transparent way. In other words, you wouldn't declare a variable as
TaskProxy - but you'd likely declare a Dog variable. Because of this, a proxy wouldn't add members
(since you aren't programming against its API), whereas a Dog might add a Bark method.

Interception
The reason we're exploring a more technical side of inheritance is because two of the tools we've l ooked
at so far, RhinoMocks and NHibernate, make extensive use of proxies - even though you might not have
noticed. RhinoMocks uses proxies to support its core record/playback functionality. NHibernate relies on
proxies for its optional lazy-loading capabilities. We'll only look at NHibernate, since it's easier to
understand what's going on behind the covers, but the same high level pattern applies to RhinoMocks.
(A side note about NHibernate. It's considered a frictionless or transparent O/R mapper because it
doesn't require you to modify your domain classes in order to work. However, if you want to enable lazy
loading, all members must be virtual. This is still considered frictionless/transparent since you aren't
adding NHibernate specific elements to your classes - such as inheriting from an NHibernate base class
or sprinkling NHibernate attributes everywhere.)
Using NHibernate there are two distinct opportunities to leverage lazy loading. The first, and most
obvious, is when loading child collections. For example, you may not want to load all of a Model's
Upgrades until they are actually needed. Here's what your mapping file might look like:
<class name="Model" table="Models">
<id name="Id" column="Id" type="int">
<generator class="native" />
</id>
...
<bag name="Upgrades" table="Upgrades" lazy="true" >
<key column="ModelId" />
<one-to-many class="Upgrade" />
</bag>
</class>

By setting the lazy attribute to true on our bag element, we are telling NHibernate to lazily load the
Upgrades collection. NHibernate can easily do this since it returns its own collection types (which all
implement standard interfaces, such as IList, so to you, it's transparent).
The second, and far more interesting, usage of lazy loading is for individual domain objects. The general
idea is that sometimes you'll want whole objects to be lazily initialized. Why? Well, say that a sale has
just been made. Sales are associated with both a sales person and a car model:
Sale sale = new Sale();
sale.SalesPerson = session.Get<SalesPerson>(1);
sale.Model = session.Get<Model>(2);
sale.Price = 25000;
session.Save(sale);

Unfortunately, we've had to go to the database twice to load the appropriate SalesPerson and Model
- even though we aren't really using them. The truth is all we need is their ID (since that's what gets
inserted into our database), which we already have.
By creating a proxy, NHibernate lets us fully lazy-load an object for just this type of circumstance. The
first thing to do is change our mapping and enable lazy loading of both Models and SalesPeoples:
<class name="Model" table="Models" lazy="true" proxy="Model">...</class>
<class name="SalesPerson" table="SalesPeople"
lazy="true" proxy="SalesPerson ">...</class>

The proxy attribute tells NHibernate what type should be proxied. This will either be the actual class
you are mapping to, or an interface implemented by the class. Since we are using the actual class as our
proxy interface, we need to make sure all members are virtual - if we miss any, NHibernate will throw a
helpful exception with a list of non-virtual methods. Now we're good to go:
Sale sale = new Sale();
sale.SalesPerson = session.Load <SalesPerson>(1);
sale.Model = session.Load<Model>(2);
sale.Price = 25000;
session.Save(sale);

Notice that we're using Load instead of Get. The difference between the two is that if you're retrieving
a class that supports lazy loading, Load will get the proxy, while Get will get the actual object. With this
code in place we're no longer hitting the database just to load IDs. Instead, calling
Session.Load<Model>(2) returns a proxy - dynamically generated by NHibernate. The proxy will
have an id of 2, since we supplied it the value, and all other properties will be uninitialized. Any call to
another member of our proxy, such as sale.Model.Name will be transparently intercepted and the
object will be just-in-time loaded from the database.
Just a note, NHibernate's lazy-load behavior can be hard to spot when debugging code in Visual Studio.
That's because VS.NET's watch/local/tooltip actually inspects the object, causing the load to happen
right away. The best way to examine what's going on is to add a couple breakpoints around your code
and check out the database activity either through NHibernate's log, or SQL profiler.
Hopefully you can imagine how proxies are used by RhinoMocks for recording, replaying and verifying
interactions. When you create a partial you're really creating a proxy to your actual object. This proxy
intercepts all calls, and depending on which state you are, does its own thing. Of course, for this to work,
you must either mock an interface, or a virtual members of a class.

In This Chapter
In chapter 6 we briefly covered NHibernate's lazy loading capabilities. In this chapter we expanded on
that discussion by looking more deeply at the actual implementation. The use of proxies is common
enough that you'll not only frequently run into them, but will also likely have good reason to implement
some yourself. I still find myself impressed at the rich functionality provided by RhinoMock and
NHibernate thanks to the proxy design pattern. Of course, everything hinges on you allowing them to
override or insert their behavior over your classes. Hopefully this chapter will also make you think about
which of your methods should and which shouldn't be virtual. I strongly recommend that you follow the
links provided on the first page of this chapter to understand the pros and cons of virtual and final
methods.

or many, programming is a challenging and enjoyable job that pays the bills. However, given that
you've managed to read through all of this, there's a good chance that, like me, programming is
something much more important to you. It's a craft, and what you create means more to you than
probably any non-programmer can understand. I take great pleasure and pride is building something
that stands up to my level of quality, and learning from the parts that I know need to be improved.
It isn't easy to build quality software. A new features here or a misunderstanding there, and our hard
work starts, ever so slightly, to show weakness. That's why it's important to have a truly solid
understanding of the foundations of good software design. We managed to cover a lot of real
implementation details, but at a high level, here are my core principles of good software engineering:










The most flexible solution is the simplest. I've worked on projects with flexibility built into the
system upfront. It's always been a disaster. At the core of this belief lie in YAGNI, DRY, KISS and
explicitness.
Coupling is unavoidable, but must be minimized. The more dependent a class is on another
class, or a layer on another layer, the harder your code is to change. I strongly believe that the
path to mastering low-coupling is via unit tests. Badly coupled code will be impossible to test
and plainly obvious.
The notion that developers shouldn't test has been the anti-silver bullet of our time. You are
responsible (and hopefully accountable) for the code that you write, and thinking that a method
or class does what it's supposed to isn't good enough. The pursuit of perfection should be good
enough reason to write tests, but, there are even better reasons to do so. Testing helps you
identify bad coupling. Testing helps you find awkwardness in your API. Testing helps you
document behavior and expectations. Testing lets you make small and radical changes with far
greater confidence and far less risk.
It's possible to build successful software without being Agile - but it's far less likely and a lot less
fun. My joys would be short-lived without ongoing customer collaboration. I would quit this field
without iterative development. I would be living in a dream if I required signed off specifications
before starting to develop.
Question the status quo and always be on the lookout for alternatives. Spend a good amount of
time learning. Learn different languages and different frameworks. Learning Ruby and Rails has
made me a far better programmer. I can pinpoint the beginning of my journey in becoming a
better programmer to a few years ago when I was deeply entrenched in the source code for an
open source project, trying to make heads of tails of it.

My last piece of advice is not to get discouraged. I'm a slow learner, and the more I learn, the more I
realize how little I know. I still don't understand half of what my peers on CodeBetter.com blog
about (seriously). If you're willing to take the time and try it out, you will see the progress. Pick a
simple project for yourself and spend a weekend building it using new tools and principles (just pick
one or two at a time). Most importantly, if you aren't having fun, don't do it. And if you have the
opportunity to learn from a mentor or a project, take it - even if you learn more from the mistakes
than the successes.
I sincerely hope you found something valuable in here. If you wish, you can thank me by doing
something nice for someone special you care about, something kind for a stranger, or something
meaningful for our environment.
