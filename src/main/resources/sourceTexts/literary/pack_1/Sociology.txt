OpenStax College
OpenStax College is a non-profit organization committed to improving student access to quality learning materials. Our free textbooks
are developed and peer-reviewed by educators to ensure they are readable, accurate, and meet the scope and sequence requirements
of modern college courses. Through our partnerships with companies and foundations committed to reducing costs for students,
OpenStax College is working to improve access to higher education for all.

Connexions
The technology platform supporting OpenStax College is Connexions (http://cnx.org), one of the world’s first and largest openeducation projects. Connexions provides students with free online and low-cost print editions of the OpenStax College library and
provides instructors with tools to customize the content so that they can have the perfect book for their course.

Rice University
OpenStax College and Connexions are initiatives of Rice University. As a leading research
university with a distinctive commitment to undergraduate education, Rice University aspires
to path-breaking research, unsurpassed teaching, and contributions to the betterment of our
world. It seeks to fulfill this mission by cultivating a diverse community of learning and
discovery that produces leaders across the spectrum of human endeavor.

Foundation Support
OpenStax College is grateful for the tremendous support of our sponsors. Without their strong engagement, the goal of free access to
high-quality textbooks would remain just a dream.
The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation has been making grants since 1967 to help
solve social and environmental problems at home and around the world. The
Foundation concentrates its resources on activities in education, the environment, global
development and population, performing arts, and philanthropy, and makes grants to
support disadvantaged communities in the San Francisco Bay Area.
Guided by the belief that every life has equal value, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation
works to help all people lead healthy, productive lives. In developing countries, it
focuses on improving people’s health with vaccines and other life-saving tools and
giving them the chance to lift themselves out of hunger and extreme poverty. In the
United States, it seeks to significantly improve education so that all young people have
the opportunity to reach their full potential. Based in Seattle, Washington, the foundation
is led by CEO Jeff Raikes and Co-chair William H. Gates Sr., under the direction of Bill
and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett.

Our mission at the Twenty Million Minds Foundation is to grow access and success by
eliminating unnecessary hurdles to affordability. We support the creation, sharing, and
proliferation of more effective, more affordable educational content by leveraging
disruptive technologies, open educational resources, and new models for collaboration
between for-profit, nonprofit, and public entities.

The Maxfield Foundation supports projects with potential for high impact in science,
education, sustainability, and other areas of social importance.

Introduction to Sociology
Concerts, sports games, and political rallies can have very large crowds. When you attend one of these
events, you may know only the people you came with. Yet you may experience a feeling of connection
to the group. You are one of the crowd. You cheer and applaud when everyone else does. You boo and

9

10

CHAPTER 1 | AN INTRODUCTION TO SOCIOLOGY

yell alongside them. You move out of the way when someone needs to get by, and you say "excuse me"
when you need to leave. You know how to behave in this kind of crowd.
It can be a very different experience if you are traveling in a foreign country and find yourself in a
crowd moving down the street. You may have trouble figuring out what is happening. Is the crowd just
the usual morning rush, or is it a political protest of some kind? Perhaps there was some sort of accident
or disaster. Is it safe in this crowd, or should you try to extract yourself? How can you find out what is
going on? Although you are in it, you may not feel like you are part of this crowd. You may not know
what to do or how to behave.
Even within one type of crowd, different groups exist and different behaviors are on display. At a
rock concert, for example, some may enjoy singing along, others prefer to sit and observe, while still
others may join in a mosh pit or try crowd surfing. Why do we feel and act differently in different types
of social situations? Why might people of a single group exhibit different behaviors in the same
situation? Why might people acting similarly not feel connected to others exhibiting the same behavior?
These are some of the many questions sociologists ask as they study people and societies.

1.1 What Is Sociology?

Figure 1.2 Sociologists learn about society as a whole while studying one-to-one and group interactions. (Photo courtesy

A dictionary defines sociology as the systematic study of society and social interaction. The word
“sociology” is derived from the Latin word socius (companion) and the Greek word logos (study of),
meaning “the study of companionship.” While this is a starting point for the discipline, sociology is
actually much more complex. It uses many different methods to study a wide range of subject matter
and to apply these studies to the real world.

What Are Society and Culture?
Sociologists study all aspects and levels of society. A society is a group of people whose members
interact, reside in a definable area, and share a culture. A culture includes the group’s shared practices,
values, and beliefs. One sociologist might analyze video of people from different societies as they carry
on everyday conversations to study the rules of polite conversation from different world cultures.
Another sociologist might interview a representative sample of people to see how texting has changed
the way they communicate. Yet another sociologist might study how migration determined the way in
which language spread and changed over time. A fourth sociologist might be part of a team developing
signs to warn people living thousands of years in the future, and speaking many different languages, to
stay away from still-dangerous nuclear waste.

The Sociological Imagination
Although these studies and the methods of carrying them out are different, the sociologists involved in
them all have something in common. Each of them looks at society using what pioneer sociologist C.
Wright Mills called the sociological imagination, sometimes also referred to as the sociological lens or
sociological perspective. Mills defined sociological imagination as how individuals understand their
own and others’ pasts in relation to history and social structure (1959).

CHAPTER 1 | AN INTRODUCTION TO SOCIOLOGY

By looking at individuals and societies and how they interact through this lens, sociologists are
able to examine what influences behavior, attitudes, and culture. By applying systematic and scientific
methods to this process, they try to do so without letting their own biases and pre-conceived ideas
influence their conclusions.
Studying Patterns: How Sociologists View Society
All sociologists are interested in the experiences of individuals and how those experiences are shaped
by interactions with social groups and society as a whole. To a sociologist, the personal decisions an
individual makes do not exist in a vacuum. Cultural patterns and social forces put pressure on people to
select one choice over another. Sociologists try to identify these general patterns by examining the
behavior of large groups of people living in the same society and experiencing the same societal
pressures.
The recent turmoil in the U.S. housing market and the high rate of foreclosures offer an example of
how a sociologist might explore social patterns. Owning a home has long been considered an essential
part of the American Dream. People often work for years to save for a down payment on what will be
the largest investment they ever make. The monthly mortgage is often a person’s largest budget item.
Missing one or more mortgage payments can result in serious consequences. The lender may foreclose
on the mortgage and repossess the property. People may lose their homes and may not be able to
borrow money in the future. Walking away from the responsibility to pay debts is not a choice most
people make easily.
About three million homes were repossessed in the United States between 2006 and 2011. Experts
predict the number could double by 2013 (Levy and Gop 2011). This is a much higher rate than the
historical average. What social factors are contributing to this situation, and where might sociologists
find patterns? Do Americans view debt, including mortgages, differently than in the past? What role do
unemployment rates play? Might a shift in class structure be an influential factor? What about the way
major economic players operate?
To answer these questions, sociologists will look beyond individual foreclosures at national trends.
They will see that in recent years unemployment has been at record highs. They will observe that many
lenders approved subprime mortgages with adjustable rates that started low and ballooned. They may
look into whether unemployment and lending practices were different for members of different social
classes, races, or genders. By analyzing the impact of these external conditions on individuals’ choices,
sociologists can better explain why people make the decisions they do.

Another example of how society influences individual decisions can be seen in people’s opinions
about and use of food stamps (also known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP
benefits). Some people believe that those who receive food stamps are lazy and unmotivated. Statistics
from the United States Department of Agriculture show a complex picture.

The percentage of the population receiving food stamps is much higher in certain states than in
others. Does this mean, if the stereotype above were applied, that people in some states are lazier and
less motivated than those in other states? Sociologists study the economies in each state—comparing
unemployment rates, food, energy costs, and other factors—to explain differences in social issues like
this.
To identify social trends, sociologists also study how people use food stamps and how people react
to their use. Research has found that for many people from all classes, there is a strong stigma attached
to the use of food stamps. This stigma can prevent people who qualify for this type of assistance from
using food stamps. According to Hanson and Gundersen (2002), how strongly this stigma is felt is
linked to the general economic climate. This illustrates how sociologists observe a pattern in society.
Sociologists identify and study patterns related to all kinds of contemporary social issues. The
“don’t ask, don’t tell” policy, the emergence of the Tea Party as a political faction, how Twitter has
influenced everyday communication—these are all examples of topics that sociologists might explore.
Studying Part and Whole: How Sociologists View Social Structures
A key basis of the sociological perspective is the concept that the individual and society are inseparable.
It is impossible to study one without the other. German sociologist Norbert Elias called the process of
simultaneously analyzing the behavior of individuals and the society that shapes that behavior
figuration. He described it through a metaphor of dancing. There can be no dance without the dancers,
but there can be no dancers without the dance. Without the dancers, a dance is just an idea about
motions in a choreographer’s head. Without a dance, there is just a group of people moving around a
floor. Similarly, there is no society without the individuals that make it up, and there are also no
individuals who are not affected by the society in which they live (Elias 1978).
An application that makes this concept understandable is the practice of religion. While people
experience their religion in a distinctly individual manner, religion exists in a larger social context. For
instance, an individual’s religious practice may be influenced by what government dictates, holidays,
teachers, places of worship, rituals, and so on. These influences underscore the important relationship
between individual practices of religion and social pressures that influence that religious experience.

Careers in Sociology

Individual-Society Connections
When sociologist Nathan Kierns spoke to his friend Ashley (a pseudonym) about the move she
and her partner had made from an urban center to a small Midwestern town, he was curious how

CHAPTER 1 | AN INTRODUCTION TO SOCIOLOGY

the social pressures placed on a lesbian couple differed from one community to the other. Ashley
said that in the city they had been accustomed to getting looks and hearing comments when she
and her partner walked hand in hand. Otherwise, she felt that they were at least being tolerated.
There had been little to no outright discrimination.
Things changed when they moved to the small town for her partner’s job. For the first time,
Ashley found herself experiencing direct discrimination because of her sexual orientation. Some of
it was particularly hurtful. Landlords would not rent to them. Ashley, who is a highly trained
professional, had a great deal of difficulty finding a new job.
When Nathan asked Ashley if she and her partner became discouraged or bitter about this
new situation, Ashley said that rather than letting it get to them, they decided to do something
about it. Ashley approached groups at a local college and several churches in the area. Together
they decided to form the town's first gay-straight alliance.
The alliance has worked successfully to educate their community about same-sex couples. It
also worked to raise awareness about the kinds of discrimination Ashley and her partner
experienced in the town and how those could be eliminated. The alliance has become a strong
advocacy group, working to attain equal rights for LBGT individuals.
Kierns observed that this is an excellent example of how negative social forces can result in a
positive response from individuals to bring about social change (Kierns 2011).

Figure 1.4 People have been thinking like sociologists long before sociology became a separate academic discipline: Plato
and Aristotle, Confucius, Khaldun, and Voltaire all set the stage for modern sociology. (Photos (a),(b),(d) courtesy of Wikimedia
Commons; Photo (c) courtesy of Moumou82/Wikimedia Commons)
Since ancient times, people have been fascinated by the relationship between individuals and the
societies to which they belong. Many of the topics that are central to modern sociological scholarship
were studied by ancient philosophers. Many of these earlier thinkers were motivated by their desire to
describe an ideal society.
In the 13th century, Ma Tuan-Lin, a Chinese historian, first recognized social dynamics as an
underlying component of historical development in his seminal encyclopedia, General Study of Literary
Remains. The next century saw the emergence of the historian some consider to be the world’s first
sociologist: Ibn Khaldun (1332–1406) of Tunisia. He wrote about many topics of interest today, setting
a foundation for both modern sociology and economics, including a theory of social conflict, a
comparison of nomadic and sedentary life, a description of political economy, and a study connecting a
tribe’s social cohesion to its capacity for power (Hannoum 2003).
In the 18th century, Age of Enlightenment philosophers developed general principles that could be
used to explain social life. Thinkers such as John Locke, Voltaire, Immanuel Kant, and Thomas Hobbes
responded to what they saw as social ills by writing on topics that they hoped would lead to social
reform.
The early 19th century saw great changes with the Industrial Revolution, increased mobility, and
new kinds of employment. It was also a time of great social and political upheaval with the rise of
empires that exposed many people—for the first time—to societies and cultures other than their own.
Millions of people were moving into cities and many people were turning away from their traditional
religious beliefs.

CHAPTER 1 | AN INTRODUCTION TO SOCIOLOGY

The Father of Sociology

Figure 1.5 Auguste Comte is considered by many to be the father of sociology. (Photo courtesy of Wikimedia Commons)
The term sociology was first coined in 1780 by the French essayist Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès
(1748–1836) in an unpublished manuscript (Fauré et al. 1999). In 1838, the term was reinvented by
Auguste Comte (1798–1857). Comte originally studied to be an engineer, but later became a pupil of
social philosopher Claude Henri de Rouvroy Comte de Saint-Simon (1760–1825). They both thought
that society could be studied using the same scientific methods utilized in natural sciences. Comte also
believed in the potential of social scientists to work toward the betterment of society. He held that once
scholars identified the laws that governed society, sociologists could address problems such as poor
education and poverty (Abercrombie et al. 2000).
Comte named the scientific study of social patterns positivism. He described his philosophy in a
series of books called The Course in Positive Philosophy (1830–1842) and A General View of
Positivism (1848). He believed that using scientific methods to reveal the laws by which societies and
individuals interact would usher in a new “positivist” age of history. While the field and its terminology
have grown, sociologists still believe in the positive impact of their work.

Karl Marx

Figure 1.6 Karl Marx was one of the founders of sociology. His ideas about social conflict are still relevant today. (Photo

Karl Marx (1818–1883) was a German philosopher and economist. In 1848 he and Friedrich Engels
(1820–1895) coauthored the Communist Manifesto. This book is one of the most influential political
manuscripts in history. It also presents Marx's theory of society, which differed from what Comte
proposed.
Marx rejected Comte's positivism. He believed that societies grew and changed as a result of the
struggles of different social classes over the means of production. At the time he was developing his
theories, the Industrial Revolution and the rise of capitalism led to great disparities in wealth between
the owners of the factories and workers. Capitalism, an economic system characterized by private or
corporate ownership of goods and the means to produce them, grew in many nations.
Marx predicted that inequalities of capitalism would become so extreme that workers would
eventually revolt. This would lead to the collapse of capitalism, which would be replaced by
communism. Communism is an economic system under which there is no private or corporate

CHAPTER 1 | AN INTRODUCTION TO SOCIOLOGY

ownership: everything is owned communally and distributed as needed. Marx believed that
communism was a more equitable system than capitalism.
While his economic predictions may not have come true in the time frame he predicted, Marx’s
idea that social conflict leads to change in society is still one of the major theories used in modern
sociology.

Creating a Discipline
In 1873, the English philosopher Herbert Spencer (1820–1903) published The Study of Sociology, the
first book with the term “sociology” in the title. Spencer rejected much of Comte’s philosophy as well
as Marx's theory of class struggle and his support of communism. Instead, he favored a form of
government that allowed market forces to control capitalism. His work influenced many early
sociologists including Émile Durkheim (1858–1917).
Durkheim helped establish sociology as a formal academic discipline by establishing the first
European department of sociology at the University of Bordeaux in 1895 and by publishing his Rules of
the Sociological Method in 1895. In another important work, Division of Labour in Society (1893),
Durkheim laid out his theory on how societies transformed from a primitive state into a capitalist,
industrial society. According to Durkheim, people rise to their proper level in society based on merit.
Durkheim believed that sociologists could study objective “social facts” (Poggi 2000). He also
believed that through such studies it would be possible to determine if a society was “healthy” or
“pathological.” He saw healthy societies as stable, while pathological societies experienced a
breakdown in social norms between individuals and society.
In 1897, Durkheim attempted to demonstrate the effectiveness of his rules of social research when
he published a work titled Suicide. Durkheim examined suicide statistics in different police districts to
research differences between Catholic and Protestant communities. He attributed the differences to
socioreligious forces rather than to individual or psychological causes.
Prominent sociologist Max Weber (1864–1920) established a sociology department in Germany at
the Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich in 1919. Weber wrote on many topics related to
sociology including political change in Russia and social forces that affect factory workers. He is
known best for his 1904 book, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism. The theory that Weber
sets forth in this book is still controversial. Some believe that Weber was arguing that the beliefs of
many Protestants, especially Calvinists, led to the creation of capitalism. Others interpret it as simply
claiming that the ideologies of capitalism and Protestantism are complementary.
Weber also made a major contribution to the methodology of sociological research. Along with
other researchers such as Wilhelm Dilthey (1833–1911) and Heinrich Rickert (1863–1936), Weber
believed that it was difficult if not impossible to use standard scientific methods to accurately predict
the behavior of groups as people hoped to do. They argued that the influence of culture on human
behavior had to be taken into account. This even applied to the researchers themselves, who, they
believed, should be aware of how their own cultural biases could influence their research. To deal with
this problem, Weber and Dilthey introduced the concept of verstehen, a German word that means to
understand in a deep way. In seeking verstehen, outside observers of a social world—an entire culture
or a small setting—attempt to understand it from an insider’s point of view.
In his book The Nature of Social Action (1922), Weber described sociology as striving to "interpret
the meaning of social action and thereby give a causal explanation of the way in which action proceeds
and the effects it produces." He and other like-minded sociologists proposed a philosophy of
antipositivism whereby social researchers would strive for subjectivity as they worked to represent
social processes, cultural norms, and societal values. This approach led to some research methods
whose aim was not to generalize or predict (traditional in science), but to systematically gain an indepth understanding of social worlds.
The different approaches to research based on positivism or antipositivism are often considered the
foundation for the differences found today between quantitative sociology and qualitative sociology.
Quantitative sociology uses statistical methods such as surveys with large numbers of participants.
Researchers analyze data using statistical techniques to see if they can uncover patterns of human
behavior. Qualitative sociology seeks to understand human behavior by learning about it through indepth interviews, focus groups, and analysis of content sources (like books, magazines, journals, and
popular media).

CHAPTER 1 | AN INTRODUCTION TO SOCIOLOGY

Making Connections:

Social Policy

& Debate

How Do Working Moms Impact Society?
What constitutes a “typical family” in America has changed tremendously over the past decades.
One of the most notable changes has been the increasing number of mothers who work outside the
home. Earlier in U.S. society, most family households consisted of one parent working outside the
home and the other being the primary childcare provider. Because of traditional gender roles and
family structures, this was typically a working father and a stay-at-home mom. Quantitative
research shows that in 1940 only 27 percent of all women worked outside the home. Today, 59.2
percent of all women do. Almost half of women with children younger than one year of age are
employed (U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee Report 2010).
Sociologists interested in this topic might approach its study from a variety of angles. One
might be interested in its impact on a child’s development, another may explore related economic
values, while a third might examine how other social institutions have responded to this shift in
society.
A sociologist studying the impact of working mothers on a child’s development might ask
questions about children raised in childcare settings. How is a child socialized differently when
raised largely by a childcare provider rather than a parent? Do early experiences in a school-like
childcare setting lead to improved academic performance later in life? How does a child with two
working parents perceive gender roles compared to a child raised with a stay-at-home parent?
Another sociologist might be interested in the increase in working mothers from an economic
perspective. Why do so many households today have dual incomes? Has there been a contributing
change in social class expectations? What impact does the larger economy play in the economic
conditions of an individual household? Do people view money—savings, spending,
debt—differently than they have in the past?
Curiosity about this trend’s influence on social institutions might lead a researcher to explore
its effect on the nation’s educational system. Has the increase in working mothers shifted
traditional family responsibilities onto schools, such as providing lunch and even breakfast for
students? How does the creation of after-school care programs shift resources away from
traditional academics?
As these examples show, sociologists study many real-world topics. Their research often
influences social policies and political issues. Results from sociological studies on this topic might
play a role in developing federal laws like the Family and Medical Leave Act, or they might
bolster the efforts of an advocacy group striving to reduce social stigmas placed on stay-at-home
dads, or they might help governments determine how to best allocate funding for education.

CHAPTER 1 | AN INTRODUCTION TO SOCIOLOGY

1.3 Theoretical Perspectives

Figure 1.7 Sociologists develop theories to explain social occurrences such as protest rallies. (Photo courtesy of
voanews.com/Wikimedia Commons)
Sociologists study social events, interactions, and patterns. They then develop theories to explain why
these occur and what can result from them. In sociology, a theory is a way to explain different aspects
of social interactions and to create testable propositions about society (Allan 2006).
For example, early in the development of sociology, Émile Durkheim was interested in explaining
the social phenomenon of suicide. He gathered data on large groups of people in Europe who had ended
their lives. When he analyzed the data, he found that suicide rates differed among groups with different
religious affiliations. For example, the data showed that Protestants were more likely to commit suicide
than Catholics.
To explain this, Durkheim developed the concept of social solidarity. Social solidarity described
the social ties that bind a group of people together such as kinship, shared location, or religion.
Durkheim combined these concepts with the data he analyzed to propose a theory that explained the
religion-based differences in suicide rates. He suggested that differences in social solidarity between the
two groups corresponded to the differences in suicide rates.
Although some have disagreed with his methods and his conclusions, Durkheim's work shows the
importance of theory in sociology. Proposing theories supported by data gives sociologists a way to
explain social patterns and to posit cause-and-effect relationships in social situations.
Theories vary in scope depending on the scale of the issues they are meant to explain. Grand
theories, also described as macro-level, are attempts to explain large-scale relationships and answer
fundamental questions such as why societies form and why they change. These theories tend to be
abstract and can be difficult if not impossible to test empirically. Micro-level theories are at the other
end of the scale and cover very specific relationships between individuals or small groups. They are
dependent on their context and are more concrete. This means they are more scientifically testable.
An example of a micro-theory would be a theory to explain why middle-class teenage girls text to
communicate instead of making telephone calls. A sociologist might develop a hypothesis that the
reason they do this is because they think texting is silent and therefore more private. A sociologist
might then conduct interviews or design a survey to test this hypothesis. If there is enough supportive
data, a hypothesis can become a theory.
Sociological theory is constantly evolving and should never be considered complete. Classic
sociological theories are still considered important and current, but new sociological theories build
upon the work of their predecessors and add to them (Calhoun 2002).
In sociology, a few theories provide broad perspectives that help to explain many different aspects
of social life. These theories are so prominent that many consider them paradigms. Paradigms are
philosophical and theoretical frameworks used within a discipline to formulate theories, generalizations,
and the experiments performed in support of them. Three of these paradigms have come to dominate
sociological thinking because they provide useful explanations: structural functionalism, conflict
theory, and symbolic interactionism.

Functionalism
Functionalism, also called structural functional theory, sees society as a structure with interrelated
parts designed to meet the biological and social needs of individuals who make up that society. It is the
oldest of the main theories of sociology. In fact, its origins began before sociology emerged as a formal
discipline. It grew out of the writings of English philosopher and biologist Herbert Spencer
(1820–1903) who likened society to a human body. He argued that just as the various organs in the
body work together to keep the entire system functioning and regulated, the various parts of society
work together to keep the entire society functioning and regulated (Spencer 1898). By parts of society,
Spencer was referring to such social institutions as the economy, political systems, healthcare,
education, media, and religion. Spencer continued the analogy by pointing out that societies evolve just
as the bodies of humans and other animals do (Maryanski and Turner 1992).
One of the founders of sociology, Emile Durkheim, applied Spencer’s analogy to explain the
structure of societies and how they change and survive over time. Durkheim believed that earlier, more
primitive societies were held together because most people performed similar tasks and shared values,
language, and symbols. They exchanged goods and services in similar ways. Modern societies,
according to Durkheim, were more complex. People served many different functions in society and
their ability to carry out their function depended upon others being able to carry out theirs. Durkheim's
theory sees society as a complex system of interrelated parts, working together to maintain stability
(Durkheim 1893). According to this sociological viewpoint, the parts of society are interdependent.
This means each part influences the others. In a healthy society, all of these parts work together to
produce a stable state called dynamic equilibrium (Parsons 1961).
Durkheim believed that individuals may make up society, but in order to study society, sociologists
have to look beyond individuals to social facts. Social facts are the laws, morals, values, religious
beliefs, customs, fashions, rituals, and all of the cultural rules that govern social life (Durkheim 1895).
Each of these social facts serves one or more functions within a society. For example, one function of a
society’s laws may be to protect society from violence, while another is to punish criminal behavior,
while another is to preserve public health.
The English sociologist Alfred Radcliffe-Brown (1881–1955) shared Comte's and Durkheim's
views. He believed that how these functions worked together to maintain a stable society was controlled
by laws that could be discovered though systematic comparison (Broce 1973). Like Durkheim, he
argued that explanations of social interactions had to be made at the social level and not involve the
wants and needs of individuals (Goldschmidt 1996). He defined the function of any recurrent activity
as the part it plays in the social life as a whole, and thereby, the contribution it makes to structural
continuity (Radcliffe-Brown 1952).
Another noted structural functionalist, Robert Merton (1910–2003), pointed out that social
processes often have many functions. Manifest functions are the consequences of a social process that
are sought or anticipated, while latent functions are the unsought consequences of a social process. A
manifest function of college education, for example, includes gaining knowledge, preparing for a
career, and finding a good job that utilizes that education. Latent functions of your college years include
meeting new people, participating in extracurricular activities, or even finding a spouse or partner.
Another latent function of education is creating a hierarchy of employment based on the level of
education attained. Latent functions can be beneficial, neutral, or harmful. Social processes that have
undesirable consequences for the operation of society are called dysfunctions. In education, examples
of dysfunction include getting bad grades, truancy, dropping out, not graduating, and not finding
suitable employment.

CHAPTER 1 | AN INTRODUCTION TO SOCIOLOGY

Criticism
Structural-functionalism was the sociological paradigm that prevailed between World War II and the
Vietnam War. Its influence declined in the 1960s and 1970s because many sociologists believed that it
could not adequately explain the many rapid social changes taking place at the time. Many sociologists
now believe that structural functionalism is no longer useful as a macro-level theory, but that it does
serve as useful purpose in many mid-range analyses.

Big Picture

A Global Culture?

Figure 1.8 Some sociologists see the online world contributing to the creation of an emerging global culture. Are you
a part of any global communities? (Photo courtesy of quasireversible/flickr)
Sociologists around the world are looking closely for signs of what would be an unprecedented
event: the emergence of a global culture. In the past, empires such as those that existed in China,
Europe, Africa, and Central and South America linked people from many different countries, but
those people rarely became part of a common culture. They lived too far from each other, spoke
different languages, practiced different religions, and traded few goods. Today, increases in
communication, travel, and trade have made the world a much smaller place. More and more
people are able to communicate with each other instantly—wherever they are located—by
telephone, video, and text. They share movies, television shows, music, games, and information
over the internet. Students can study with teachers and pupils from the other side of the globe.
Governments find it harder to hide conditions inside their countries from the rest of the world.
Sociologists are researching many different aspects of this potential global culture. Some are
exploring the dynamics involved in the social interactions of global online communities, such as
when members feel a closer kinship to other group members than to people residing in their own
country. Other sociologists are studying the impact this growing international culture has on
smaller, less-powerful local cultures. Yet other researchers are exploring how international markets
and the outsourcing of labor impact social inequalities. Sociology can play a key role in people's
ability to understand the nature of this emerging global culture and how to respond to it.

Conflict Theory
Another theory with a macro-level view, called conflict theory, looks at society as a competition for
limited resources. Conflict theory sees society as being made up of individuals who must compete for
social, political, and material resources such as political power, leisure time, money, housing, and
entertainment. Social structures and organizations such as religious groups, governments, and
corporations reflect this competition in their inherent inequalities. Some individuals and organizations
are able to obtain and keep more resources than others. These "winners" use their power and influence

19

20

CHAPTER 1 | AN INTRODUCTION TO SOCIOLOGY

to maintain their positions of power in society and to suppress the advancement of other individuals and
groups. Of the early founders of sociology, Karl Marx is most closely identified with this theory. He
focused on the economic conflict between different social classes. As he and Fredrick Engels famously
described in their Communist Manifesto, “the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of
class struggles. Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman,
in a word, oppressor and oppressed” (1848).
Developing on this foundation, Polish-Austrian sociologist Ludwig Gumplowicz (1838–1909)
expanded on Marx’s ideas to develop his own version of conflict theory, adding his knowledge about
how civilizations evolve. In Outlines of Sociology (1884), he argues that war and conquest are the basis
on which civilizations have been shaped. He believed that cultural and ethnic conflicts led to states
being identified and defined by a dominant group that had power over other groups (Irving 2007).
The German sociologist Max Weber agreed with Marx that the economic inequalities of the
capitalist system were a source of widespread conflict. However, he disagreed that the conflict must
lead to revolution and the collapse of capitalism. Weber theorized that there was more than one cause
for conflict: besides economics, inequalities could exist over political power and social status. The level
of inequalities could also be different for different groups based on education, race, or gender. As long
as these conflicts remained separate, the system as a whole was not threatened.
Weber also identified several factors that moderated people's reaction to inequality. If the authority
of the people in power was considered legitimate by those over whom they had power, then conflicts
were less intense. Other moderating factors were high rates of social mobility and low rates of class
difference.
Another German sociologist, Georg Simmel (1858–1918), wrote that conflict can in fact help
integrate and stabilize a society. Like Weber, Simmel said that the nature of social conflict was highly
variable. The intensity and violence of the conflict depended upon the emotional involvement of the
different sides, the degree of solidarity among the opposing groups, and if there were clear and limited
goals to be achieved. Simmel also said that frequent smaller conflicts would be less violent that a few
large conflicts.
Simmel also studied how conflict changes the parties involved. He showed that groups work to
increase their internal solidarity, centralize power, reduce dissent, and become less tolerant of those not
in the group during conflict. Resolving conflicts can release tension and hostility and pave the way for
future agreements.
More recently, conflict theory has been used to explain inequalities between groups based on
gender or race. Janet Saltzman Chafetz (1941–2006) was a leader in the field of feminist conflict
theory. Her books Masculine/Feminine or Human (1974), Feminist Sociology (1988), and Gender
Equity (1990) and other studies Dr. Chafetz uses conflict theory to present a set of models to explain the
forces maintaining a system of gender inequality as well as a theory of how such a system can be
changed. She argues that two types of forces sustain a system of gender inequality. One type of force is
coercive and is based on the advantages men have in finding, keeping, and advancing in positions
within the workforce. The other depends on the voluntary choices individuals make based on the gender
roles that have been passed down through their families. Chafetz argues that the system can be changed
through changes in the number and types of jobs available to increasingly large numbers of welleducated women entering the workforce (Turner 2003).
Criticism
Just as structural functionalism was criticized for focusing too much on the stability of societies,
conflict theory has been criticized because it tends to focus on conflict to the exclusion of recognizing
stability. Many social structures are extremely stable or have gradually progressed over time rather than
changing abruptly as conflict theory would suggest.

Farming and Locavores: How Sociological
Perspectives Might View Food Consumption
The consumption of food is a commonplace, daily occurrence, yet it can also be associated with
important moments in our lives. Eating can be an individual or a group action, and eating habits
and customs are influenced by our cultures. In the context of society, our nation’s food system is at
the core of numerous social movements, political issues, and economic debates. Any of these
factors might become a topic of sociological study.
A structural-functional approach to the topic of food consumption might be interested in the
role of the agriculture industry within the nation’s economy and how this has changed from the
early days of manual-labor farming to modern mechanized production. Another examination might
study the different functions that occur in food production: from farming and harvesting to flashy
packaging and mass consumerism.
A conflict theorist might be interested in the power differentials present in the regulation of
food, exploring where people’s right to information intersects with corporations’ drive for profit
and how the government mediates those interests. Or a conflict theorist might be interested in the
power and powerlessness experienced by local farmers versus large farming conglomerates, such
as the documentary Food Inc. depicts as resulting from Monsanto’s patenting of seed technology.
Another topic of study might be how nutrition varies between different social classes.
A sociologist viewing food consumption through a symbolic interactionist lens would be
more interested in micro-level topics, such as the symbolic use of food in religious rituals, or the
role it plays in the social interaction of a family dinner. This perspective might also study the
interactions among group members who identify themselves based on their sharing a particular
diet, such as vegetarians (people who don’t eat meat) or locavores (people who strive to eat locally
produced food).

Symbolic InteractionistTheory
Symbolic Interactionism provides a theoretical perspective that helps scholars examine the
relationship of individuals within their society. This perspective is centered on the notion that
communication—or the exchange of meaning through language and symbols—is how people make
sense of their social worlds. As pointed out by Herman and Reynolds (1994), this viewpoint sees people
as active in shaping their world, rather than as entities who are acted upon by society (Herman and
Reynolds 1994). This approach looks at society and people from a micro-level perspective.
George Herbert Mead (1863–1931) is considered one of the founders of symbolic interactionism,
though he never published his work on it (LaRossa & Reitzes 1993). It was up to his student Herbert
Blumer (1900–1987) to interpret Mead's work and popularize the theory. Blumer coined the term
“symbolic interactionism” and identified its three basic premises:
1. Humans act toward things on the basis of the meanings they ascribe to those things.
2. The meaning of such things is derived from, or arises out of, the social interaction that one has
with others and the society.
3. These meanings are handled in, and modified through, an interpretative process used by the person
in dealing with the things he/she encounters (Blumer 1969).
Social scientists who apply symbolic-interactionist thinking look for patterns of interaction
between individuals. Their studies often involve observation of one-on-one interactions. For example,
while a conflict theorist studying a political protest might focus on class difference, a symbolic
interactionist would be more interested in how individuals in the protesting group interact, as well as
the signs and symbols protesters use to communicate their message. The focus on the importance of
symbols in building a society led sociologists like Erving Goffman (1922-1982) to develop a technique
called dramaturgical analysis. Goffman used theater as an analogy for social interaction and
recognized that people’s interactions showed patterns of cultural “scripts.” Because it can be unclear
what part a person may play in a given situation, he or she has to improvise his or her role as the
situation unfolds (Goffman 1958).

21

22

CHAPTER 1 | AN INTRODUCTION TO SOCIOLOGY

Studies that use the symbolic interactionist perspective are more likely to use qualitative research
methods, such as in-depth interviews or participant observation, because they seek to understand the
symbolic worlds in which research subjects live.
Criticism
Research done from this perspective is often scrutinized because of the difficulty of remaining
objective. Others criticize the extremely narrow focus on symbolic interaction. Proponents, of course,
consider this one of its greatest strengths.

1.4 Why Study Sociology?

Figure 1.9 The research of sociologists Kenneth and Mamie Clark helped the Supreme Court decide to end “separate but
equal” racial segregation in schools in the United States. (Photo courtesy of public domain)
When Elizabeth Eckford tried to enter Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, in September
1957, she was met by an angry crowd. But she knew she had the law on her side. Three years earlier in
the landmark Brown vs. the Board of Education case, the U.S. Supreme Court had overturned 21 state
laws that allowed blacks and whites to be taught in separate school systems as long as the school
systems were “equal.” One of the major factors influencing that decision was research conducted by the
husband-and-wife team of sociologists, Kenneth and Mamie Clark. Their research showed that
segregation was harmful to young black schoolchildren, and the Court found that harm to be
unconstitutional.
Since it was first founded, many people interested in sociology have been driven by the scholarly
desire to contribute knowledge to this field, while others have seen it as way not only to study society,
but also to improve it. Besides desegregation, sociology has played a crucial role in many important
social reforms such as equal opportunity for women in the workplace, improved treatment for
individuals with mental handicaps or learning disabilities, increased accessibility and accommodation
for people with physical handicaps, the right of native populations to preserve their land and culture,
and prison system reforms.
The prominent sociologist Peter L. Berger (1929– ), in his 1963 book Invitation to Sociology: A
Humanistic Perspective, describes a sociologist as "someone concerned with understanding society in a
disciplined way." He asserts that sociologists have a natural interest in the monumental moments of
people’s lives, as well as a fascination with banal, everyday occurrences. Berger also describes the
“aha” moment when a sociological theory becomes applicable and understood:
[T]here is a deceptive simplicity and obviousness about some sociological
investigations. One reads them, nods at the familiar scene, remarks that one has
heard all this before and don't people have better things to do than to waste their
time on truisms—until one is suddenly brought up against an insight that radically
questions everything one had previously assumed about this familiar scene. This is
the point at which one begins to sense the excitement of sociology. (Berger 1963)
Sociology can be exciting because it teaches people ways to recognize how they fit into the world
and how others perceive them. Looking at themselves and society from a sociological perspective helps
people see where they connect to different groups based on the many different ways they classify
themselves and how society classifies them in turn. It raises awareness of how those
classifications—such as economic and status levels, education, ethnicity, or sexual orientation—affect
perceptions.

CHAPTER 1 | AN INTRODUCTION TO SOCIOLOGY

Sociology teaches people not to accept easy explanations. It teaches them a way to organize their
thinking so that they can ask better questions and formulate better answers. It makes people more aware
that there are many different kinds of people in the world who do not necessarily think the way they do.
It increases their willingness and ability to try to see the world from other people's perspectives. This
prepares them to live and work in an increasingly diverse and integrated world.

Sociology in the Workplace
Employers continue to seek people with what are called “transferable skills.” This means that they want
to hire people whose knowledge and education can be applied in a variety of settings and whose skills
will contribute to various tasks. Studying sociology can provide people with this wide knowledge and a
skill set that can contribute to many workplaces, including:
• an understanding of social systems and large bureaucracies,
• the ability to devise and carry out research projects to assess whether a program or
policy is working,
• the ability to collect, read, and analyze statistical information from polls or surveys,
• the ability to recognize important differences in people’s social, cultural, and economic
backgrounds,
• skills in preparing reports and communicating complex ideas,
• the capacity for critical thinking about social issues and problems that confront
modern society. (Department of Sociology, University of Alabama)
Sociology prepares people for a wide variety of careers. Besides actually conducting social
research or training others in the field, people who graduate from college with a degree in sociology are
hired by government agencies and corporations in fields such as social services, counseling (e.g., family
planning, career, substance abuse), community planning, health services, marketing, market research,
and human resources. Even a small amount of training in sociology can be an asset in careers like sales,
public relations, journalism, teaching, law, and criminal justice.

Please “Friend” Me: Students and Social
Networking
The phenomenon known as Facebook was designed specifically for students. Whereas earlier
generations wrote notes in each other’s printed yearbooks at the end of the academic year, modern
technology and the internet ushered in dynamic new ways for people to interact socially. Instead of
having to meet up on campus, students can call, text, and Skype from their dorm rooms. Instead of
a study group gathering weekly in the library, online forums and chat rooms help learners connect.
The availability and immediacy of computer technology has forever changed the ways students
engage with each other.
Now, after several social networks have vied for primacy, a few have established their place
in the market and some have attracted niche audience. While Facebook launched the social
networking trend geared toward teens and young adults, now people of all ages are actively
“friending” each other. LinkedIn distinguished itself by focusing on professional connections,
serving as a virtual world for workplace networking. Newer offshoots like Foursquare help people
connect based on the real-world places they frequent, while Twitter has cornered the market on
brevity.
These newer modes of social interaction have also spawned harmful consequences, such as
cyberbullying and what some call FAD, or Facebook Addiction Disorder. Researchers have also
examined other potential negative impacts, such as whether Facebooking lowers a student’s GPA,
or whether there might be long-term effects of replacing face-to-face interaction with social media.
All of these social networks demonstrate emerging ways that people interact, whether positive
or negative. They illustrate how sociological topics are alive and changing today. Social media will
most certainly be a developing topic in the study of sociology for decades to come.

Section Summary
1.1 What Is Sociology?
Sociology is the systematic study of society and social interaction. In order to carry out their studies,
sociologists identify cultural patterns and social forces and determine how they affect individuals and
groups. They also develop ways to apply their findings to the real world.

1.2 The History of Sociology
Sociology was developed as a way to study and try to understand the changes to society brought on by
the Industrial Revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries. Some of the earliest sociologists thought that
societies and individuals’ roles in society could be studied using the same scientific methodologies that
were used in the natural sciences, while others believed that is was impossible to predict human
behavior scientifically, and still others debated the value of such predictions. Those perspectives
continue to be represented within sociology today.

1.3 Theoretical Perspectives
Sociologists develop theories to explain social events, interactions, and patterns. A theory is a proposed
explanation of those patterns. Theories have different scales. Macro-level theories, such as structural
functionalism and conflict theory, attempt to explain how societies operate as a whole. Micro-level
theories, such as symbolic interactionism, focus on interactions between individuals.

1.4 Why Study Sociology?
Studying sociology is beneficial both for the individual and for society. By studying sociology people
learn how to think critically about social issues and problems that confront our society. The study of
sociology enriches students’ lives and prepares them for careers in an increasingly diverse world.
Society benefits because people with sociological training are better prepared to make informed
decisions about social issues and take effective action to deal with them.

Introduction to Sociological Research
In the campus cafeteria, you set your lunch tray down at a table, grab a chair, join a group of your
college classmates, and hear the start of two discussions. One person says, “It’s weird how Jimmy
Buffett has so many devoted fans.” Another says, “Disney World is packed year-round.” Those two

31

32

CHAPTER 2 | SOCIOLOGICAL RESEARCH

seemingly benign statements are claims, or opinions, based on everyday observation of human
behavior. Perhaps the speakers had firsthand experience, talked to experts, conducted online research,
or saw news segments on TV.
In response, two conversations erupt.
“I don’t see why anyone would want to go to Disney World and stand in those long lines.”
“Are you kidding?! Going to Disney World is one of my favorite childhood memories.”
“It’s the opposite for me with Jimmy Buffett. After seeing one of his shows, I don’t need to go
again.”
“Yet some people make it a lifestyle.”
“A theme park is way different than a concert.”
“But both are places people go for the same thing: a good time.”
“If you call getting lost in a crowd of thousands of strangers fun.”
As your classmates at the lunch table discuss what they know or believe, the two topics converge.
The conversation becomes a debate. Someone compares Parrotheads to Packers fans. Someone else
compares Disney World to a cruise. Students take sides, agreeing or disagreeing, as the conversation
veers to topics such as crowd control, mob mentality, political protests, and group dynamics.
If you contributed your expanding knowledge of sociological research to this conversation, you
might make statements like these:
“Jimmy Buffett’s fans long for escapism. Parrotheads join together claiming they want freedom,
except they only want a temporary escape.”
And this: “Mickey Mouse is a symbol of America just like the Statue of Liberty. Disney World is a
place where families go to celebrate what they see as America.”
You finish lunch, clear away your tray, and hurry to your next class. But you are thinking of
Jimmy Buffett and Disney World. You have a new perspective on human behavior and a list of
questions that you want answered. That is the purpose of sociological research—to investigate and
provide insights into how human societies function. Although claims and opinions are part of sociology,
sociologists use empirical evidence (that is, evidence corroborated by direct experience and/or
observation) combined with the scientific method or an interpretive framework to deliver sound
sociological research. They also rely on a theoretical foundation that provides an interpretive
perspective through which they can make sense of scientific results.
A truly scientific sociological study of the social situations up for discussion in the cafeteria would
involve these prescribed steps: defining a specific question, gathering information and resources
through observation, forming a hypothesis, testing the hypothesis in a reproducible manner, analyzing
and drawing conclusions from the data, publishing the results, and anticipating further development
when future researchers respond to and retest findings. An appropriate starting point in this case might
be the question "What do fans of Jimmy Buffett seek that drives them to attend his concerts faithfully?"
As you begin to think like a sociologist, you may notice that you have tapped into your
observation skills. You might assume that your observations and insights are valuable and accurate. But
the results of casual observation are limited by the fact that there is no standardization—who is to say
one person’s observation of an event is any more accurate than another’s? To mediate these concerns,
sociologists rely on systematic research processes.

2.1 Approaches to Sociological Research
When sociologists apply the sociological perspective and begin to ask questions, no topic is off limits.
Every aspect of human behavior is a source of possible investigation. Sociologists question the world
that humans have created and live in. They notice patterns of behavior as people move through that
world. Using sociological methods and systematic research within the framework of the scientific
method and a scholarly interpretive perspective, sociologists have discovered workplace patterns that
have transformed industries, family patterns that have enlightened parents, and education patterns that
have aided structural changes in classrooms.
The students at that college cafeteria discussion put forth a few loosely stated opinions. If the
human behaviors around those claims were tested systematically, a student could write a report and
offer the findings to fellow sociologists and the world in general. The new perspective could help
people understand themselves and their neighbors and help people make better decisions about their

CHAPTER 2 | SOCIOLOGICAL RESEARCH

lives. It might seem strange to use scientific practices to study social trends, but, as we shall see, it’s
extremely helpful to rely on systematic approaches that research methods provide.
Sociologists often begin the research process by asking a question about how or why things
happen in this world. It might be a unique question about a new trend or an old question about a
common aspect of life. Once a question is formed, a sociologist proceeds through an in-depth process to
answer it. In deciding how to design that process, the researcher may adopt a scientific approach or an
interpretive framework. The following sections describe these approaches to knowledge.

The Scientific Method
Sociologists make use of tried and true methods of research, such as experiments, surveys, and field
research. But humans and their social interactions are so diverse that they can seem impossible to chart
or explain. It might seem that science is about discoveries and chemical reactions or about proving
ideas right or wrong rather than about exploring the nuances of human behavior.
However, this is exactly why scientific models work for studying human behavior. A scientific
process of research establishes parameters that help make sure results are objective and accurate.
Scientific methods provide limitations and boundaries that focus a study and organize its results.
The scientific method involves developing and testing theories about the world based on empirical
evidence. It is defined by its commitment to systematic observation of the empirical world and strives
to be objective, critical, skeptical, and logical. It involves a series of prescribed steps that have been
established over centuries of scholarship.

Figure 2.2 The scientific method is an essential tool in research.
But just because sociological studies use scientific methods does not make the results less human.
Sociological topics are not reduced to right or wrong facts. In this field, results of studies tend to
provide people with access to knowledge they did not have before—knowledge of other cultures,
knowledge of rituals and beliefs, knowledge of trends and attitudes. No matter what research approach
is used, researchers want to maximize the study’s reliability (how likely research results are to be
replicated if the study is reproduced). Reliability increases the likelihood that what happens to one
person will happen to all people in a group. Researchers also strive for validity, which refers to how
well the study measures what it was designed to measure. Returning to the Disney World topic,
reliability of a study would reflect how well the resulting experience represents the average experience
of theme park-goers. Validity would ensure that the study’s design accurately examined what it was
designed to study, so an exploration of adults’ interactions with costumed mascots should address that
issue and not veer into other age groups’ interactions with them or into adult interactions with staff or
other guests.
In general, sociologists tackle questions about the role of social characteristics in outcomes. For
example, how do different communities fare in terms of psychological well-being, community
cohesiveness, range of vocation, wealth, crime rates, and so on? Are communities functioning
smoothly? Sociologists look between the cracks to discover obstacles to meeting basic human needs.
They might study environmental influences and patterns of behavior that lead to crime, substance

CHAPTER 2 | SOCIOLOGICAL RESEARCH

abuse, divorce, poverty, unplanned pregnancies, or illness. And, because sociological studies are not all
focused on negative behaviors or challenging situations, researchers might study vacation trends,
healthy eating habits, neighborhood organizations, higher education patterns, games, parks, and
exercise habits.
Sociologists can use the scientific method not only to collect but to interpret and analyze the data.
They deliberately apply scientific logic and objectivity. They are interested in but not attached to the
results. They work outside of their own political or social agenda. This doesn’t mean researchers do not
have their own personalities, complete with preferences and opinions. But sociologists deliberately use
the scientific method to maintain as much objectivity, focus, and consistency as possible in a particular
study.
With its systematic approach, the scientific method has proven useful in shaping sociological
studies. The scientific method provides a systematic, organized series of steps that help ensure
objectivity and consistency in exploring a social problem. They provide the means for accuracy,
reliability, and validity. In the end, the scientific method provides a shared basis for discussion and
analysis (Merton 1963).
Typically, the scientific method starts with these steps—1) ask a question, 2) research existing
sources, 3) formulate a hypothesis—described below.
Ask a Question
The first step of the scientific method is to ask a question, describe a problem, and identify the specific
area of interest. The topic should be narrow enough to study within a geography and timeframe. “Are
societies capable of sustained happiness?” would be too vague. The question should also be broad
enough to have universal merit. “What do personal hygiene habits reveal about the values of students at
XYZ High School?” would be too narrow. That said, happiness and hygiene are worthy topics to study.
Sociologists do not rule out any topic, but would strive to frame these questions in better research
terms.
That is why sociologists are careful to define their terms. In a hygiene study, for instance, hygiene
could be defined as “personal habits to maintain physical appearance (as opposed to health),” and a
researcher might ask, “How do differing personal hygiene habits reflect the cultural value placed on
appearance?” When forming these basic research questions, sociologists develop an operational
definition, that is, they define the concept in terms of the physical or concrete steps it takes to
objectively measure it. The operational definition identifies an observable condition of the concept. By
operationalizing a variable of the concept, all researchers can collect data in a systematic or replicable
manner.
The operational definition must be valid, appropriate, and meaningful. And it must be reliable,
meaning that results will be close to uniform when tested on more than one person. For example, “good
drivers” might be defined in many ways: those who use their turn signals, those who don’t speed, or
those who courteously allow others to merge. But these driving behaviors could be interpreted
differently by different researchers and could be difficult to measure. Alternatively, “a driver who has
never received a traffic violation” is a specific description that will lead researchers to obtain the same
information, so it is an effective operational definition.
Research Existing Sources
The next step researchers undertake is to conduct background research through a literature review,
which is a review of any existing similar or related studies. A visit to the library and a thorough online
search will uncover existing research about the topic of study. This step helps researchers gain a broad
understanding of work previously conducted on the topic at hand and enables them to position their
own research to build on prior knowledge. Researchers—including student researchers—are
responsible for correctly citing existing sources they use in a study or that inform their work. While it is
fine to borrow previously published material (as long as it enhances a unique viewpoint), it must be
referenced properly and never plagiarized.
To study hygiene and its value in a particular society, a researcher might sort through existing
research and unearth studies about child-rearing, vanity, obsessive-compulsive behaviors, and cultural
attitudes toward beauty. It’s important to sift through this information and determine what is relevant.
Using existing sources educates a researcher and helps refine and improve a study’s design.
Formulate a Hypothesis
A hypothesis is an assumption about how two or more variables are related; it makes a conjectural
statement about the relationship between those variables. In sociology, the hypothesis will often predict

CHAPTER 2 | SOCIOLOGICAL RESEARCH

how one form of human behavior influences another. In research, independent variables are the cause
of the change. The dependent variable is the effect, or thing that is changed.
For example, in a basic study, the researcher would establish one form of human behavior as the
independent variable and observe the influence it has on a dependent variable. How does gender (the
independent variable) affect rate of income (the dependent variable)? How does one’s religion (the
independent variable) affect family size (the dependent variable)? How is social class (the dependent
variable) affected by level of education (the independent variable)?
Table 2.1 Examples of Dependent and Independent Variables Typically, the independent
variable causes the dependent variable to change in some way.

At this point, a researcher’s operational definitions help measure the variables. In a study asking
how tutoring improves grades, for instance, one researcher might define “good” grades as a C or better,
while another uses a B+ as a starting point for “good.” Another operational definition might describe
“tutoring” as “one-on-one assistance by an expert in the field, hired by an educational institution.”
Those definitions set limits and establish cut-off points, ensuring consistency and replicability in a
study.
As the chart shows, an independent variable is the one that causes a dependent variable to change.
For example, a researcher might hypothesize that teaching children proper hygiene (the independent
variable) will boost their sense of self-esteem (the dependent variable). Or rephrased, a child’s sense of
self-esteem depends, in part, on the quality and availability of hygienic resources.
Of course, this hypothesis can also work the other way around. Perhaps a sociologist believes that
increasing a child’s sense of self-esteem (the independent variable) will automatically increase or
improve habits of hygiene (now the dependent variable). Identifying the independent and dependent
variables is very important. As the hygiene example shows, simply identifying two topics, or variables,
is not enough: Their prospective relationship must be part of the hypothesis.
Just because a sociologist forms an educated prediction of a study’s outcome doesn’t mean data
contradicting the hypothesis aren’t welcome. Sociologists analyze general patterns in response to a
study, but they are equally interested in exceptions to patterns. In a study of education, a researcher
might predict that high school dropouts have a hard time finding a rewarding career. While it has
become at least a cultural assumption that the higher the education, the higher the salary and degree of
career happiness, there are certainly exceptions. People with little education have had stunning careers,
and people with advanced degrees have had trouble finding work. A sociologist prepares a hypothesis
knowing that results will vary.
Once the preliminary work is done, it’s time for the next research steps: designing and conducting
a study, and drawing conclusions. These research methods are discussed below.

Interpretive Framework
While many sociologists rely on the scientific method as a research approach, others operate from an
interpretive framework. While systematic, this approach doesn’t follow the hypothesis-testing model
that seeks to find generalizable results. Instead, an interpretive framework, sometimes referred to as an
interpretive perspective, seeks to understand social worlds from the point of view of participants,
leading to in-depth knowledge.

35

36

CHAPTER 2 | SOCIOLOGICAL RESEARCH

Interpretive research is generally more descriptive or narrative in its findings. Rather than
formulating a hypothesis and method for testing it, an interpretive researcher will develop approaches to
explore the topic at hand that may involve lots of direct observation or interaction with subjects. This
type of researcher also learns as he or she proceeds, sometimes adjusting the research methods or
processes midway to optimize findings as they evolve.

2.2 Research Methods
Sociologists examine the world, see a problem or interesting pattern, and set out to study it. They use
research methods to design a study—perhaps a detailed, systematic, scientific method for conducting
research and obtaining data, or perhaps an ethnographic study utilizing an interpretive framework.
Planning the research design is a key step in any sociological study.
When entering a particular social environment, a researcher must be careful. There are times to
remain anonymous and times to be overt. There are times to conduct interviews and times to simply
observe. Some participants need to be thoroughly informed; others should not know they are being
observed. A researcher wouldn’t stroll into a crime-ridden neighborhood at midnight, calling out, “Any
gang members around?” And if a researcher walked into a coffee shop and told the employees they
would be observed as part of a study on work efficiency, the self-conscious, intimidated baristas might
not behave naturally.
In the 1920s, leaders of a Chicago factory called Hawthorne Works commissioned a study to
determine whether or not lighting could increase or decrease worker productivity. Sociologists were
brought in. Changes were made. Productivity increased. Results were published.
But when the study was over, productivity dropped again. Why did this happen? In 1953, Henry A.
Landsberger analyzed the study results to answer this question. He realized that employee productivity
increased because sociologists were paying attention to them. The sociologists’ presence influenced the
study results. Worker behaviors were altered not by the lighting but by the study itself. From this,
sociologists learned the importance of carefully planning their roles as part of their research design
(Franke and Kaul 1978).
Landsberger called the workers’ response the Hawthorne effect—people changing their behavior
because they know they are being watched as part of a study. The Hawthorne effect is unavoidable in
some research. In many cases, sociologists have to make the purpose of the study known. Subjects must
be aware that they are being observed, and a certain amount of artificiality may result (Sonnenfeld
1985).
Making sociologists’ presence invisible is not always realistic for other reasons. That option is not
available to a researcher studying prison behaviors, early education, or the Ku Klux Klan. Researchers
can’t just stroll into prisons, kindergarten classrooms, or Klan meetings and unobtrusively observe
behaviors. In situations like these, other methods are needed. All studies shape the research design,
while research design simultaneously shapes the study. Researchers choose methods that best suit their
study topic and that fit with their overall approach to research.
In planning a study’s design, sociologists generally choose from four widely used methods of
social investigation: survey, field research, experiment, and secondary data analysis (or use of existing
sources). Every research method comes with plusses and minuses, and the topic of study strongly
influences which method or methods are put to use.

Surveys
As a research method, a survey collects data from subjects who respond to a series of questions about
behaviors and opinions, often in the form of a questionnaire. The survey is one of the most widely used
scientific research methods. The standard survey format allows individuals a level of anonymity in
which they can express personal ideas.

CHAPTER 2 | SOCIOLOGICAL RESEARCH

Figure 2.3 Questionnaires are a common research method; the U.S. Census is a well-known example. (Photo courtesy of
Karen Horton/flickr)
At some point or another, everyone responds to some type of survey. The United States Census is
an excellent example of a large-scale survey intended to gather sociological data. Customers fill out
questionnaires at stores or promotional events, responding to questions such as “How did you hear
about the event?” and “Were the staff helpful?” You’ve probably picked up the phone and heard a caller
ask you to participate in a political poll or similar type of survey. “Do you eat hot dogs? If yes, how
many per month?”
Not all surveys would be considered sociological research. Marketing polls help companies refine
marketing goals and strategies; they are generally not conducted as part of a scientific study, meaning
they are not designed to test a hypothesis or to contribute knowledge to the field of sociology. The
results are not published in a refereed scholarly journal, where design, methodology, results, and
analyses are vetted. Often, polls on TV do not reflect a general population, but are merely answers from
a specific show’s audience. Polls conducted by programs such as American Idol or So You Think You
Can Dance represent the opinions of fans but are not particularly scientific. A good contrast to these are
the Nielsen Ratings, which determine the popularity of television programming through scientific
market research.

experienced in Somalia. Participants submitted a blood sample as part of this study, which supported Operation Restore Hope.

Sociologists conduct surveys under controlled conditions for specific purposes. Surveys gather
different types of information from people. While surveys are not great at capturing the ways people
really behave in social situations, they are a great method for discovering how people feel and
think—or at least how they say they feel and think. Surveys can track preferences for presidential
candidates or reported individual behaviors (such as sleeping, driving, or texting habits), or factual
information such as employment status, income, and education levels.
A survey targets a specific population, people who are the focus of a study, such as college
athletes, international students, or teenagers living with type 1 (juvenile-onset) diabetes. Most
researchers choose to survey a small sector of the population, or a sample: that is, a manageable

37

38

CHAPTER 2 | SOCIOLOGICAL RESEARCH

number of subjects who represent a larger population. The success of a study depends on how well a
population is represented by the sample. In a random sample, every person in a population has the
same chance of being chosen for the study. According to the laws of probability, random samples
represent the population as a whole. For instance, a Gallup Poll, if conducted as a nationwide random
sampling, should be able to provide an accurate estimate of public opinion whether it contacts 2,000 or
10,000 people.
After selecting subjects, the researcher develops a specific plan to ask questions and record
responses. It is important to inform subjects of the nature and purpose of the study up front. If they
agree to participate, researchers thank subjects and offer them a chance to see the results of the study if
they are interested. The researcher presents the subjects with an instrument, a means of gathering the
information. A common instrument is a questionnaire, in which subjects answer a series of questions.
For some topics, the researcher might ask yes-or-no or multiple-choice questions, allowing subjects to
choose possible responses to each question. This kind of quantitative data—research collected in
numerical form that can be counted—are easy to tabulate. Just count up the number of “yes” and “no”
responses or correct answers and chart them into percentages.
Questionnaires can also ask more complex questions with more complex answers—beyond “yes,”
“no,” or the option next to a checkbox. In those cases, the answers are subjective, varying from person
to person. How do plan to use your college education? Why do you follow Jimmy Buffett around the
country and attend every concert? Those types of questions require short essay responses, and
participants willing to take the time to write those answers will convey personal information about
religious beliefs, political views, and morals. Some topics that reflect internal thought are impossible to
observe directly and are difficult to discuss honestly in a public forum. People are more likely to share
honest answers if they can respond to questions anonymously. This type of information is qualitative
data—results that are subjective and often based on what is seen in a natural setting. Qualitative
information is harder to organize and tabulate. The researcher will end up with a wide range of
responses, some of which may be surprising. The benefit of written opinions, though, is the wealth of
material that they provide.
An interview is a one-on-one conversation between the researcher and the subject, and is a way of
conducting surveys on a topic. Interviews are similar to the short answer questions on surveys in that
the researcher asks subjects a series of questions. However, participants are free to respond as they
wish, without being limited by predetermined choices. In the back-and-forth conversation of an
interview, a researcher can ask for clarification, spend more time on a subtopic, or ask additional
questions. In an interview, a subject will ideally feel free to open up and answer questions that are often
complex. There are no right or wrong answers. The subject might not even know how to answer the
questions honestly.
Questions such as “How did society's view of alcohol consumption influence your decision
whether or not to take your first sip of alcohol?” or “Did you feel that the divorce of your parents would
put a social stigma on your family?” involve so many factors that the answers are difficult to categorize.
A researcher needs to avoid steering or prompting the subject to respond in a specific way; otherwise,
the results will prove to be unreliable. And, obviously, a sociological interview is not an interrogation.
The researcher will benefit from gaining a subject’s trust, from empathizing or commiserating with a
subject, and from listening without judgment.

Field Research
The work of sociology rarely happens in limited, confined spaces. Sociologists seldom study subjects in
their own offices or laboratories. Rather, sociologists go out into the world. They meet subjects where
they live, work, and play. Field research refers to gathering primary data from a natural environment
without doing a lab experiment or a survey. It is a research method suited to an interpretive framework
rather than to the scientific method. To conduct field research, the sociologist must be willing to step
into new environments and observe, participate, or experience those worlds. In field work, the
sociologists, rather than the subjects, are the ones out of their element.
The researcher interacts with or observes a person or people, gathering data along the way. The
key point in field research is that it takes place in the subject’s natural environment, whether it’s a
coffee shop or tribal village, a homeless shelter or the DMV, a hospital, airport, mall, or beach resort.

natural environments. (Photo courtesy of IMLS Digital Collections and Content/flickr and Olympic National Park)
While field research often begins in a specific setting, the study’s purpose is to observe specific
behaviors in that setting. Field work is optimal for observing how people behave. It is less useful,
however, for understanding why they behave that way. You can't really narrow down cause and effect
when there are so many variables floating around in a natural environment.
Much of the data gathered in field research are based not on cause and effect but on correlation.
And while field research looks for correlation, its small sample size does not allow for establishing a
causal relationship between two variables.

CHAPTER 2 | SOCIOLOGICAL RESEARCH

Some sociologists study small groups of people who share an identity in one aspect of their lives.
Almost everyone belongs to a group of like-minded people who share an interest or hobby.
Scientologists, folk dancers, or members of Mensa (an organization for people with exceptionally
high IQs) express a specific part of their identity through their affiliation with a group. Those
groups are often of great interest to sociologists.
Jimmy Buffett, an American musician who built a career from his single top-10 song
“Margaritaville,” has a following of devoted groupies called Parrotheads. Some of them have
taken fandom to the extreme, making Parrothead culture a lifestyle. In 2005, Parrotheads and their
subculture caught the attention of researchers John Mihelich and John Papineau. The two saw the
way Jimmy Buffett fans collectively created an artificial reality. They wanted to know how fan
groups shape culture. The result was a study and resulting article called “Parrotheads in
Margaritaville: Fan Practice, Oppositional Culture, and Embedded Cultural Resistance in Buffett
Fandom.”
What Mihelich and Papineau found was that Parrotheads, for the most part, do not seek to
challenge or even change society, as many sub-groups do. In fact, most Parrotheads live
successfully within society, holding upper-level jobs in the corporate world. What they seek is
escape from the stress of daily life. They get it from Jimmy Buffett’s concerts and from the public
image he projects. Buffett fans collectively keep their version of an alternate reality alive.
At Jimmy Buffett concerts, Parrotheads engage in a form of role play. They paint their faces
and dress for the tropics in grass skirts, Hawaiian leis, and Parrot hats. These fans don’t generally
play the part of Parrotheads outside of these concerts; you are not likely to see a lone Parrothead in
a bank or library. In that sense, Parrothead culture is less about individualism and more about
conformity. Being a Parrothead means sharing a specific identity. Parrotheads feel connected to
each other: it’s a group identity, not an individual one.
On fan websites, followers conduct polls calling for responses to message-board prompts
such as “Why are you a Parrothead” and “Where is your Margaritaville?” To the latter question,
fans define the place as anywhere from a beach to a bar to a peaceful state of mind. Ultimately,
however, “Margaritaville” is an imaginary place.
In their study, Mihelich and Papineau quote from a recent book by sociologist Richard
Butsch, who writes, “un-self-conscious acts, if done by many people together, can produce change,
even though the change may be unintended” (2000). Many Parrothead fan groups have performed
good works in the name of Jimmy Buffett culture, donating to charities and volunteering their
services.
However, the authors suggest that what really drives Parrothead culture is commercialism.
Jimmy Buffett’s popularity was dying out in the 1980s until being reinvigorated after he signed a
sponsorship deal with a beer company. These days, his concert tours alone generate nearly $30
million a year. Buffett made a lucrative career for himself by partnering with product companies
and marketing Margaritaville in the form of T-shirts, restaurants, casinos, and an expansive line of
products. Some fans accuse Buffett of selling out, while others admire his financial success.
Buffett makes no secret of his commercial exploitations; from the stage, he’s been known to tell
his fans, “Just remember, I am spending your money foolishly.”
Mihelich and Papineau gathered much of their information online. Referring to their study as
a “Web ethnography,” they collected extensive narrative material from fans who joined Parrothead
clubs and posted their experiences on websites. “We do not claim to have conducted a complete
ethnography of Parrothead fans, or even of the Parrothead Web activity,” state the authors, “but we
focused on particular aspects of Parrothead practice as revealed through Web research” (2005).
Fan narratives gave them insight into how individuals identify with Buffett’s world and how fans
used popular music to cultivate personal and collective meaning.
In conducting studies about pockets of culture, most sociologists seek to discover a universal
appeal. Mihelich and Papineau stated, “Although Parrotheads are a relative minority of the
contemporary US population, an in-depth look at their practice and conditions illuminate [sic]
cultural practices and conditions many of us experience and participate in” (2005).
Here, we will look at three types of field research: participant observation, ethnography, and the
case study.

CHAPTER 2 | SOCIOLOGICAL RESEARCH

Participant Observation
In 2000, a comic writer named Rodney Rothman wanted an insider’s view of white-collar work. He
slipped into the sterile, high-rise offices of a New York “dot com” agency. Every day for two weeks, he
pretended to work there. His main purpose was simply to see if anyone would notice him or challenge
his presence. No one did. The receptionist greeted him. The employees smiled and said good morning.
Rothman was accepted as part of the team. He even went so far as to claim a desk, inform the
receptionist of his whereabouts, and attend a meeting. He published an article about his experience in
The New Yorker called “My Fake Job” (2000). Later, he was discredited for allegedly fabricating some
details of the story and The New Yorker issued an apology. However, Rothman’s entertaining article still
offered fascinating descriptions of the inside workings of a “dot com” company and exemplified the
lengths to which a sociologist will go to uncover material.
Rothman had conducted a form of study called participant observation, in which researchers join
people and participate in a group’s routine activities for the purpose of observing them within that
context. This method lets researchers experience a specific aspect of social life. A researcher might go
to great lengths to get a firsthand look into a trend, institution, or behavior. Researchers temporarily put
themselves into roles and record their observations. A researcher might work as a waitress in a diner, or
live as a homeless person for several weeks, or ride along with police officers as they patrol their
regular beat. Often, these researchers try to blend in seamlessly with the population they study, and they
may not disclose their true identity or purpose if they feel it would compromise the results of their
research.

At the beginning of a field study, researchers might have a question: “What really goes on in the
kitchen of the most popular diner on campus?” or “What is it like to be homeless?” Participant
observation is a useful method if the researcher wants to explore a certain environment from the inside.
Field researchers simply want to observe and learn. In such a setting, the researcher will be alert
and open minded to whatever happens, recording all observations accurately. Soon, as patterns emerge,
questions will become more specific, observations will lead to hypotheses, and hypotheses will guide
the researcher in shaping data into results.
In a study of small-town America conducted by sociological researchers John S. Lynd and Helen
Merrell Lynd, the team altered their purpose as they gathered data. They initially planned to focus their
study on the role of religion in American towns. As they gathered observations, they realized that the
effect of industrialization and urbanization was the more relevant topic of this social group. The Lynds
did not change their methods, but they revised their purpose. This shaped the structure of Middletown:
A Study in Modern American Culture, their published results (Lynd and Lynd 1959).
The Lynds were upfront about their mission. The townspeople of Muncie, Indiana, knew why the
researchers were in their midst. But some sociologists prefer not to alert people to their presence. The
main advantage of covert participant observation is that it allows the researcher access to authentic,
natural behaviors of a group’s members. The challenge, however, is gaining access to a setting without
disrupting the pattern of others’ behavior. Becoming an inside member of a group, organization, or
subculture takes time and effort. Researchers must pretend to be something they are not. The process
could involve role playing, making contacts, networking, or applying for a job.

CHAPTER 2 | SOCIOLOGICAL RESEARCH

Once inside a group, some researchers spend months or even years pretending to be one of the
people they are observing. However, as observers, they cannot get too involved. They must keep their
purpose in mind and apply the sociological perspective. That way, they illuminate social patterns that
are often unrecognized. Because information gathered during participant observation is mostly
qualitative, rather than quantitative, the end results are often descriptive or interpretive. The researcher
might present findings in an article or book, describing what he or she witnessed and experienced.
This type of research is what journalist Barbara Ehrenreich conducted for her book Nickel and
Dimed. One day over lunch with her editor, as the story goes, Ehrenreich mentioned an idea. How can
people exist on minimum-wage work? How do low-income workers get by? she wondered. Someone
should do a study. To her surprise, her editor responded, Why don’t you do it?
That’s how Ehrenreich found herself joining the ranks of the working class. For several months,
she left her comfortable home and lived and worked among people who lacked, for the most part,
higher education and marketable job skills. Undercover, she applied for and worked minimum wage
jobs as a waitress, a cleaning woman, a nursing home aide, and a retail chain employee. During her
participant observation, she used only her income from those jobs to pay for food, clothing,
transportation, and shelter.
She discovered the obvious, that it’s almost impossible to get by on minimum wage work. She also
experienced and observed attitudes many middle and upper class people never think about. She
witnessed firsthand the treatment of working class employees. She saw the extreme measures people
take to make ends meet and to survive. She described fellow employees who held two or three jobs,
worked seven days a week, lived in cars, could not pay to treat chronic health conditions, got randomly
fired, submitted to drug tests, and moved in and out of homeless shelters. She brought aspects of that
life to light, describing difficult working conditions and the poor treatment that low-wage workers
suffer.
Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America, the book she wrote upon her return to her real
life as a well-paid writer, has been widely read and used in many college classrooms.

sociologist discover after blending in? (Photo courtesy of drewzhrodague/flickr)
Ethnography
Ethnography is the extended observation of the social perspective and cultural values of an entire
social setting. Ethnographies involve objective observation of an entire community.
The heart of an ethnographic study focuses on how subjects view their own social standing and
how they understand themselves in relation to a community. An ethnographic study might observe, for
example, a small American fishing town, an Inuit community, a village in Thailand, a Buddhist
monastery, a private boarding school, or Disney World. These places all have borders. People live,
work, study, or vacation within those borders. People are there for a certain reason and therefore behave
in certain ways and respect certain cultural norms. An ethnographer would commit to spending a
determined amount of time studying every aspect of the chosen place, taking in as much as possible.
A sociologist studying a tribe in the Amazon might watch the way villagers go about their daily
lives and then write a paper about it. To observe a spiritual retreat center, an ethnographer might sign up
for a retreat and attend as a guest for an extended stay, observe and record data, and collate the material
into results.

The Making of Middletown: A Study in Modern
American Culture
In 1924, a young married couple named Robert and Helen Lynd undertook an unprecedented
ethnography: to apply sociological methods to the study of one US city in order to discover what
“ordinary” Americans did and believed. Choosing Muncie, Indiana (population about 30,000), as
their subject, they moved to the small town and lived there for eighteen months.
Ethnographers had been examining other cultures for decades—groups considered minority
or outsider—like gangs, immigrants, and the poor. But no one had studied the so-called average
American.
Recording interviews and using surveys to gather data, the Lynds did not sugarcoat or
idealize American life (PBS). They objectively stated what they observed. Researching existing
sources, they compared Muncie in 1890 to the Muncie they observed in 1924. Most Muncie adults,
they found, had grown up on farms but now lived in homes inside the city. From that discovery,
the Lynds focused their study on the impact of industrialization and urbanization.
They observed that Muncie was divided into business class and working class groups. They
defined business class as dealing with abstract concepts and symbols, while working class people
used tools to create concrete objects. The two classes led different lives with different goals and
hopes. However, the Lynds observed, mass production offered both classes the same amenities.
Like wealthy families, the working class was now able to own radios, cars, washing machines,
telephones, vacuum cleaners, and refrigerators. This was an emerging material new reality of the
1920s.
As the Lynds worked, they divided their manuscript into six sections: Getting a Living,
Making a Home, Training the Young, Using Leisure, Engaging in Religious Practices, and
Engaging in Community Activities. Each chapter included subsections such as “The Long Arm of
the Job” and “Why Do They Work So Hard?” in the “Getting a Living” chapter.
When the study was completed, the Lynds encountered a big problem. The Rockefeller
Foundation, which had commissioned the book, claimed it was useless and refused to publish it.
The Lynds asked if they could seek a publisher themselves.
Middletown: A Study in Modern American Culture was not only published in 1929, but
became an instant bestseller, a status unheard of for a sociological study. The book sold out six
printings in its first year of publication, and has never gone out of print (PBS).
Nothing like it had ever been done before. Middletown was reviewed on the front page of the
New York Times. Readers in the 1920s and 1930s identified with the citizens of Muncie, Indiana,
but they were equally fascinated by the sociological methods and the use of scientific data to
define ordinary Americans. The book was proof that social data was important—and
interesting—to the American public.

CHAPTER 2 | SOCIOLOGICAL RESEARCH

Case Study
Sometimes a researcher wants to study one specific person or event. A case study is an in-depth
analysis of a single event, situation, or individual. To conduct a case study, a researcher examines
existing sources like documents and archival records, conducts interviews, engages in direct
observation, and even participant observation, if possible.
Researchers might use this method to study a single case of, for example, a foster child, drug lord,
cancer patient, criminal, or rape victim. However, a major criticism of the case study as a method is that
a developed study of a single case, while offering depth on a topic, does not provide enough evidence to
form a generalized conclusion. In other words, it is difficult to make universal claims based on just one
person, since one person does not verify a pattern. This is why most sociologists do not use case studies
as a primary research method.
However, case studies are useful when the single case is unique. In these instances, a single case
study can add tremendous knowledge to a certain discipline. For example, a feral child, also called
“wild child,” is one who grows up isolated from human beings. Feral children grow up without social
contact and language, elements crucial to a “civilized” child’s development. These children mimic the
behaviors and movements of animals, and often invent their own language. There are only about one
hundred cases of “feral children” in the world.
As you may imagine, a feral child is a subject of great interest to researchers. Feral children
provide unique information about child development because they have grown up outside of the
parameters of “normal” child development. And since there are very few feral children, the case study
is the most appropriate method for researchers to use in studying the subject.
At age 3, a Ukranian girl named Oxana Malaya suffered severe parental neglect. She lived in a
shed with dogs, eating raw meat and scraps. Five years later, a neighbor called authorities and reported
seeing a girl who ran on all fours, barking. Officials brought Oxana into society, where she was cared
for and taught some human behaviors, but she never became fully socialized. She has been designated
as unable to support herself and now lives in a mental institution (Grice 2011). Case studies like this
offer a way for sociologists to collect data that may not be collectable by any other method.

Experiments
You’ve probably tested personal social theories. “If I study at night and review in the morning, I’ll
improve my retention skills.” Or, “If I stop drinking soda, I’ll feel better.” Cause and effect. If this, then
that. When you test the theory, your results either prove or disprove your hypothesis.
One way researchers test social theories is by conducting an experiment, meaning they investigate
relationships to test a hypothesis—a scientific approach.
There are two main types of experiments: lab-based experiments and natural or field experiments.
In a lab setting, the research can be controlled so that perhaps more data can be recorded in a certain
amount of time. In a natural or field-based experiment, the generation of data cannot be controlled but
the information might be considered more accurate since it was collected without interference or
intervention by the researcher.
As a research method, either type of sociological experiment is useful for testing if-then
statements: if a particular thing happens, then another particular thing will result. To set up a lab-based
experiment, sociologists create artificial situations that allow them to manipulate variables.
Classically, the sociologist selects a set of people with similar characteristics, such as age, class,
race, or education. Those people are divided into two groups. One is the experimental group and the
other is the control group. The experimental group is exposed to the independent variable(s) and the
control group is not. To test the benefits of tutoring, for example, the sociologist might expose the
experimental group of students to tutoring but not the control group. Then both groups would be tested
for differences in performance to see if tutoring had an effect on the experimental group of students. As
you can imagine, in a case like this, the researcher would not want to jeopardize the accomplishments
of either group of students, so the setting would be somewhat artificial. The test would not be for a
grade reflected on their permanent record, for example.

An Experiment in Action

Figure 2.10 Sociologist Frances Heussenstamm conducted an experiment to explore the correlation between traffic
stops and race-based bumper stickers. This issue of racial profiling remains a hot-button topic today. (Photo courtesy of
dwightsghost/flickr)

A real-life example will help illustrate the experiment process. In 1971, Frances Heussenstamm, a
sociology professor at California State University at Los Angeles, had a theory about police
prejudice. To test her theory she conducted an experiment. She chose fifteen students from three
ethnic backgrounds: black, white, and Hispanic. She chose students who routinely drove to and
from campus along Los Angeles freeway routes, and who’d had perfect driving records for longer
than a year. Those were her independent variables—students, good driving records, same commute
route.
Next, she placed a Black Panther bumper sticker on each car. That sticker, a representation of
a social value, was the independent variable. In the 1970s, the Black Panthers were a revolutionary
group actively fighting racism. Heussenstamm asked the students to follow their normal driving
patterns. She wanted to see if seeming support of the Black Panthers would change how these
good drivers were treated by the police patrolling the highways.
The first arrest, for an incorrect lane change, was made two hours after the experiment began.
One participant was pulled over three times in three days. He quit the study. After seventeen days,
the fifteen drivers had collected a total of thirty-three traffic citations. The experiment was halted.
The funding to pay traffic fines had run out, and so had the enthusiasm of the participants
(Heussenstamm 1971).

Secondary Data Analysis
While sociologists often engage in original research studies, they also contribute knowledge to the
discipline through secondary data analysis. Secondary data don’t result from firsthand research
collected from primary sources, but are the already completed work of other researchers. Sociologists
might study works written by historians, economists, teachers, or early sociologists. They might search
through periodicals, newspapers, or magazines from any period in history.
Using available information not only saves time and money, but it can add depth to a study.
Sociologists often interpret findings in a new way, a way that was not part of an author’s original
purpose or intention. To study how women were encouraged to act and behave in the 1960s, for
example, a researcher might watch movies, televisions shows, and situation comedies from that period.
Or to research changes in behavior and attitudes due to the emergence of television in the late 1950s
and early 1960s, a sociologist would rely on new interpretations of secondary data. Decades from now,
researchers will most likely conduct similar studies on the advent of mobile phones, the Internet, or
Facebook.
Social scientists also learn by analyzing the research of a variety of agencies. Governmental
departments and global groups, like the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics or the World Health

45

46

CHAPTER 2 | SOCIOLOGICAL RESEARCH

Organization, publish studies with findings that are useful to sociologists. A public statistic like the
foreclosure rate might be useful for studying the effects of the 2008 recession; a racial demographic
profile might be compared with data on education funding to examine the resources accessible by
different groups.
One of the advantages of secondary data is that it is nonreactive (or unobtrusive) research,
meaning that it does not include direct contact with subjects and will not alter or influence people’s
behaviors. Unlike studies requiring direct contact with people, using previously published data doesn’t
require entering a population and the investment and risks inherent in that research process.
Using available data does have its challenges. Public records are not always easy to access. A
researcher will need to do some legwork to track them down and gain access to records. To guide the
search through a vast library of materials and avoid wasting time reading unrelated sources, sociologists
employ content analysis, applying a systematic approach to record and value information gleaned from
secondary data as they relate to the study at hand.
But, in some cases, there is no way to verify the accuracy of existing data. It is easy to count how
many drunk drivers, for example, are pulled over by the police. But how many are not? While it’s
possible to discover the percentage of teenage students who drop out of high school, it might be more
challenging to determine the number who return to school or get their GED later.
Another problem arises when data are unavailable in the exact form needed or do not include the
precise angle the researcher seeks. For example, the average salaries paid to professors at a public
school is public record. But the separate figures don’t necessarily reveal how long it took each professor
to reach the salary range, what their educational backgrounds are, or how long they’ve been teaching.
To write some of his books, sociologist Richard Sennett used secondary data to shed light on
current trends. In The Craftsman (2008), he studied the human desire to perform quality work, from
carpentry to computer programming. He studied the line between craftsmanship and skilled manual
labor. He also studied changes in attitudes toward craftsmanship that occurred not only during and after
the Industrial Revolution, but also in ancient times. Obviously, he could not have firsthand knowledge
of periods of ancient history; he had to rely on secondary data for part of his study.
When conducting content analysis, it is important to consider the date of publication of an existing
source and to take into account attitudes and common cultural ideals that may have influenced the
research. For example, Robert S. Lynd and Helen Merrell Lynd gathered research for their book
Middletown: A Study in Modern American Culture in the 1920s. Attitudes and cultural norms were
vastly different then than they are now. Beliefs about gender roles, race, education, and work have
changed significantly since then. At the time, the study’s purpose was to reveal the truth about small
American communities. Today, it is an illustration of 1920s attitudes and values.

2.3 Ethical Concerns
Sociologists conduct studies to shed light on human behaviors. Knowledge is a powerful tool that can
be used toward positive change. And while a sociologist’s goal is often simply to uncover knowledge
rather than to spur action, many people use sociological studies to help improve people’s lives. In that
sense, conducting a sociological study comes with a tremendous amount of responsibility. Like any
researchers, sociologists must consider their ethical obligation to avoid harming subjects or groups
while conducting their research.
The American Sociological Association, or ASA, is the major professional organization of
sociologists in North America. The ASA is a great resource for students of sociology as well. The ASA
maintains a code of ethics—formal guidelines for conducting sociological research—consisting of
principles and ethical standards to be used in the discipline. It also describes procedures for filing,
investigating, and resolving complaints of unethical conduct.
Practicing sociologists and sociology students have a lot to consider. Some of the guidelines state
that researchers must try to be skillful and fair-minded in their work, especially as it relates to their
human subjects. Researchers must obtain participants’ informed consent, and inform subjects of the
responsibilities and risks of research before they agree to partake. During a study, sociologists must
ensure the safety of participants and immediately stop work if a subject becomes potentially endangered
on any level.
Researchers are required to protect the privacy of research participants whenever possible. Even if
pressured by authorities, such as police or courts, researchers are not ethically allowed to release
confidential information. Researchers must make results available to other sociologists, must make
public all sources of financial support, and must not accept funding from any organization that might

CHAPTER 2 | SOCIOLOGICAL RESEARCH

cause a conflict of interest or seek to influence the research results for its own purposes. The ASA’s
ethical considerations shape not only the study but also the publication of results.
Pioneer German sociologist Max Weber (1864–1920) identified another crucial ethical concern.
Weber understood that personal values could distort the framework for disclosing study results. While
he accepted that some aspects of research design might be influenced by personal values, he declared it
was entirely inappropriate to allow personal values to shape the interpretation of the responses.
Sociologists, he stated, must establish value neutrality, a practice of remaining impartial, without bias
or judgment, during the course of a study and in publishing results (1949). Sociologists are obligated to
disclose research findings without omitting or distorting significant data.
Is value neutrality possible? Many sociologists believe it is impossible to set aside personal values
and retain complete objectivity. They caution readers, rather, to understand that sociological studies
may, by necessity, contain a certain amount of value bias. It does not discredit the results but allows
readers to view them as one form of truth rather than a singular fact. Some sociologists attempt to
remain uncritical and as objective as possible when studying cultural institutions. Value neutrality does
not mean having no opinions. It means striving to overcome personal biases, particularly subconscious
biases, when analyzing data. It means avoiding skewing data in order to match a predetermined
outcome that aligns with a particular agenda, such as a political or moral point of view. Investigators are
ethically obligated to report results, even when they contradict personal views, predicted outcomes, or
widely accepted beliefs.

Section Summary
2.1 Approaches to Sociological Research
Using the scientific method, a researcher conducts a study in five phases: asking a question, researching
existing sources, formulating a hypothesis, conducting a study, and drawing conclusions. The scientific
method is useful in that it provides a clear method of organizing a study. Some sociologists conduct
research through an interpretive framework rather than employing the scientific method.
Scientific sociological studies often observe relationships between variables. Researchers study how
one variable changes another. Prior to conducting a study, researchers are careful to apply operational
definitions to their terms and to establish dependent and independent variables.

2.2 Research Methods
Sociological research is a fairly complex process. As you can see, a lot goes into even a simple research
design. There are many steps and much to consider when collecting data on human behavior, as well as
in interpreting and analyzing data in order to form conclusive results. Sociologists use scientific
methods for good reason. The scientific method provides a system of organization that helps
researchers plan and conduct the study while ensuring that data and results are reliable, valid, and
objective.

CHAPTER 2 | SOCIOLOGICAL RESEARCH

The many methods available to researchers—including experiments, surveys, field studies, and
secondary data analysis—all come with advantages and disadvantages. The strength of a study can
depend on the choice and implementation of the appropriate method of gathering research. Depending
on the topic, a study might use a single method or a combination of methods. It is important to plan a
research design before undertaking a study. The information gathered may in itself be surprising, and
the study design should provide a solid framework in which to analyze predicted and unpredicted data.

2.3 Ethical Concerns
Sociologists and sociology students must take ethical responsibility for any study they conduct. They
must first and foremost guarantee the safety of their participants. Whenever possible, they must ensure
that participants have been fully informed before consenting to be part of a study.
The ASA (American Sociological Association) maintains ethical guidelines that sociologists must take
into account as they conduct research. The guidelines address conducting studies, properly using
existing sources, accepting funding, and publishing results.
Sociologists must try to maintain value neutrality. They must gather and analyze data objectively,

Short Answer
2.1 Approaches to Sociological Research
1. Write down the first three steps of the scientific method. Think of a broad topic that you are
interested in and which would make a good sociological study—for example, ethnic diversity in a
college, homecoming rituals, athletic scholarships, or teen driving. Now, take that topic through the first
steps of the process. For each step, write a few sentences or a paragraph: 1) Ask a question about the
topic. 2) Do some research and write down the titles of some articles or books you’d want to read about
the topic. 3) Formulate a hypothesis.

2.2 Research Methods
2. What type of data do surveys gather? For what topics would surveys be the best research method?
What drawbacks might you expect to encounter when using a survey? To explore further, ask a research
question and write a hypothesis. Then create a survey of about six questions relevant to the topic.
Provide a rationale for each question. Now define your population and create a plan for recruiting a
random sample and administering the survey.
3. Imagine you are about to do field research in a specific place for a set time. Instead of thinking about
the topic of study itself, consider how you, as the researcher, will have to prepare for the study. What
personal, social, and physical sacrifices will you have to make? How will you manage your personal
effects? What organizational equipment and systems will you need to collect the data?
4. Create a brief research design about a topic in which you are passionately interested. Now write a
letter to a philanthropic or grant organization requesting funding for your study. How can you describe
the project in a convincing yet realistic and objective way? Explain how the results of your study will
be a relevant contribution to the body of sociological work already in existence.

2.3 Ethical Concerns
5. Why do you think the ASA crafted such a detailed set of ethical principles? What type of study could
put human participants at risk? Think of some examples of studies that might be harmful. Do you think
that, in the name of sociology, some researchers might be tempted to cross boundaries that threaten
human rights? Why?
6. Would you willingly participate in a sociological study that could potentially put your health and
safety at risk, but had the potential to help thousands or even hundreds of thousands of people? For
example, would you participate in a study of a new drug that could cure diabetes or cancer, even if it
meant great inconvenience and physical discomfort for you or possible permanent damage?

Introduction to Culture
Are there rules for eating at McDonald’s? Generally, we do not think about rules in a fast food
restaurant, but if you look around one on a typical weekday, you will see people acting as if they were
trained for the role of fast food customer. They stand in line, pick items from the colorful menus, swipe
debit cards to pay, and wait to collect trays of food. After a quick meal, customers wad up their paper
wrappers and toss them into garbage cans. Customers’ movement through this fast food routine is
orderly and predictable, even if no rules are posted and no officials direct the process.

55

56

CHAPTER 3 | CULTURE

If you want more insight into these unwritten rules, think about what would happen if you behaved
according to some other standards. (You would be doing what sociologists call ethnomethodology:
deliberately disrupting social norms in order to learn about them.) For example, call ahead for
reservations, ask the cashier detailed questions about the food’s ingredients or how it is prepared. Ask
to have your meal served to you at your table. Or throw your trash on the ground as you leave. Chances
are, you will elicit hostile responses from the restaurant employees and your fellow customers.
People have written entire books analyzing the significance of fast food customs. They examine
the extensive, detailed physicality of fast food: the food itself, wrappers, bags, trays, those tiny ketchup
packets, the tables and chairs, and even the restaurant building. Everything about a chain restaurant
reflects culture, the beliefs and behaviors that a social group shares. Sociological analysis can be
applied to every expression of culture, from sporting events to holidays, from education to
transportation, from fashion to etiquette.
In everyday conversation, people rarely distinguish between the terms culture and society, but the
terms have slightly different meanings, and the distinction is important to a sociologist. A society
describes a group of people who share a community and a culture. By “community,” sociologists refer
to a definable region—as small as a neighborhood (Brooklyn, or “the east side of town”), as large as a
country (Ethiopia, the United States, or Nepal), or somewhere in between (in America, this might
include someone who identifies with Southern or Midwestern society). To clarify, a culture represents
the beliefs and practices of a group, while society represents the people who share those beliefs and
practices. Neither society nor culture could exist without the other. In this chapter, we examine the
relationship between culture and society in greater detail, paying special attention to the elements and
forces that shape culture, including diversity and cultural changes. A final discussion touches on the
different theoretical perspectives from which sociologists research culture.

3.1 What Is Culture?
Humans are social creatures. Since the dawn of Homo sapiens nearly 250,000 years ago, people have
grouped together into communities in order to survive. Living together, people form common habits
and behaviors—from specific methods of childrearing to preferred techniques for obtaining food. In
modern-day Paris, many people shop daily at outdoor markets to pick up what they need for their
evening meal, buying cheese, meat, and vegetables from different specialty stalls. In the United States,
the majority of people shop once a week at supermarkets, filling large carts to the brim. How would a
Parisian perceive U.S. shopping behaviors that Americans take for granted?
Almost every human behavior, from shopping to marriage to expressions of feelings, is learned. In
the United States, people tend to view marriage as a choice between two people, based on mutual
feelings of love. In other nations and in other times, marriages have been arranged through an intricate
process of interviews and negotiations between entire families, or in other cases, through a direct
system such as a “mail order bride.” To someone raised in New York City, the marriage customs of a
family from Nigeria may seem strange, or even wrong. Conversely, someone from a traditional Kolkata
family might be perplexed with the idea of romantic love as the foundation for marriage lifelong
commitment. In other words, the way in which people view marriage depends largely on what they
have been taught.
Behavior based on learned customs is not a bad thing. Being familiar with unwritten rules helps
people feel secure and “normal.” Most people want to live their daily lives confident that their
behaviors will not be challenged or disrupted. But even an action as seemingly simple as commuting to
work evidences a great deal of cultural propriety.

CHAPTER 3 | CULTURE

Figure 3.2 How would a visitor from suburban America act and feel on this crowded Tokyo train? (Photo courtesy of
simonglucas/flickr)
Take the case of going to work on public transportation. Whether commuting in Dublin, Cairo,
Mumbai, or San Francisco, many behaviors will be the same in all locations, but significant differences
also arise between cultures. Typically, a passenger would find a marked bus stop or station, wait for his
bus or train, pay an agent before or after boarding, and quietly take a seat if one is available. But when
boarding a bus in Cairo, passengers might have to run, because buses there often do not come to a full
stop to take on patrons. Dublin bus riders would be expected to extend an arm to indicate that they want
the bus to stop for them. And when boarding a commuter train in Mumbai, passengers must squeeze
into overstuffed cars amid a lot of pushing and shoving on the crowded platforms. That kind of
behavior would be considered the height of rudeness in United States, but in Mumbai it reflects the
daily challenges of getting around on a train system that is taxed to capacity.
In this example of commuting, culture consists of thoughts (expectations about personal space, for
example) and tangible things (bus stops, trains, and seating capacity). Material culture refers to the
objects or belongings of a group of people. Metro passes and bus tokens are part of material culture, as
are automobiles, stores, and the physical structures where people worship. Nonmaterial culture, in
contrast, consists of the ideas, attitudes, and beliefs of a society. Material and nonmaterial aspects of
culture are linked, and physical objects often symbolize cultural ideas. A metro pass is a material
object, but it represents a form of nonmaterial culture, namely, capitalism, and the acceptance of paying
for transportation. Clothing, hairstyles, and jewelry are part of material culture, but the appropriateness
of wearing certain clothing for specific events reflects nonmaterial culture. A school building belongs to
material culture, but the teaching methods and educational standards are part of education’s nonmaterial
culture. These material and nonmaterial aspects of culture can vary subtly from region to region. As
people travel farther afield, moving from different regions to entirely different parts of the world,
certain material and nonmaterial aspects of culture become dramatically unfamiliar. What happens
when we encounter different cultures? As we interact with cultures other than our own, we become
more aware of the differences and commonalities between others’ worlds and our own.

Cultural Universals
Often, a comparison of one culture to another will reveal obvious differences. But all cultures also share
common elements. Cultural universals are patterns or traits that are globally common to all societies.
One example of a cultural universal is the family unit: every human society recognizes a family
structure that regulates sexual reproduction and the care of children. Even so, how that family unit is
defined and how it functions vary. In many Asian cultures, for example, family members from all
generations commonly live together in one household. In these cultures, young adults will continue to
live in the extended household family structure until they marry and join their spouse’s household, or
they may remain and raise their nuclear family within the extended family’s homestead. In the United
States, by contrast, individuals are expected to leave home and live independently for a period before
forming a family unit consisting of parents and their offspring.
Anthropologist George Murdock first recognized the existence of cultural universals while
studying systems of kinship around the world. Murdock found that cultural universals often revolve
around basic human survival, such as finding food, clothing, and shelter, or around shared human
experiences, such as birth and death, or illness and healing. Through his research, Murdock identified
other universals including language, the concept of personal names, and, interestingly, jokes. Humor
seems to be a universal way to release tensions and create a sense of unity among people (Murdock

CHAPTER 3 | CULTURE

1949). Sociologists consider humor necessary to human interaction because it helps individuals
navigate otherwise tense situations.

Is Music a Cultural Universal?
Imagine that you are sitting in a theater, watching a film. The movie opens with the heroine sitting
on a park bench, a grim expression on her face. Cue the music. The first slow and mournful notes
are played in a minor key. As the melody continues, the heroine turns her head and sees a man
walking toward her. The music slowly gets louder, and the dissonance of the chords sends a prickle
of fear running down your spine. You sense that the heroine is in danger.
Now imagine that you are watching the same movie, but with a different soundtrack. As the
scene opens, the music is soft and soothing, with a hint of sadness. You see the heroine sitting on
the park bench and sense her loneliness. Suddenly, the music swells. The woman looks up and sees
a man walking toward her. The music grows fuller, and the pace picks up. You feel your heart rise
in your chest. This is a happy moment.
Music has the ability to evoke emotional responses. In television shows, movies, even
commercials, music elicits laughter, sadness, or fear. Are these types of musical cues cultural
universals?
In 2009, a team of psychologists, led by Thomas Fritz of the Max Planck Institute for Human
Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig, Germany, studied people’s reactions to music they’d
never heard (Fritz et al. 2009). The research team traveled to Cameroon, Africa, and asked Mafa
tribal members to listen to Western music. The tribe, isolated from Western culture, had never been
exposed to Western culture and had no context or experience within which to interpret its music.
Even so, as the tribal members listened to a Western piano piece, they were able to recognize three
basic emotions: happiness, sadness, and fear. Music, it turns out, is a sort of universal language.
Researchers also found that music can foster a sense of wholeness within a group. In fact,
scientists who study the evolution of language have concluded that originally language (an
established component of group identity) and music were one (Darwin 1871). Additionally, since
music is largely nonverbal, the sounds of music can cross societal boundaries more easily than
words. Music allows people to make connections where language might be a more difficult
barricade. As Fritz and his team found, music and the emotions it conveys can be cultural
universals.

Ethnocentrism and Cultural Relativism
Despite how much humans have in common, cultural differences are far more prevalent than cultural
universals. For example, while all cultures have language, analysis of particular language structures and
conversational etiquette reveal tremendous differences. In some Middle Eastern cultures, it is common
to stand close to others in conversation. North Americans keep more distance, maintaining a large
“personal space.” Even something as simple as eating and drinking varies greatly from culture to
culture. If your professor comes into an early morning class holding a mug of liquid, what do you
assume she is drinking? In the United States, it’s most likely filled with coffee, not Earl Grey tea, a
favorite in England, or Yak Butter tea, a staple in Tibet.
The way cuisines vary across cultures fascinates many people. Some travelers pride themselves on
their willingness to try unfamiliar foods, like celebrated food writer Anthony Bourdain, while others
return home expressing gratitude for their native culture’s fare. Often, Americans express disgust at
other cultures’ cuisine, thinking it’s gross to eat meat from a dog or guinea pig, for example, while they
don’t question their own habit of eating cows or pigs. Such attitudes are an example of ethnocentrism,
or evaluating and judging another culture based on how it compares to one’s own cultural norms.
Ethnocentrism, as sociologist William Graham Sumner (1906) described the term, involves a belief or
attitude that one’s own culture is better than all others. Almost everyone is a little bit ethnocentric. For
example, Americans tend to say that people from England drive on the “wrong” side of the road, rather
than the “other” side. Someone from a country where dog meat is standard fare might find it off-putting
to see a dog in a French restaurant—not on the menu, but as a pet and patron’s companion.

CHAPTER 3 | CULTURE

A high level of appreciation for one’s own culture can be healthy; a shared sense of community
pride, for example, connects people in a society. But ethnocentrism can lead to disdain or dislike for
other cultures, causing misunderstanding and conflict. People with the best intentions sometimes travel
to a society to “help” its people, seeing them as uneducated or backward; essentially inferior. In reality,
these travelers are guilty of cultural imperialism, the deliberate imposition of one’s own cultural
values on another culture. Europe’s colonial expansion, begun in the 16th century, was often
accompanied by a severe cultural imperialism. European colonizers often viewed the people in the
lands they colonized as uncultured savages who were in need of European governance, dress, religion,
and other cultural practices. A more modern example of cultural imperialism may include the work of
international aid agencies who introduce agricultural methods and plant species from developed
countries while overlooking indigenous varieties and agricultural approaches that are better suited to the
particular region.
Ethnocentrism can be so strong that when confronted with all the differences of a new culture, one
may experience disorientation and frustration. In sociology, we call this culture shock. A traveler from
Chicago might find the nightly silence of rural Montana unsettling, not peaceful. An exchange student
from China might be annoyed by the constant interruptions in class as other students ask questions—a
practice that is considered rude in China. Perhaps the Chicago traveler was initially captivated with
Montana’s quiet beauty and the Chinese student was originally excited to see an American-style
classroom firsthand. But as they experience unanticipated differences from their own culture, their
excitement gives way to discomfort and doubts about how to behave appropriately in the new situation.
Eventually, as people learn more about a culture, they recover from culture shock.
Culture shock may appear because people aren’t always expecting cultural differences.
Anthropologist Ken Barger (1971) discovered this when conducting participatory observation in an
Inuit community in the Canadian Arctic. Originally from Indiana, Barger hesitated when invited to join
a local snowshoe race. He knew he’d never hold his own against these experts. Sure enough, he
finished last, to his mortification. But the tribal members congratulated him, saying, “You really tried!”
In Barger’s own culture, he had learned to value victory. To the Inuit people, winning was enjoyable,
but their culture valued survival skills essential to their environment: how hard someone tried could
mean the difference between life and death. Over the course of his stay, Barger participated in caribou
hunts, learned how to take shelter in winter storms, and sometimes went days with little or no food to
share among tribal members. Trying hard and working together, two nonmaterial values, were indeed
much more important than winning.
During his time with the Inuit tribe, Barger learned to engage in cultural relativism. Cultural
relativism is the practice of assessing a culture by its own standards rather than viewing it through the
lens of one’s own culture. Practicing cultural relativism requires an open mind and a willingness to
consider, and even adapt to, new values and norms. However, indiscriminately embracing everything
about a new culture is not always possible. Even the most culturally relativist people from egalitarian
societies—ones in which women have political rights and control over their own bodies—would
question whether the widespread practice of female genital mutilation in countries such as Ethiopia and
Sudan should be accepted as a part of cultural tradition. Sociologists attempting to engage in cultural
relativism, then, may struggle to reconcile aspects of their own culture with aspects of a culture they are
studying.
Sometimes when people attempt to rectify feelings of ethnocentrism and develop cultural
relativism, they swing too far to the other end of the spectrum. Xenocentrism is the opposite of
ethnocentrism, and refers to the belief that another culture is superior to one’s own. (The Greek root
word xeno, pronounced “ZEE-no,” means “stranger” or “foreign guest.”) An exchange student who
goes home after a semester abroad or a sociologist who returns from the field may find it difficult to
associate with the values of their own culture after having experienced what they deem a more upright
or nobler way of living.
Perhaps the greatest challenge for sociologists studying different cultures is the matter of keeping a
perspective. It is impossible for anyone to keep all cultural biases at bay; the best we can do is strive to
be aware of them. Pride in one’s own culture doesn’t have to lead to imposing its values on others. And
an appreciation for another culture shouldn’t preclude individuals from studying it with a critical eye.

Overcoming Culture Shock
During her summer vacation, Caitlin flew from Chicago to Madrid to visit Maria, the exchange
student she’d befriended the previous semester. In the airport, she heard rapid, musical Spanish
being spoken all around her. Exciting as it was, she felt isolated and disconnected. Maria’s mother
kissed Caitlin on both cheeks when she greeted her. Her imposing father kept his distance. Caitlin
was half asleep by the time supper was served—at 10 pm! Maria’s family sat at the table for hours,
speaking loudly, gesturing, and arguing about politics, a taboo dinner subject in Caitlin’s house.
They served wine and toasted their honored guest. Caitlin had trouble interpreting her hosts’ facial
expressions, and didn’t realize she should make the next toast. That night, Caitlin crawled into a
strange bed, wishing she hadn’t come. She missed her home and felt overwhelmed by the new
customs, language, and surroundings. She’d studied Spanish in school for years—why hadn’t it
prepared her for this?
What Caitlin hadn’t realized was that people depend not only on spoken words, but on subtle
cues like gestures and facial expressions, to communicate. Cultural norms accompany even the
smallest nonverbal signals (DuBois 1951). They help people know when to shake hands, where to
sit, how to converse, and even when to laugh. We relate to others through a shared set of cultural
norms, and ordinarily, we take them for granted.
For this reason, culture shock is often associated with traveling abroad, although it can
happen in one’s own country, state, or even hometown. Anthropologist Kalervo Oberg (1960) is
credited with first coining the term “culture shock.” In his studies, Oberg found that most people
found encountering a new culture to be exciting at first. But bit by bit, they became stressed by
interacting with people from a different culture who spoke another language and used different
regional expressions. There was new food to digest, new daily schedules to follow, and new rules
of etiquette to learn. Living with this constant stress can make people feel incompetent and
insecure. People react to frustration in a new culture, Oberg found, by initially rejecting it and
glorifying one’s own culture. An American visiting Italy might long for a “real” pizza or complain
about the unsafe driving habits of Italians compared to people in the United States.
It helps to remember that culture is learned. Everyone is ethnocentric to an extent, and
identifying with one’s own country is natural.
Caitlin’s shock was minor compared to that of her friends Dayar and Mahlika, a Turkish
couple living in married student housing on campus. And it was nothing like that of her classmate
Sanai. Sanai had been forced to flee war torn Bosnia with her family when she was fifteen. After
two weeks in Spain, Caitlin had developed a bit more compassion and understanding for what
those people had gone through. She understood that adjusting to a new culture takes time. It can
take weeks or months to recover from culture shock, and years to fully adjust to living in a new
culture.
By the end of Caitlin’s trip, she’d made new lifelong friends. She’d stepped out of her
comfort zone. She’d learned a lot about Spain, but she’d also discovered a lot about herself and her
own culture.

3.2 Elements of Culture
Values and Beliefs
The first, and perhaps most crucial, elements of culture we will discuss are its values and beliefs.
Values are a culture’s standard for discerning what is good and just in society. Values are deeply
embedded and critical for transmitting and teaching a culture’s beliefs. Beliefs are the tenets or
convictions that people hold to be true. Individuals in a society have specific beliefs, but they also share
collective values. To illustrate the difference, Americans commonly believe in the American
Dream—that anyone who works hard enough will be successful and wealthy. Underlying this belief is
the American value that wealth is good and important.
Values help shape a society by suggesting what is good and bad, beautiful and ugly, sought or
avoided. Consider the value the culture the United States places upon youth. Children represent
innocence and purity, while a youthful adult appearance signifies sexuality. Shaped by this value,
individuals spend millions of dollars each year on cosmetic products and surgeries to look young and
beautiful. The United States also has an individualistic culture, meaning people place a high value on
individuality and independence. In contrast, many other cultures are collectivist, meaning the welfare of
the group and group relationships are a primary value.
Living up to a culture’s values can be difficult. It’s easy to value good health, but it’s hard to quit
smoking. Marital monogamy is valued, but many spouses engage in infidelity. Cultural diversity and
equal opportunities for all people are valued in the United States, yet the country’s highest political
offices have been dominated by white men.
Values often suggest how people should behave, but they don’t accurately reflect how people do
behave. Values portray an ideal culture, the standards society would like to embrace and live up to. But
ideal culture differs from real culture, the way society actually is, based on what occurs and exists. In
an ideal culture, there would be no traffic accidents, murders, poverty, or racial tension. But in real
culture, police officers, lawmakers, educators, and social workers constantly strive to prevent or repair
those accidents, crimes, and injustices. American teenagers are encouraged to value celibacy. However,
the number of unplanned pregnancies among teens reveals that not only is the ideal hard to live up to,
but that the value alone is not enough to spare teenagers from the potential consequences of having sex.
One way societies strive to put values into action is through rewards, sanctions, and punishments.
When people observe the norms of society and uphold its values, they are often rewarded. A boy who
helps an elderly woman board a bus may receive a smile and a “thank you.” A business manager who
raises profit margins may receive a quarterly bonus. People sanction certain behaviors by giving their
support, approval, or permission, or by instilling formal actions of disapproval and non-support.
Sanctions are a form of social control, a way to encourage conformity to cultural norms. Sometimes
people conform to norms in anticipation or expectation of positive sanctions: good grades, for instance,
may mean praise from parents and teachers.

CHAPTER 3 | CULTURE

When people go against a society’s values, they are punished. A boy who shoves an elderly
woman aside to board the bus first may receive frowns or even a scolding from other passengers. A
business manager who drives away customers will likely be fired. Breaking norms and rejecting values
can lead to cultural sanctions such as earning a negative label—lazy, no-good bum—or to legal
sanctions such as traffic tickets, fines, or imprisonment.
Values are not static; they vary across time and between groups as people evaluate, debate, and
change collective societal beliefs. Values also vary from culture to culture. For example, cultures differ
in their values about what kinds of physical closeness are appropriate in public. It’s rare to see two male
friends or coworkers holding hands in the United States where that behavior often symbolizes romantic
feelings. But in many nations, masculine physical intimacy is considered natural in public. This
difference in cultural values came to light when people reacted to photos of former president George W.
Bush holding hands with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia in 2005. A simple gesture, such as handholding, carries great symbolic differences across cultures.

would Americans react to these two soldiers? (Photo courtesy of Geordie Mott/Wikimedia Commons)

Norms
So far, the examples in this chapter have often described how people are expected to behave in certain
situations—for example, when buying food or boarding a bus. These examples describe the visible and
invisible rules of conduct through which societies are structured, or what sociologists call norms.
Norms define how to behave in accordance with what a society has defined as good, right, and
important, and most members of the society adhere to them.
Formal norms are established, written rules. They are behaviors worked out and agreed upon in
order to suit and serve the most people. Laws are formal norms, but so are employee manuals, college
entrance exam requirements, and “no running” signs at swimming pools. Formal norms are the most
specific and clearly stated of the various types of norms, and the most strictly enforced. But even formal
norms are enforced to varying degrees, reflected in cultural values.
For example, money is highly valued in the United States, so monetary crimes are punished. It’s
against the law to rob a bank, and banks go to great lengths to prevent such crimes. People safeguard
valuable possessions and install antitheft devices to protect homes and cars. A less strictly enforced
social norm is driving while intoxicated. While it’s against the law to drive drunk, drinking is for the
most part an acceptable social behavior. And though there are laws to punish drunk driving, there are
few systems in place to prevent the crime. These examples show a range of enforcement in formal
norms.
There are plenty of formal norms, but the list of informal norms—casual behaviors that are
generally and widely conformed to—is longer. People learn informal norms by observation, imitation,
and general socialization. Some informal norms are taught directly—“Kiss your Aunt Edna” or “Use
your napkin”—while others are learned by observation, including observations of the consequences
when someone else violates a norm. But although informal norms define personal interactions, they
extend into other systems as well. Think back to the discussion of fast food restaurants at the beginning
of this chapter. In the United States, there are informal norms regarding behavior at these restaurants.
Customers line up to order their food, and leave when they are done. They don’t sit down at a table with
strangers, sing loudly as they prepare their condiments, or nap in a booth. Most people don’t commit
even benign breaches of informal norms. Informal norms dictate appropriate behaviors without the need
of written rules.

Sociological Research

Breaching Experiments
Sociologist Harold Garfinkel (1917–2011) studied people’s customs in order to find out how
societal rules and norms not only influenced behavior but shaped social order. He believed that
members of society together create a social order (Weber 2011). His resulting book, Studies in
Ethnomethodology, published in 1967, discusses people’s assumptions about the social make-up of
their communities.
One of his research methods was known as a “breaching experiment.” His breaching
experiments tested sociological concepts of social norms and conformity. In a breaching
experiment, the researcher behaves in a socially awkward manner. The participants are not aware
an experiment is in progress. If the breach is successful, however, these “innocent bystanders” will
respond in some way. For example, if the experimenter is, say, a man in a business suit, and he
skips down the sidewalk or hops on one foot, the passersby are likely to stare at him with surprised
expressions on their faces. But the experimenter does not simply “act weird” in public. Rather, the
point is to deviate from a specific social norm in a small way, to subtly break some form of social
etiquette, and see what happens.
To conduct his ethnomethodology, Garfinkel deliberately imposed strange behaviors on
unknowing people. Then he would observe their responses. He suspected that odd behaviors
would shatter conventional expectations, but he wasn’t sure how. He set up, for example, a simple
game of tic-tac-toe. One player was asked beforehand not to mark Xs and Os in the boxes but on
the lines dividing the spaces instead. The other player, in the dark about the study, was
flabbergasted and did not know how to continue. Their reactions of outrage, anger, puzzlement, or
other emotions illustrated the existence of cultural norms that constitute social life. These cultural
norms play an important role. They let us know how to behave around each other and how to feel
comfortable in our community.
There are many rules about speaking with strangers in public. It’s okay to tell a woman you
like her shoes. It’s not okay to ask if you can try them on. It’s okay to stand in line behind someone
at the ATM. It’s not okay to look over their shoulder as they make their transaction. It’s okay to sit
beside someone on a crowded bus. It’s weird to sit beside a stranger in a half-empty bus.
For some breaches, the researcher directly engages with innocent bystanders. An
experimenter might strike up a conversation in a public bathroom, where it’s common to respect
each other’s privacy so fiercely as to ignore other people’s presence. In a grocery store, an
experimenter might take a food item out of another person’s grocery cart, saying, “That looks
good! I think I’ll try it.” An experimenter might sit down at a table with others in a fast food
restaurant, or follow someone around a museum, studying the same paintings. In those cases, the
bystanders are pressured to respond, and their discomfort illustrates how much we depend on
social norms. Breaching experiments uncover and explore the many unwritten social rules we live
by.
Norms may be further classified as either mores or folkways. Mores (mor-ays) are norms that
embody the moral views and principles of a group. Violating them can have serious consequences. The
strongest mores are legally protected with laws or other formal norms. In the United States, for
instance, murder is considered immoral, and it’s punishable by law (a formal norm). But more often,
mores are judged and guarded by public sentiment (an informal norm). People who violate mores are
seen as shameful. They can even be shunned or banned from some groups. The mores of the U.S.
school system require that a student’s writing be in the student’s own words or use special forms (such
as quotation marks and a whole system of citation) for crediting other writers. Writing another person’s
words as if they are one’s own has a name—plagiarism. The consequences for violating this norm are
severe, and can usually result in expulsion.
Unlike mores, folkways are norms without any moral underpinnings. Rather, folkways direct
appropriate behavior in the day-to-day practices and expressions of a culture. Folkways indicate
whether to shake hands or kiss on the cheek when greeting another person. They specify whether to
wear a tie and blazer or a T-shirt and sandals to an event. In Canada, women can smile and say hello to
men on the street. In Egypt, it’s not acceptable. In regions in the southern United States, bumping into

63

64

CHAPTER 3 | CULTURE

an acquaintance means stopping to chat. It’s considered rude not to, no matter how busy one is. In other
regions, people guard their privacy and value time efficiency. A simple nod of the head is enough.
Many folkways are actions we take for granted. People need to act without thinking to get
seamlessly through daily routines; they can’t stop and analyze every action (Sumner 1906). People who
experience culture shock may find that it subsides as they learn the new culture’s folkways and are able
to move through their daily routines more smoothly Folkways might be small manners, learned by
observation and imitated, but they are by no means trivial. Like mores and laws, these norms help
people negotiate their daily life within a given culture.

Symbols and Language
Humans, consciously and subconsciously, are always striving to make sense of their surrounding world.
Symbols—such as gestures, signs, objects, signals, and words—help people understand the world.
Symbols provide clues to understanding experiences. They convey recognizable meanings that are
shared by societies.
The world is filled with symbols. Sports uniforms, company logos, and traffic signs are symbols.
In some cultures, a gold ring is a symbol of marriage. Some symbols are highly functional; stop signs,
for instance, provide useful instruction. As physical objects, they belong to material culture, but
because they function as symbols, they also convey nonmaterial cultural meanings. Some symbols are
only valuable in what they represent. Trophies, blue ribbons, or gold medals, for example, serve no
other purpose other than to represent accomplishments. But many objects have both material and
nonmaterial symbolic value.
A police officer’s badge and uniform are symbols of authority and law enforcement. The sight of
an officer in uniform or a squad car triggers reassurance in some citizens, and annoyance, fear, or anger
in others.
It’s easy to take symbols for granted. Few people challenge or even think about stick figure signs
on the doors of public bathrooms. But those figures are more than just symbols that tell men and
women which bathrooms to use. They also uphold the value, in the United States, that public restrooms
should be gender exclusive. Even though stalls are relatively private, most places don’t offer unisex
bathrooms.

Figure 3.5 Some road signs are universal. But how would you interpret the signage on the right? (Photo (a) courtesy of
Andrew Bain/flickr; Photo (b) courtesy of HonzaSoukup/flickr)

Symbols often get noticed when they are used out of context. Used unconventionally, symbols
convey strong messages. A stop sign on the door of a corporation makes a political statement, as does a
camouflage military jacket worn in an antiwar protest. Together, the semaphore signals for “N” and “D”
represent nuclear disarmament—and form the well-known peace sign (Westcott 2008). Today, some
college students have taken to wearing pajamas and bedroom slippers to class, clothing that was
formerly associated only with privacy and bedtime. Though students might deny it, the outfit defies
traditional cultural norms and makes a statement.
Even the destruction of symbols is symbolic. Effigies representing public figures are beaten to
demonstrate anger at certain leaders. In 1989, crowds tore down the Berlin Wall, a decades-old symbol
of the division between East and West Germany, communism, and capitalism.

CHAPTER 3 | CULTURE

While different cultures have varying systems of symbols, there is one that is common to all:
language. Language is a symbolic system through which people communicate and through which
culture is transmitted. Some languages contain a system of symbols used for written communication,
while others rely only on spoken communication and nonverbal actions.
Societies often share a single language, and many languages contain the same basic elements. An
alphabet is a written system made of symbolic shapes that refer to spoken sound. Taken together, these
symbols convey specific meanings. The English alphabet uses a combination of 26 letters to create
words; these 26 letters make up over 600,000 recognized English words (OED Online 2011).
Rules for speaking and writing vary even within cultures, most notably by region. Do you refer to
a can of carbonated liquid as “soda,” pop,” or “Coke”? Is a household entertainment room a “family
room,” “rec room,” or “den”? When leaving a restaurant, do you ask your server for a “check,” the
“ticket,” or your “bill”?
Language is constantly evolving as societies create new ideas. In this age of technology, people
have adapted almost instantly to new nouns such as “e-mail” and “Internet,” and verbs such as
“downloading,” “texting,” and “blogging.” Twenty years ago, the general public would have considered
these nonsense words.
Even while it constantly evolves, language continues to shape our reality. This insight was
established in the 1920s by two linguists, Edward Sapir and Benjamin Whorf. They believed that reality
is culturally determined, and that any interpretation of reality is based on a society’s language. To prove
this point, the sociologists argued that every language has words or expressions specific to that
language. In the United States, for example, the number 13 is associated with bad luck. In Japan,
however, the number four is considered unlucky, since it is pronounced similarly to the Japanese word
for “death.”
The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is based on the idea that people experience their world through their
language, and that they therefore understand their world through the culture embedded in their
language. The hypothesis, which has also been called linguistic relativity, states that language shapes
thought (Swoyer 2003). Studies have shown, for instance, that unless people have access to the word
“ambivalent,” they don’t recognize an experience of uncertainty due to conflicting positive and
negative feelings about one issue. Essentially, the hypothesis argues, if a person can’t describe the
experience, the person is not having the experience.
In addition to using language, people communicate without words. Nonverbal communication is
symbolic, and, as in the case of language, much of it is learned through one’s culture. Some gestures are
nearly universal: smiles often represent joy and crying often represents sadness. Other nonverbal
symbols vary across cultural contexts in their meaning. A thumbs-up, for example, indicates positive
reinforcement in the United States, whereas in Russia and Australia, it is an offensive curse (Passero
2002). Other gestures vary in meaning depending on the situation and the person. A wave of the hand
can mean many things, depending on how it’s done and for whom. It may mean “hello,” “goodbye,”
“no thank you,” or “I’m royalty.” Winks convey a variety of messages, including “We have a secret,”
“I’m only kidding,” or “I’m attracted to you.” From a distance, a person can understand the emotional
gist of two people in conversation just by watching their body language and facial expressions.
Furrowed brows and folded arms indicate a serious topic, possibly an argument. Smiles, with heads
lifted and arms open, suggest a lighthearted, friendly chat.

Is the United States Bilingual?
In 1991, when she was 6 years old, Lucy Alvarez attended a school that allowed for the use of both
English and Spanish. Lucy’s teacher was bilingual, the librarian offered bilingual books, and many
of the school staff spoke both Spanish and English. Lucy and many of her classmates who spoke
only Spanish at home were lucky. According to the U.S. Census, 13.8 percent of U.S. residents
speak a non-English language at home. That’s a significant figure, but not enough to ensure that
Lucy would be encouraged to use her native language in school (Mount 2010).
Lucy’s parents, who moved to Texas from Mexico, struggled under the pressure to speak
English. Lucy might easily have gotten lost and left behind if she’d felt the same pressure in

65

66

CHAPTER 3 | CULTURE

school. In 2008, researchers from Johns Hopkins University conducted a series of studies on the
effects of bilingual education (Slavin et al. 2008). They found that students taught in both their
native tongue and English make better progress than those taught only in English.
Technically, the United States has no official language. But many believe English to be the
rightful language of the United States, and over 30 states have passed laws specifying English as
the official tongue. Proponents of English-only laws suggest that a national ruling will save money
on translation, printing, and human resource costs, including funding for bilingual teachers. They
argue that setting English as the official language will encourage non-English speakers to learn
English faster and adapt to the culture of the United States more easily (Mount 2010).
Groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) oppose making English the
official language, claiming that it violates the rights of non-English speakers. English-only laws,
they believe, deny the reality of our nation’s diversity and unfairly target Latinos and Asians. They
point to the fact that much of the debate on this topic has risen since 1970, a time when the United
States experienced new waves of immigration from Asia and Mexico.
Today, a lot of product information gets written in multiple languages. Enter a store like
Home Depot and you’ll find signs in both English and Spanish. Buy a children’s product and the
safety warnings will be presented in multiple languages. While marketers are financially motivated
to reach the largest number of consumers possible, this trend also may help people acclimate to a
culture of bilingualism.
Studies show that most American immigrants eventually abandon their native tongue and
become fluent in English. Bilingual education helps with that transition. Today, Lucy Alvarez is an
ambitious and high-achieving college student. Fluent in both English and Spanish, Lucy is
studying law enforcement, a field that seeks bilingual employees. The same bilingualism that
contributed to her success in grade school will help her thrive professionally as a law officer
serving her community.

this have on members of society? What effect does it have on our culture? (Photo courtesy of istolethetv/flickr)

3.3 Pop Culture, Subculture, and Cultural
Change
It may seem obvious that there are a multitude of cultural differences between societies in the world.
After all, we can easily see that people vary from one society to the next. It’s natural that a young
woman from rural Kenya would have a very different view of the world from an elderly man in
Mumbai—one of the most populated cities in the world. Additionally, each culture has its own internal
variations. Sometimes the differences between cultures are not nearly as large as the differences inside
cultures.

High Culture and Popular Culture
Do you prefer listening to opera or hip hop music? Do you like watching horse racing or NASCAR? Do
you read books of poetry or celebrity magazines? In each pair, one type of entertainment is considered
high-brow and the other low-brow. Sociologists use the term high culture to describe the pattern of

CHAPTER 3 | CULTURE

cultural experiences and attitudes that exist in the highest class segments of a society. People often
associate high culture with intellectualism, political power, and prestige. In America, high culture also
tends to be associated with wealth. Events considered high culture can be expensive and
formal—attending a ballet, seeing a play, or listening to a live symphony performance.
The term popular culture refers to the pattern of cultural experiences and attitudes that exist in
mainstream society. Popular culture events might include a parade, a baseball game, or the season finale
of a TV show. Rock and pop music—“pop” short for “popular”—are part of popular culture. In modern
times, popular culture is often expressed and spread via commercial media such as radio, television,
movies, the music industry, publishers, and corporate-run websites. Unlike high culture, popular culture
is known and accessible to most people. You can share a discussion of favorite football teams with a
new coworker, or comment on “American Idol” when making small talk in line at the grocery store. But
if you tried to launch into a deep discussion on the classical Greek play Antigone, few members of
American society today would be familiar with it.
Although high culture may be viewed as superior to popular culture, the labels of high culture and
popular culture vary over time and place. Shakespearean plays, considered pop culture when they were
written, are now among our society’s high culture. Five hundred years from now, will our descendants
associate watching Two and a Half Men with members of the cultural elite?

Subculture and Counterculture
A subculture is just as it sounds—a smaller cultural group within a larger culture; people of a
subculture are part of the larger culture, but also share a specific identity within a smaller group.
Thousands of subcultures exist within the United States. Ethnic and racial groups share the
language, food, and customs of their heritage. Other subcultures are united by shared experiences. Biker
culture revolves around a dedication to motorcycles. Some subcultures are formed by members who
possess traits or preferences that differ from the majority of a society’s population. The body
modification community embraces aesthetic additions to the human body, such as tattoos, piercings,
and certain forms of plastic surgery. In the United States, adolescents often form subcultures to develop
a shared youth identity. Alcoholics Anonymous offers support to those suffering from alcoholism. But
even as members of a subculture band together, they still identify with and participate in the larger
society.
Sociologists distinguish subcultures from countercultures, which are a type of subculture that
rejects some of the larger culture’s norms and values. In contrast to subcultures, which operate
relatively smoothly within the larger society, countercultures might actively defy larger society by
developing their own set of rules and norms to live by, sometimes even creating communities that
operate outside of greater society.
Cults, a word derived from culture, are also considered counterculture group. The group “Yearning
for Zion” (YFZ) in Eldorado, Texas, existed outside the mainstream, and the limelight, until its leader
was accused of statutory rape and underage marriage. The sect’s formal norms clashed too severely to
be tolerated by U.S. law, and in 2008, authorities raided the compound, removing more than two
hundred women and children from the property.

Careers in Sociology

The Evolution of American Hipster Subculture
Skinny jeans, chunky glasses, and T-shirts with vintage logos—the American hipster is a
recognizable figure in the modern United States. Based predominately in metropolitan areas,
sometimes clustered around hotspots such as the Williamsburg neighborhood in New York City,
hipsters define themselves through a rejection of the mainstream. As a subculture, hipsters spurn
many of the values and beliefs of American culture, preferring vintage clothing to fashion and a
bohemian lifestyle to one of wealth and power. While hipster culture may seem to be the new trend
among young, middle-class youth, the history of the group stretches back to the early decades of
the 1900s.
Where did the hipster culture begin? In the early 1940s, jazz music was on the rise in the
United States. Musicians were known as “hepcats” and had a smooth, relaxed quality that went

67

68

CHAPTER 3 | CULTURE

against upright, mainstream life. Those who were “hep” or “hip” lived by the code of jazz, while
those who were “square” lived according to society’s rules. The idea of a “hipster” was born.
The hipster movement spread and young people, drawn to the music and fashion, took on
attitudes and language derived from the culture of jazz. Unlike the vernacular of the day, hipster
slang was purposefully ambiguous. When hipsters said, “It’s cool, man,” they meant not that
everything was good, but that it was the way it was.

Figure 3.7 In the 1940s, American hipsters were associated with the “cool” culture of jazz. (Photo courtesy of William
P. Gottlieb/Ira and Leonore S. Gershwin Fund Collection, Music Division, Library of Congress)
By the 1950s, the jazz culture was winding down and many traits of hepcat culture were
becoming mainstream. A new subculture was on the rise. The “Beat Generation,” a title coined by
writer Jack Kerouac, were anticonformist and antimaterialistic. They were writers who listened to
jazz and embraced radical politics. They bummed around, hitchhiked the country, and lived in
squalor.
The lifestyle spread. College students, clutching copies of Kerouac’s On the Road, dressed in
berets, black turtlenecks, and black-rimmed glasses. Women wore black leotards and grew their
hair long. Herb Caen, a San Francisco journalist, used the suffix from Sputnik 1, the Russian
satellite that orbited Earth in 1957, to dub the movement’s followers “Beatniks.”
As the Beat Generation faded, a new, related movement began. It too focused on breaking
social boundaries, but also advocated freedom of expression, philosophy, and love. It took its name
from the generations before; in fact, some theorists claim that Beats themselves coined the term to
describe their children. Over time, the “little hipsters” of the 1970s became known simply as
“hippies.”
Today’s generation of hipsters rose out of the hippie movement in the same way that hippies
rose from Beats and Beats from hepcats. Although contemporary hipsters may not seem to have
much in common with 1940 hipsters, the emulation of nonconformity is still there. In 2010,
sociologist Mark Greif set about investigating the hipster subculture of the United States and found
that much of what tied the group members together was not based on fashion or musical taste or
even a specific point of contention with the mainstream. “All hipsters play at being the inventors
or first adopters of novelties,” Greif wrote. “Pride comes from knowing, and deciding, what’s cool
in advance of the rest of the world. Yet the habits of hatred and accusation are endemic to hipsters
because they feel the weakness of everyone’s position—including their own” (Greif 2010). Much
as the hepcats of jazz era opposed common culture with carefully crafted appearances of coolness
and relaxation, modern hipsters reject mainstream values with a purposeful apathy.
Young people are often drawn to oppose mainstream conventions, even if in the same way
that others do. Ironic, cool to the point of non-caring, and intellectual, hipsters continue to embody
a subculture, while simultaneously impacting mainstream culture.

Cultural Change
As the hipster example illustrates, culture is always evolving. Moreover, new things are added to
material culture every day, and they affect nonmaterial culture as well. Cultures change when
something new (say, railroads or smartphones) opens up new ways of living and when new ideas enter a
culture (say, as a result of travel or globalization).
Innovation: Discovery and Invention
An innovation refers to an object or concept’s initial appearance in society—it’s innovative because it
is markedly new. There are two ways to come across an innovative object or idea: discover it or invent
it. Discoveries make known previously unknown but existing aspects of reality. In 1610, when Galileo
looked through his telescope and discovered Saturn, the planet was already there, but until then, no one
had known about it. When Christopher Columbus encountered America, the land was, of course,
already well known to its inhabitants. However, Columbus’s discovery was new knowledge for
Europeans, and it opened the way to changes in European culture, as well as to the cultures of the
discovered lands. For example, new foods such as potatoes and tomatoes transformed the European
diet, and horses brought from Europe changed hunting practices of Native American tribes of the Great
Plains.
Inventions result when something new is formed from existing objects or concepts—when things
are put together in an entirely new manner. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, electric appliances were
invented at an astonishing pace. Cars, airplanes, vacuum cleaners, lamps, radios, telephones, and
televisions were all new inventions. Inventions may shape a culture when people use them in place of
older ways of carrying out activities and relating to others, or as a way to carry out new kinds of
activities. Their adoption reflects (and may shape) cultural values, and their use may require new norms
for new situations.
Consider the introduction of modern communication technology such as mobile phones and
smartphones. As more and more people began carrying these devices, phone conversations no longer
were restricted to homes, offices, and phone booths. People on trains, in restaurants, and in other public
places became annoyed by listening to one-sided conversations. Norms were needed for cell phone use.
Some people pushed for the idea that those who are out in the world should pay attention to their
companions and surroundings. However, technology enabled a workaround: texting, which enables
quiet communication, and has surpassed phoning as the chief way to meet today’s highly valued ability
to stay in touch anywhere, everywhere.
When the pace of innovation increases, it can lead to generation gaps. Technological gadgets that
catch on quickly with one generation are sometimes dismissed by a skeptical older generation. A
culture’s objects and ideas can cause not just generational but cultural gaps. Material culture tends to
diffuse more quickly than nonmaterial culture; technology can spread through society in a matter of
months, but it can take generations for the ideas and beliefs of society to change. Sociologist William F.
Ogburn coined the term culture lag to refer to this time that elapses between when a new item of

69

70

CHAPTER 3 | CULTURE

material culture is introduced and when it becomes an accepted part of nonmaterial culture (Ogburn
1957).
Culture lag can also cause tangible problems. The infrastructure of the United States, built a
hundred years ago or more, is having trouble supporting today’s more heavily populated and fast-paced
life. Yet there is a lag in conceptualizing solutions to infrastructure problems. Rising fuel prices,
increased air pollution, and traffic jams are all symptoms of culture lag. Although people are becoming
aware of the consequences of overusing resources, the means to support changes takes time to achieve.

Figure 3.9 Sociologist Everett Rogers (1962) developed a model of the diffusion of innovations. As consumers gradually
adopt a new innovation, the item grows toward a market share of 100 percent, or complete saturation within a society. (Graph

Diffusion and Globalization
The integration of world markets and technological advances of the last decades have allowed for
greater exchange between cultures through the processes of globalization and diffusion. Beginning in
the 1980s, Western governments began to deregulate social services while granting greater liberties to
private businesses. As a result, world markets became dominated by multinational companies in the
1980s, a new state of affairs at that time. We have since come to refer to this integration of international
trade and finance markets as globalization. Increased communications and air travel have further
opened doors for international business relations, facilitating the flow not only of goods but of
information and people as well (Scheuerman 2010). Today, many U.S. companies set up offices in other
nations where the costs of resources and labor are cheaper. When a person in the United States calls to
get information about banking, insurance, or computer services, the person taking that call may be
working in India or Indonesia.
Alongside the process of globalization is diffusion, or, the spread of material and nonmaterial
culture. While globalization refers to the integration of markets, diffusion relates a similar process to
the integration of international cultures. Middle-class Americans can fly overseas and return with a new
appreciation of Thai noodles or Italian gelato. Access to television and the Internet has brought the
lifestyles and values portrayed in American sitcoms into homes around the globe. Twitter feeds from
public demonstrations in one nation have encouraged political protesters in other countries. When this
kind of diffusion occurs, material objects and ideas from one culture are introduced into another.

3.4 Theoretical Perspectives on Culture
Music, fashion, technology, and values—all are products of culture. But what do they mean? How do
sociologists perceive and interpret culture based on these material and nonmaterial items? Let’s finish
our analysis of culture by reviewing them in the context of three theoretical perspectives: functionalism,
conflict theory, and symbolic interactionism.
Functionalists view society as a system in which all parts work—or function—together to create
society as a whole. In this way, societies need culture to exist. Cultural norms function to support the
fluid operation of society, and cultural values guide people in making choices. Just as members of a
society work together to fulfill a society’s needs, culture exists to meet its members’ basic needs.
Functionalists also study culture in terms of values. Education is an important concept in the
United States because it is valued. The culture of education—including material culture such as
classrooms, textbooks, libraries, dormitories—supports the emphasis placed on the value of educating a
society’s members.

Figure 3.11 This statue of Superman stands in the center of Metropolis, Illinois. His pedestal reads “Truth—Justice—The
American Way.” How would a functionalist interpret this statue? What does it reveal about the values of American culture?

Conflict theorists view social structure as inherently unequal, based on power differentials related
to issues like class, gender, race, and age. For a conflict theorist, culture is seen as reinforcing and
perpetuating those inequalities and differences in power. Women strive for equality in a maledominated society. Senior citizens struggle to protect their rights, their health care, and their
independence from a younger generation of lawmakers. Advocacy groups such as the American Civil
Liberties Union work to protect the rights of all races and ethnicities in the United States.

CHAPTER 3 | CULTURE

Inequalities exist within a culture’s value system. Therefore, a society’s cultural norms benefit
some people but hurt others. Some norms, formal and informal, are practiced at the expense of others.
Women were not allowed to vote in the United States until 1920. Gay and lesbian couples have been
denied the right to marry until a few recent opportunities have emerged. Racism and bigotry are very
much alive today. Although cultural diversity is supposedly valued in the United States, many people
still frown upon interracial marriages. Same-sex marriages are banned in most states, and
polygamy—common in some cultures—is unthinkable to most Americans.
At the core of conflict theory is the effect of economic production and materialism: dependence on
technology in rich nations versus a lack of technology and education in poor nations. Conflict theorists
believe that a society’s system of material production has an effect on the rest of culture. People who
have less power also have less ability to adapt to cultural change. This view contrasts with the
perspective of functionalism. In the US culture of capitalism, to illustrate, we continue to strive toward
the promise of the American dream, which perpetuates the belief that the wealthy deserve their
privileges.
Symbolic interactionism is a sociological perspective that is most concerned with the face-to-face
interactions between members of society. Interactionists see culture as being created and maintained by
the ways people interact and in how individuals interpret each other’s actions. Proponents of this theory
conceptualize human interactions as a continuous process of deriving meaning from both objects in the
environment and the actions of others. This is where the term symbolic comes into play. Every object
and action has a symbolic meaning, and language serves as a means for people to represent and
communicate their interpretations of these meanings to others. Those who believe in symbolic
interactionism perceive culture as highly dynamic and fluid, as it is dependent on how meaning is
interpreted and how individuals interact when conveying these meanings.
We began this chapter by asking what culture is. Culture is comprised of all the practices, beliefs,
and behaviors of a society. Because culture is learned, it includes how people think and express
themselves. While we may like to consider ourselves individuals, we must acknowledge the impact of
culture; we inherit thought language that shapes our perceptions and patterned behavior, including
about issues of family and friends, and faith and politics.
To an extent, culture is a social comfort. After all, sharing a similar culture with others is precisely
what defines societies. Nations would not exist if people did not coexist culturally. There could be no
societies if people did not share heritage and language, and civilization would cease to function if
people did not agree to similar values and systems of social control. Culture is preserved through
transmission from one generation to the next, but it also evolves through processes of innovation,
discovery, and cultural diffusion. We may be restricted by the confines of our own culture, but as
humans we have the ability to question values and make conscious decisions. No better evidence of this
freedom exists than the amount of cultural diversity within our own society and around the world. The
more we study another culture, the better we become at understanding our own.

CHAPTER 3 | CULTURE

Section Summary
3.1 What Is Culture?
Though “society” and “culture” are often used interchangeably, they have different meanings. A society
is a group of people sharing a community and culture. Culture generally describes the shared behaviors
and beliefs of these people, and includes material and nonmaterial elements.. Our experience of cultural
difference is influenced by our ethnocentrism and xenocentrism. Sociologists try to practice cultural
relativism.

3.2 Elements of Culture
A culture consists of many elements, such as the values and beliefs of its society. Culture is also
governed by norms, including laws, mores, and folkways. The symbols and language of a society are
key to developing and conveying culture.

3.3 Pop Culture, Subculture, and Cultural Change
Sociologists recognize high culture and popular culture within societies. Societies are also comprised of
many subcultures—smaller groups that share an identity. Countercultures reject mainstream values and
create their own cultural rules and norms. Through invention or discovery, cultures evolve via new
ideas and new ways of thinking. In many modern cultures, the cornerstone of innovation is technology,
the rapid growth of which can lead to cultural lag. Technology is also responsible for the spread of both
material and nonmaterial culture that contributes to globalization.

3.4 Theoretical Perspectives on Culture
There are three major theoretical approaches towards the interpretation of culture. A functionalist
perspective acknowledges that there are many parts of culture that work together as a system to fulfill
society’s needs. Functionalists view culture as a reflection of society’s values. Conflict theorists see
culture as inherently unequal, based upon factors like gender, class, race, and age. An interactionist is
primarily interested in culture as experienced in the daily interactions between individuals and the
symbols that comprise a culture. Various cultural and sociological occurrences can be explained by
these theories; however, there is no one “right” view through which to understand culture.

Short Answer
3.1 What Is Culture?

CHAPTER 3 | CULTURE

1. Examine the difference between material and nonmaterial culture in your world. Identify ten objects
that are part of your regular cultural experience. For each, then identify what aspects of nonmaterial
culture (values and beliefs) that these objects represent. What has this exercise revealed to you about
your culture?
2. Do you feel that feelings of ethnocentricity or xenocentricity are more prevalent in U.S. culture?
Why do you believe this? What issues or events might inform this?

3.2 Elements of Culture
3. What do you think of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis? Do you agree or disagree with it? Cite examples
or research to support your point of view.
4. How do you think your culture would exist if there were no such thing as a social “norm”? Do you
think chaos would ensue or relative peace could be kept? Explain.

3.3 Pop Culture, Subculture, and Cultural Change
5. Identify several examples of popular culture and describe how they inform larger culture. How
prevalent is the effect of these examples in your everyday life?
6. Consider some of the specific issues or concerns of your generation. Are any ideas countercultural?
What subcultures have emerged from your generation? How have the issues of your generation
expressed themselves culturally? How has your generation made its mark on society’s collective
culture?
7. What are some examples of cultural lag that are present in your life? Do you think technology affects
culture positively or negatively? Explain.

3.4 Theoretical Perspectives on Culture
8. Consider a current social trend that you have witnessed, perhaps situated around family, education,
transportation, or finances. For example, many veterans of the Armed Forces, after completing tours of
duty in the Middle East, are returning to college rather than entering jobs as veterans as previous
generations did. Choose a sociological approach—functionalism, conflict theory, or symbolic
interactionism—to describe, explain, and analyze the social issue you choose. Afterwards, determine
why you chose the approach you did. Does it suit your own way of thinking? Or did it offer the best
method to illuminate the social issue?

The Beats were a counterculture that birthed an entire movement of art, music, and literature—much of
which is still highly regarded and studied today. The man responsible for naming the generation was
Jack Kerouac; however, the man responsible for introducing the world to that generation was John
Clellon Holmes, a writer often lumped in with the group. In 1952 he penned an article for the New York
Times Magazine titled “This Is the Beat Generation.” Read that article and learn more about Clellon

Introduction to Society and Social Interaction
Early in the morning, a group of male warriors creeps out of the village and heads for the savannah.
They must be careful not to wake the other members of the tribe, lest they be accosted by the women or
elders. Once they have regrouped on the plains, the warriors begin preparing for the hunt. The eldest
members of the group choose the most qualified hunters, known as ilmeluaya, meaning men who are
not afraid of death. Warriors who are not selected are sent home in shame.
Once the select group has been chosen, the warriors begin the hunt. They scour the plains for
footprints or droppings, and search for dense bushes or tall termite mounds that might conceal their

81

82

CHAPTER 4 | SOCIETY AND SOCIAL INTERACTION

resting prey. The search can take ten minutes to ten hours, but once a lion is found, the warriors quickly
move into place.
Selected hunters ring bells and rattle the brush, forcing the lion away from its protected hiding
spot. The goal is to face the beast one-on-one on the open savannah. There will be no tricks or cheating,
simply warrior against warrior. If all goes as planned, the lion will be brought down with a single spear.
When the warriors return to the village with their trophy, it is the beginning of a weeklong
celebration. Although the hunt must be planned in secret, news of the warriors’ success spreads quickly,
and all village members come to congratulate the victors. The warrior who wounded the lion first is
honored and given a nickname based on his accomplishment. Songs are sung about the warrior, and
from now on he will be remembered and acknowledged throughout the community, even among other
tribes.
To the Maasai, lion hunting is about more than food and security. It is a way to strengthen the
bonds of community and the hierarchy among the hunters. Disputes over power are settled before the
hunt, and roles are reinforced at the end, with the bravest warrior receiving the lion’s tail as a trophy
(Maasai Association 2011). Although Maasai society is very different from contemporary America,
both share the human need to cooperate and live together in order to survive.

4.1 Types of Societies

Figure 4.2 Maasai men are hunting with shepherd’s staves and spears. How does technology influence a society’s daily
occupations? (Photo courtesy of Abir Anwar/flickr)
Maasai villagers, Tehranians, Americans—each is a society. But what does this mean? Exactly what is a
society? In sociological terms, society refers to a group of people who live in a definable community
and share the same culture. On a broader scale, society consists of the people and institutions around us,
our shared beliefs, and our cultural ideas. Typically, more advanced societies also share a political
authority.
Sociologist Gerhard Lenski (1924–) defined societies in terms of their technological
sophistication. As a society advances, so does its use of technology. Societies with rudimentary
technology depend on the fluctuations of their environment, while industrialized societies have more
control over the impact of their surroundings and thus develop different cultural features. This
distinction is so important that sociologists generally classify societies along a spectrum of their level of
industrialization, from preindustrial to industrial to postindustrial.

Preindustrial Societies
Before the Industrial Revolution and the widespread use of machines, societies were small, rural, and
dependent largely on local resources. Economic production was limited to the amount of labor a human
being could provide, and there were few specialized occupations. The very first occupation was that of
hunter-gatherer.
Hunter-Gatherer
Hunter-gatherer societies demonstrate the strongest dependence on the environment of the various
types of preindustrial societies. As the basic structure of human society until about 10,000–12,000 years
ago, these groups were based around kinship or tribes. Hunter-gatherers relied on their surroundings for
survival—they hunted wild animals and foraged for uncultivated plants for food. When resources

CHAPTER 4 | SOCIETY AND SOCIAL INTERACTION

became scarce, the group moved to a new area to find sustenance, meaning they were nomadic. These
societies were common until several hundred years ago, but today only a few hundred remain in
existence, such as indigenous Australian tribes sometimes referred to as “aborigines,” or the Bambuti, a
group of pygmy hunter-gatherers residing in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Hunter-gatherer
groups are quickly disappearing as the world’s population explodes.
Pastoral
Changing conditions and adaptations led some societies to rely on the domestication of animals where
circumstances permitted. Roughly 7,500 years ago, human societies began to recognize their ability to
tame and breed animals and to grow and cultivate their own plants. Pastoral societies rely on the
domestication of animals as a resource for survival. Unlike earlier hunter-gatherers who depended
entirely on existing resources to stay alive, pastoral groups were able to breed livestock for food,
clothing, and transportation, creating a surplus of goods. Herding, or pastoral, societies remained
nomadic because they were forced to follow their animals to fresh feeding grounds. Around the time
that pastoral societies emerged, specialized occupations began to develop, and societies commenced
trading with local groups.

Making Connections:

the

Big Picture

The Bedouin
Throughout Northern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula live the Bedouin, modern-day nomads.
While many different tribes of Bedouin exist, they all share similarities. Members migrate from
one area to another, usually in conjunction with the seasons, settling near oases in the hot summer
months. They tend to herds of goats, camels, and sheep, and they harvest dates in the fall (Kjeilen).
In recent years, there has been increased conflict between the Bedouin society and more
modernized societies. National borders are harder to cross now than in the past, making the
traditional nomadic lifestyle of the Bedouin difficult. The clash of traditions among Bedouin and
other residents has led to discrimination and abuse. Bedouin communities frequently have high
poverty and unemployment rates, and their members have little formal education (Immigration and
Refugee Board of Canada 2005).
The future of the Bedouin is uncertain. Government restrictions on farming and residence are
slowly forcing them to integrate into modern society. Although their ancestors have traversed the
deserts for thousands of years, the days of the nomadic Bedouin may be at an end.

Horticultural
Around the same time that pastoral societies were on the rise, another type of society developed, based
on the newly developed capacity for people to grow and cultivate plants. Previously, the depletion of a
region’s crops or water supply forced pastoral societies to relocate in search of food sources for their
livestock. Horticultural societies formed in areas where rainfall and other conditions allowed them to
grow stable crops. They were similar to hunter-gatherers in that they largely depended on the

CHAPTER 4 | SOCIETY AND SOCIAL INTERACTION

environment for survival, but since they didn’t have to abandon their location to follow resources, they
were able to start permanent settlements. This created more stability and more material goods and
became the basis for the first revolution in human survival.
Agricultural
While pastoral and horticultural societies used small, temporary tools such as digging sticks or hoes,
agricultural societies relied on permanent tools for survival. Around 3000 B.C.E., an explosion of new
technology known as the Agricultural Revolution made farming possible—and profitable. Farmers
learned to rotate the types of crops grown on their fields and to reuse waste products such as fertilizer,
leading to better harvests and bigger surpluses of food. New tools for digging and harvesting were made
of metal, making them more effective and longer lasting. Human settlements grew into towns and
cities, and particularly bountiful regions became centers of trade and commerce.
This is also the age in which people had the time and comfort to engage in more contemplative and
thoughtful activities, such as music, poetry, and philosophy. This period became referred to as the
“dawn of civilization” by some because of the development of leisure and humanities. Craftspeople
were able to support themselves through the production of creative, decorative, or thought-provoking
aesthetic objects and writings.
As resources became more plentiful, social classes became more divisive. Those who had more
resources could afford better living and developed into a class of nobility. Difference in social standing
between men and women increased. As cities expanded, ownership and preservation of resources
became a pressing concern.
Feudal
The ninth century gave rise to feudal societies. These societies contained a strict hierarchical system of
power based around land ownership and protection. The nobility, known as lords, placed vassals in
charge of pieces of land. In return for the resources that the land provided, vassals promised to fight for
their lords.
These individual pieces of land, known as fiefdoms, were cultivated by the lower class. In return
for maintaining the land, peasants were guaranteed a place to live and protection from outside enemies.
Power was handed down through family lines, with peasant families serving lords for generations and
generations. Ultimately, the social and economic system of feudalism would fail, replaced by capitalism
and the technological advances of the industrial era.

Industrial Society
In the 18th century, Europe experienced a dramatic rise in technological invention, ushering in an era
known as the Industrial Revolution. What made this period remarkable was the number of new
inventions that influenced people’s daily lives. Within a generation, tasks that had until this point
required months of labor became achievable in a matter of days. Before the Industrial Revolution, work
was largely person- or animal-based, relying on human workers or horses to power mills and drive
pumps. In 1782, James Watt and Matthew Boulton created a steam engine that could do the work of 12
horses by itself.
Steam power began appearing everywhere. Instead of paying artisans to painstakingly spin wool
and weave it into cloth, people turned to textile mills that produced fabric quickly at a better price, and
often with better quality. Rather than planting and harvesting fields by hand, farmers were able to
purchase mechanical seeders and threshing machines that caused agricultural productivity to soar.
Products such as paper and glass became available to the average person, and the quality and
accessibility of education and health care soared. Gas lights allowed increased visibility in the dark, and
towns and cities developed a nightlife.
One of the results of increased productivity and technology was the rise of urban centers. Workers
flocked to factories for jobs, and the populations of cities became increasingly diverse. The new
generation became less preoccupied with maintaining family land and traditions, and more focused on
acquiring wealth and achieving upward mobility for themselves and their family. People wanted their
children and their children’s children to continue to rise to the top, and as capitalism increased, so did
social mobility.
It was during the 18th and 19th centuries of the Industrial Revolution that sociology was born. Life
was changing quickly and the long-established traditions of the agricultural eras did not apply to life in
the larger cities. Masses of people were moving to new environments and often found themselves faced
with horrendous conditions of filth, overcrowding, and poverty. Social scientists emerged to study the
relationship between the individual members of society and society as a whole.

CHAPTER 4 | SOCIETY AND SOCIAL INTERACTION

It was during this time that power moved from the hands of the aristocracy and “old money” to
business-savvy newcomers who amassed fortunes in their lifetimes. Families such as the Rockefellers
and the Vanderbilts became the new power players, using their influence in business to control aspects
of government as well. Eventually, concerns over the exploitation of workers led to the formation of
labor unions and laws that set mandatory conditions for employees. Although the introduction of new
technology at the end of the 19th century ended the industrial age, much of our social structure and
social ideas—like family, childhood, and time standardization—have a basis in industrial society.

and menial laborers. By his death at age 98, he was worth $1.4 billion. In industrial societies, business owners such as
Rockefeller hold the majority of the power. (Photo courtesy of Wikimedia Commons)

Postindustrial Society
Information societies, sometimes known as postindustrial or digital societies, are a recent
development. Unlike industrial societies that are rooted in the production of material goods, information
societies are based on the production of information and services.
Digital technology is the steam engine of information societies, and computer moguls such as
Steve Jobs and Bill Gates are its John D. Rockefellers and Cornelius Vanderbilts. Since the economy of
information societies is driven by knowledge and not material goods, power lies with those in charge of
storing and distributing information. Members of a postindustrial society are likely to be employed as
sellers of services—software programmers or business consultants, for example—instead of producers
of goods. Social classes are divided by access to education, since without technical skills, people in an
information society lack the means for success.

4.2 Theoretical Perspectives on Society

CHAPTER 4 | SOCIETY AND SOCIAL INTERACTION

While many sociologists have contributed to research on society and social interaction, three thinkers
form the base of modern-day perspectives. Émile Durkheim, Karl Marx, and Max Weber developed
different theoretical approaches to help us understand the way societies function.

Émile Durkheim and Functionalism
As a functionalist, Émile Durkheim’s (1858–1917) perspective on society stressed the necessary
interconnectivity of all of its elements. To Durkheim, society was greater than the sum of its parts. He
asserted that individual behavior was not the same as collective behavior, and that studying collective
behavior was quite different from studying an individual’s actions. Durkheim called the communal
beliefs, morals, and attitudes of a society the collective conscience. In his quest to understand what
causes individuals to act in similar and predictable ways, he wrote, “If I do not submit to the
conventions of society, if in my dress I do not conform to the customs observed in my country and in
my class, the ridicule I provoke, the social isolation in which I am kept, produce, although in an
attenuated form, the same effects as punishment” (Durkheim 1895). Durkheim also believed that social
integration,or the strength of ties that people have to their social groups, was a key factor in social life.
Following the ideas of Comte and Spencer, Durkheim likened society to that of a living organism,
in which each organ plays a necessary role in keeping the being alive. Even the socially deviant
members of society are necessary, Durkheim argued, as punishments for deviance affirm established
cultural values and norms. That is, punishment of a crime reaffirms our moral consciousness. “A crime
is a crime because we condemn it,” Durkheim wrote in 1893. “An act offends the common
consciousness not because it is criminal, but it is criminal because it offends that consciousness”
(Durkheim 1893). Durkheim called these elements of society “social facts.” By this, he meant that
social forces were to be considered real and existed outside the individual.
As an observer of his social world, Durkheim was not entirely satisfied with the direction of
society in his day. His primary concern was that the cultural glue that held society together was failing,
and that people were becoming more divided. In his book The Division of Labor in Society (1893),
Durkheim argued that as society grew more complex, social order made the transition from mechanical
to organic.
Pre-industrial societies, Durkheim explained, were held together by mechanical solidarity, a type
of social order maintained by the collective consciousness of a culture. Societies with mechanical
solidarity act in a mechanical fashion; things are done mostly because they have always been done that
way. This type of thinking was common in preindustrial societies where strong bonds of kinship and a
low division of labor created shared morals and values among people, such as hunter-gatherer groups.
When people tend to do the same type of work, Durkheim argued, they tend to think and act alike.
In industrial societies, mechanical solidarity is replaced with organic solidarity, social order
based around an acceptance of economic and social differences. In capitalist societies, Durkheim wrote,
division of labor becomes so specialized that everyone is doing different things. Instead of punishing
members of a society for failure to assimilate to common values, organic solidarity allows people with
differing values to coexist. Laws exist as formalized morals and are based on restitution rather than
revenge.
While the transition from mechanical to organic solidarity is, in the long run, advantageous for a
society, Durkheim noted that it can be a time of chaos and “normlessness.” One of the outcomes of the
transition is something he called social anomie. Anomie—literally, “without law”—is a situation in
which society no longer has the support of a firm collective consciousness. Collective norms are
weakened. People, while more interdependent to accomplish complex tasks, are also alienated from
each other. Anomie is experienced in times of social uncertainty, such as war, or a great upturn or
downturn in the economy. As societies reach an advanced stage of organic solidarity, they avoid anomie
by redeveloping a set of shared norms. According to Durkheim, once a society achieves organic
solidarity, it has finished its development.

Karl Marx and Conflict Theory
Karl Marx (1818–1883) is certainly among the most significant social thinkers in recent history. While
there are many critics of his work, it is still widely respected and influential. For Marx, society’s
constructions were predicated upon the idea of “base and superstructure.” This term refers to the idea
that a society’s economic character forms its base, upon which rests the culture and social institutions,
the superstructure. For Marx, it is the base (economy) that determines what a society will be like.

CHAPTER 4 | SOCIETY AND SOCIAL INTERACTION

Figure 4.6 Karl Marx asserted that all elements of a society’s structure depend on its economic structure.
Additionally, Marx saw conflict in society as the primary means of change. Economically, he saw
conflict existing between the owners of the means of production—the bourgeoisie—and the laborers,
called the proletariat.
Marx maintained that these conflicts appeared consistently throughout history during times of
social revolution. These revolutions or “class antagonisms” as he called them, were a result of one class
dominating another. Most recently, with the end of feudalism, a new revolutionary class he called the
bourgeoisie dominated the proletariat laborers. The bourgeoisie were revolutionary in the sense that
they represented a radical change in the structure of society. In Marx’s words, “Society as a whole is
more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes directly facing each
other—Bourgeoisie and Proletariat” (Marx and Engels 1848).
In the mid-19th century, as industrialization was booming, labor became more and more
exploitative of the working class. The large manufacturers of steel were particularly ruthless, and their
facilities became popularly dubbed “satanic mills” based on a poem by William Blake. Marx’s
colleague and friend, Frederick Engels, wrote The Condition of the Working-Class in England in 1844,
which described in detail the horrid conditions.
Such is the Old Town of Manchester, and on re-reading my description, I am forced
to admit that instead of being exaggerated, it is far from black enough to convey a
true impression of the filth, ruin, and uninhabitableness, the defiance of all
considerations of cleanliness, ventilation, and health which characterise the
construction of this single district, containing at least twenty to thirty thousand
inhabitants. And such a district exists in the heart of the second city of England, the
first manufacturing city of the world.
Add to that the long hours, the use of child labor, and exposure to extreme conditions of heat, cold,
and toxic chemicals, and it is no wonder that Marx and Engels referred to capitalism as the
“dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.”

CHAPTER 4 | SOCIETY AND SOCIAL INTERACTION

For Marx, what we do defines who we are. In historical terms, in spite of the persistent nature of
one class dominating another, some element of humanity existed. There was at least some connection
between the worker and the product, augmented by the natural conditions of seasons and the rise and
fall of the sun, such as we see in an agricultural society. But with the bourgeoisie revolution and the rise
of industry and capitalism, the worker now worked for wages alone. His relationship to his efforts was
no longer of a human nature, but based on artificial conditions.
Marx described modern society in terms of alienation. Alienation refers to the condition in which
the individual is isolated and divorced from his or her society, work, or the sense of self. Marx defined
four specific types of alienation.
Alienation from the product of one’s labor.An industrial worker does not have the opportunity to
relate to the product he is laboring on. Instead of training for years as a watchmaker, an unskilled
worker can get a job at a watch factory pressing buttons to seal pieces together. The worker does not
care if he is making watches or cars, simply that the job exists. In the same way, a worker may not even
know or care what product he is contributing to. A worker on a Ford assembly line may spend all day
installing windows on car doors without ever seeing the rest of the car. A cannery worker can spend a
lifetime cleaning fish without ever knowing what product they are used for.
Alienation from the process of one’s labor. A worker does not control the conditions of her job
because she does not own the means of production. If a person is hired to work in a fast food restaurant,
she is expected to make the food the way she is taught. All ingredients must be combined in a particular
order and in a particular quantity; there is no room for creativity or change. An employee at Burger
King cannot decide to change the spices used on the fries in the same way that an employee on a Ford
assembly line cannot decide to place a car’s headlights in a different position. Everything is decided by
the bourgeoisie who then dictate orders to the laborers.
Alienation from others. Workers compete, rather than cooperate. Employees vie for time slots,
bonuses, and job security. Even when a worker clocks out at night and goes home, the competition does
not end. As Marx commented in The Communist Manifesto(1848), “No sooner is the exploitation of the
laborer by the manufacturer, so far at an end, that he receives his wages in cash, than he is set upon by
the other portion of the bourgeoisie, the landlord, the shopkeeper, the pawnbroker.”
Alienation from one’s self. A final outcome of industrialization is a loss of connectivity between a
worker and her occupation. Because there is nothing that ties a worker to her labor, there is no longer a
sense of self. Instead of being able to take pride in an identity such as being a watchmaker, automobile
builder, or chef, a person is simply a cog in the machine.
Taken as a whole, then, alienation in modern society means that an individual has no control over
his life. Even in feudal societies, a person controlled the manner of his labor as to when and how it was
carried out. But why, then, does the modern working class not rise up and rebel? (Indeed, Marx
predicted that this would be the ultimate outcome and collapse of capitalism.)
Another idea that Marx developed is the concept of false consciousness. False consciousness is a
condition in which the beliefs, ideals, or ideology of a person are not in the person’s own best interest.
In fact, it is the ideology of the dominant class (here, the bourgeoisie capitalists) that is imposed upon
the proletariat. Ideas such as the emphasis of competition over cooperation, or of hard work being its
own reward, clearly benefit the owners of industry. Therefore, workers are less likely to question their
place in society and assume individual responsibility for existing conditions.
In order for society to overcome false consciousness, Marx proposed that it be replaced with class
consciousness, the awareness of one’s rank in society. Instead of existing as a “class in itself,” the
proletariat must become a “class for itself” in order to produce social change (Marx and Engels 1848),
meaning that instead of just being an inert strata of society, the class could become an advocate for
social improvements. Only once society entered this state of political consciousness would it be ready
for a social revolution.

Max Weber and Symbolic Interactionism
While Karl Marx may be one of the best-known thinkers of the 19th century, Max Weber is certainly
one of the greatest influences in the field of sociology. Like the other social thinkers discussed here, he
was concerned with the important changes taking place in Western society with the advent of
industrialization. And, like Marx and Durkheim, he feared that industrialization would have negative
effects on individuals.
Weber’s primary focus on the structure of society lay in the elements of class, status, and power.
Similar to Marx, Weber saw class as economically determined. Society, he believed, was split between
owners and laborers. Status, on the other hand, was based on noneconomic factors such as education,
kinship, and religion. Both status and class determined an individual’s power, or influence over ideas.
Unlike Marx, Weber believed that these ideas formed the base of society.
Weber’s analysis of modern society centered on the concept of rationalization. A rational society
is one built around logic and efficiency rather than morality or tradition. To Weber, capitalism is
entirely rational. Although this leads to efficiency and merit-based success, it can have negative effects
when taken to the extreme. In some modern societies, this is seen when rigid routines and strict design
lead to a mechanized work environment and a focus on producing identical products in every location.
Another example of the extreme conditions of rationality can be found in Charlie Chaplin’s classic
film Modern Times (1936). Chaplin’s character performs a routine task to the point where he cannot
stop his motions even while away from the job. Indeed, today we even have a recognized medical
condition that results from such tasks, known as “repetitive stress syndrome.”
Weber was also unlike his predecessors in that he was more interested in how individuals
experienced societal divisions than in the divisions themselves. The symbolic interactionism theory, the
third of the three most recognized theories of sociology, is based on Weber’s early ideas that emphasize
the viewpoint of the individual and how that individual relates to society. For Weber, the culmination of
industrialization, rationalization, and the like results in what he referred to as the iron cage, in which
the individual is trapped by institutions and bureaucracy. This leads to a sense of “disenchantment of
the world,” a phrase Weber used to describe the final condition of humanity. Indeed a dark prediction,
but one that has, at least to some degree, been borne out (Gerth and Mills 1918). In a rationalized,
modern society, we have supermarkets instead of family-owned stores. We have chain restaurants
instead of local eateries. Superstores that offer a multitude of merchandise have replaced independent
businesses that focused on one product line, such as hardware, groceries, automotive repair, or clothing.
Shopping malls offer retail stores, restaurants, fitness centers, even condominiums. This change may be
rational, but is it universally desirable?

Making Connections:

Sociological Research

The Protestant Work Ethic
In a series of essays in 1904, Weber presented the idea of the Protestant work ethic, a new attitude
toward work based on the Calvinist principle of predestination. In the 16th century, Europe was
shaken by the Protestant Revolution. Religious leaders such as Martin Luther and John Calvin
argued against the Catholic Church’s belief in salvation through obedience. While Catholic leaders
emphasized the importance of religious dogma and performing good deeds as a gateway to heaven,
Protestants believed that inner grace, or faith in God, was enough to achieve salvation.
John Calvin in particular popularized the Christian concept of predestination, the idea that all
events—including salvation—have already been decided by God. Because followers were never
sure whether they had been chosen to enter Heaven or Hell, they looked for signs in their everyday
lives. If a person was hard-working and successful, he was likely to be one of the chosen. If a
person was lazy or simply indifferent, he was likely to be one of the damned.
Weber argued that this mentality encouraged people to work hard for personal gain; after all,
why should one help the unfortunate if they were already damned? Over time, the Protestant work
ethic spread and became the foundation for capitalism.

4.3 Social Constructions of Reality

Figure 4.10 Who are we? What role do we play in society? According to sociologists, we construct reality through our
interactions with others. In a way, our day-to-day interactions are like those of actors on a stage. (Photo courtesy of Jan
Lewandowski/flickr)

CHAPTER 4 | SOCIETY AND SOCIAL INTERACTION

Until now, we’ve primarily discussed the differences between societies. Rather than discuss their
problems and configurations, we’ll now explore how society came to be and how sociologists view
social interaction.
In 1966 sociologists Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann wrote a book called The Social
Construction of Reality. In it, they argued that society is created by humans and human interaction,
which they call habitualization. Habitualization describes how “any action that is repeated frequently
becomes cast into a pattern, which can then be … performed again in the future in the same manner and
with the same economical effort” (Berger and Luckmann 1966). Not only do we construct our own
society, but we accept it as it is because others have created it before us. Society is, in fact, “habit.”
For example, your school exists as a school and not just as a building because you and others agree
that it is a school. If your school is older than you are, it was created by the agreement of others before
you. In a sense, it exists by consensus, both prior and current. This is an example of the process of
institutionalization, the act of implanting a convention or norm into society. Bear in mind that the
institution, while socially constructed, is still quite real.
Another way of looking at this concept is through W.I. Thomas’s notable Thomas theorem which
states, “If men define situations as real, they are real in their consequences” (Thomas and Thomas
1928). That is, people’s behavior can be determined by their subjective construction of reality rather
than by objective reality. For example, a teenager who is repeatedly given a label—overachiever,
player, bum—might live up to the term even though it initially wasn’t a part of his character.
Like Berger and Luckmann’s description of habitualization, Thomas states that our moral codes
and social norms are created by “successive definitions of the situation.” This concept is defined by
sociologist Robert K. Merton as a self-fulfilling prophecy. Merton explains that with a self-fulfilling
prophecy, even a false idea can become true if it is acted upon. One example he gives is of a “bank
run.” Say for some reason, a number of people falsely fear that their bank is soon to be bankrupt.
Because of this false notion, people run to their bank and demand all their cash at once. As banks rarely,
if ever, have that much money on hand, the bank does indeed run out of money, fulfilling the
customers’ prophecy. Here, reality is constructed by an idea.
Symbolic interactionists offer another lens through which to analyze the social construction of
reality. With a theoretical perspective focused on the symbols (like language, gestures, and artifacts)
that people use to interact, this approach is interested in how people interpret those symbols in daily
interactions. For example, we might feel fright at seeing a person holding a gun, unless, of course, it
turns out to be a police officer. Interactionists also recognize that language and body language reflect
our values. One has only to learn a foreign tongue to know that not every English word can be easily
translated into another language. The same is true for gestures. While Americans might recognize a
“thumbs up” as meaning “great,” in Germany it would mean “one” and in Japan it would mean “five.”
Thus, our construction of reality is influenced by our symbolic interactions.

Figure 4.11 The story line of a self-fulfilling prophecy appears in many literary works, perhaps most famously in the story
of Oedipus. Oedipus is told by an oracle that he will murder his father and marry his mother. In going out of his way to avoid his
fate, Oedipus inadvertently fulfills it. Oedipus’s story illustrates one way in which members of society contribute to the social
construction of reality. (Photo courtesy of Jean-Antoine-Theodore Giroust/Wikimedia Commons)

Roles and Status
As you can imagine, people employ many types of behaviors in day-to-day life. Roles are patterns of
behavior that we recognize in each other that are representative of a person’s social status. Currently,
while reading this text, you are playing the role of a student. However, you also play other roles in your

91

92

CHAPTER 4 | SOCIETY AND SOCIAL INTERACTION

life, such as “daughter,” “neighbor,” or “employee.” These various roles are each associated with a
different status.
Sociologists use the term status to describe the responsibilities and benefits a person experiences
according to their rank and role in society. Some statuses are ascribed—those you do not select, such as
son, elderly person, or female. Others, called achieved statuses, are obtained by choice, such as a high
school dropout, self-made millionaire, or nurse. As a daughter or son, you occupy a different status than
as a neighbor or employee. One person can be associated with a multitude of roles and statuses. Even a
single status such as “student” has a complex role-set, or array of roles, attached to it (Merton 1957).
If too much is required of a single role, individuals can experience role strain. Consider the duties
of a parent: cooking, cleaning, driving, problem-solving, acting as a source of moral guidance—the list
goes on. Similarly, a person can experience role conflict when one or more roles are contradictory. A
parent who also has a full-time career can experience role conflict on a daily basis. When there is a
deadline at the office but a sick child needs to be picked up from school, which comes first? When you
are working toward a promotion but your children want you to come to their school play, which do you
choose? Being a college student can conflict with being an employee, being an athlete, or even being a
friend. Our roles in life have a great effect on our decisions and who we become.

Presentation of Self
Of course, it is impossible to look inside a person’s head and study what role they are playing. All we
can observe is behavior, or role performance. Role performance is how a person expresses his or her
role. Sociologist Erving Goffman presented the idea that a person is like an actor on a stage. Calling his
theory dramaturgy, Goffman believed that we use “impression management” to present ourselves to
others as we hope to be perceived. Each situation is a new scene, and individuals perform different roles
depending on who is present (Goffman 1959). Think about the way you behave around your coworkers
versus the way you behave around your grandparents versus the way you behave with a blind date.
Even if you’re not consciously trying to alter your personality, your grandparents, coworkers, and date
probably see different sides of you.
As in a play, the setting matters as well. If you have a group of friends over to your house for
dinner, you are playing the role of a host. It is agreed upon that you will provide food and seating and
probably be stuck with a lot of the cleanup at the end of the night. Similarly, your friends are playing
the roles of guests, and they are expected to respect your property and any rules you may set forth
(“Don’t leave the door open or the cat will get out.”). In any scene, there needs to be a shared reality
between players. In this case, if you view yourself as a guest and others view you as a host, there are
likely to be problems.
Impression management is a critical component of symbolic interactionism. For example, a judge
in a courtroom has many “props” to create an impression of fairness, gravity, and control—like her robe
and gavel. Those entering the courtroom are expected to adhere to the scene being set. Just imagine the
“impression” that can be made by how a person dresses. This is the reason that attorneys frequently
select the hairstyle and apparel for witnesses and defendants in courtroom proceedings.

Figure 4.12 A courtroom exemplifies a scene where all players have clearly defined roles and expected performances.

Goffman’s dramaturgy ideas expand on the ideas of Charles Cooley and the looking-glass self.
According to Cooley, we base our image on what we think other people see (Cooley 1902). We imagine
how we must appear to others, then react to this speculation. We don certain clothes, prepare our hair in

CHAPTER 4 | SOCIETY AND SOCIAL INTERACTION

a particular manner, wear makeup, use cologne, and the like—all with the notion that our presentation
of ourselves is going to affect how others perceive us. We expect a certain reaction, and, if lucky, we get
the one we desire and feel good about it. But more than that, Cooley believed that our sense of self is
based upon this idea: we imagine how we look to others, draw conclusions based upon their reactions to
us, and then we develop our personal sense of self. In other words, people’s reactions to us are like a
mirror in which we are reflected.

Section Summary
4.1 Types of Societies
Societies are classified according to their development and use of technology. For most of human
history, people lived in preindustrial societies characterized by limited technology and low production
of goods. After the Industrial Revolution, many societies based their economies around mechanized
labor, leading to greater profits and a trend toward greater social mobility. At the turn of the new
millennium, a new type of society emerged. This postindustrial, or information, society is built on
digital technology and non-material goods.

4.2 Theoretical Perspectives on Society
Émile Durkheim believed that as societies advance, they make the transition from mechanical to
organic solidarity. For Karl Marx, society exists in terms of class conflict. With the rise of capitalism,
workers become alienated from themselves and others in society. Sociologist Max Weber noted that the
rationalization of society can be taken to unhealthy extremes.

4.3 Social Constructions of Reality
Society is based on the social construction of reality. How we define society influences how society
actually is. Likewise, how we see other people influences their actions as well as our actions toward
them. We all take on various roles throughout our lives, and our social interactions depend on what
types of roles we assume, who we assume them with, and the scene where interaction takes place.

Introduction to Socialization
In the summer of 2005, police detective Mark Holste followed an investigator from the Department of
Children and Families to a home in Plant City, Florida. They were there to look into a statement from
the neighbor concerning a shabby house on Old Sydney Road. A small girl was reported peering from
one of its broken windows. This seemed odd because no one in the neighborhood had seen a young
child in or around the home, which had been inhabited for the past three years by a woman, her
boyfriend, and two adult sons.
Who was the mystery girl in the window?

100

CHAPTER 5 | SOCIALIZATION

Entering the house, Detective Holste and his team were shocked. It was the worst mess they’d ever
seen, infested with cockroaches, smeared with feces and urine from both people and pets, and filled
with dilapidated furniture and ragged window coverings.
Detective Holste headed down a hallway and entered a small room. That’s where he found the
little girl, with big, vacant eyes, staring into the darkness. A newspaper report later described the
detective’s first encounter with the child: “She lay on a torn, moldy mattress on the floor. She was
curled on her side . . . her ribs and collarbone jutted out . . . her black hair was matted, crawling with
lice. Insect bites, rashes and sores pocked her skin . . . She was naked—except for a swollen diaper. …
Her name, her mother said, was Danielle. She was almost seven years old” (DeGregory 2008).
Detective Holste immediately carried Danielle out of the home. She was taken to a hospital for
medical treatment and evaluation. Through extensive testing, doctors determined that, although she was
severely malnourished, Danielle was able to see, hear, and vocalize normally. Still, she wouldn’t look
anyone in the eyes, didn’t know how to chew or swallow solid food, didn’t cry, didn’t respond to
stimuli that would typically cause pain, and didn’t know how to communicate either with words or
simple gestures such as nodding “yes” or “no.” Likewise, although tests showed she had no chronic
diseases or genetic abnormalities, the only way she could stand was with someone holding onto her
hands, and she “walked sideways on her toes, like a crab” (DeGregory 2008).
What had happened to Danielle? Put simply: beyond the basic requirements for survival, she had
been neglected. Based on their investigation, social workers concluded that she had been left almost
entirely alone in rooms like the one where she was found. Without regular interaction—the holding,
hugging, talking, the explanations and demonstrations given to most young children—she had not
learned to walk or to speak, to eat or to interact, to play or even to understand the world around her.
From a sociological point of view, Danielle had not had been socialized.
Socialization is the process through which people are taught to be proficient members of a society.
It describes the ways that people come to understand societal norms and expectations, to accept
society’s beliefs, and to be aware of societal values. Socialization is not the same as socializing
(interacting with others, like family, friends, and coworkers); to be precise, it is a sociological process
that occurs through socializing. As Danielle’s story illustrates, even the most basic of human activities
are learned. You may be surprised to know that even physical tasks like sitting, standing, and walking
had not automatically developed for Danielle as she grew. And without socialization, Danielle hadn’t
learned about the material culture of her society (the tangible objects a culture uses): for example, she
couldn’t hold a spoon, bounce a ball, or use a chair for sitting. She also hadn’t learned its nonmaterial
culture, such as its beliefs, values, and norms. She had no understanding of the concept of “family,”
didn’t know cultural expectations for using a bathroom for elimination, and had no sense of modesty.
Most importantly, she hadn’t learned to use the symbols that make up language—through which we
learn about who we are, how we fit with other people, and the natural and social worlds in which we
live.
Sociologists have long been fascinated by circumstances like Danielle’s—in which a child receives
sufficient human support to survive, but virtually no social interaction—because they highlight how
much we depend on social interaction to provide the information and skills that we need to be part of
society or even to develop a “self.”
The necessity for early social contact was demonstrated by the research of Harry and Margaret
Harlow. From 1957 to 1963, the Harlows conducted a series of experiments studying how rhesus
monkeys, which behave a lot like people, are affected by isolation as babies. They studied monkeys
raised under two types of “substitute” mothering circumstances: a mesh and wire sculpture, or a soft
terrycloth “mother.” The monkeys systematically preferred the company of a soft, terrycloth substitute
mother (closely resembling a rhesus monkey) that was unable to feed them, to a mesh and wire mother
that provided sustenance via a feeding tube. This demonstrated that while food was important, social
comfort was of greater value (Harlow and Harlow 1962; Harlow 1971). Later experiments testing more
severe isolation revealed that such deprivation of social contact led to significant developmental and
social challenges later in life.

In the following sections, we will examine the importance of the complex process of socialization
and how it takes place through interaction with many individuals, groups, and social institutions. We
will explore how socialization is not only critical to children as they develop, but how it is a lifelong
process through which we become prepared for new social environments and expectations in every
stage of our lives. But first, we will turn to scholarship about self development, the process of coming
to recognize a sense of self, a “self” that is then able to be socialized.

5.1 Theories of Self Development
When we are born, we have a genetic makeup and biological traits. However, who we are as human
beings develops through social interaction. Many scholars, both in the fields of psychology and in
sociology, have described the process of self development as a precursor to understanding how that
“self” becomes socialized.

Psychological Perspectives on Self-Development
Psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud (1856–1939) was one of the most influential modern scientists to put
forth a theory about how people develop a sense of self. He believed that personality and sexual
development were closely linked, and he divided the maturation process into psychosexual stages: oral,
anal, phallic, latency, and genital. He posited that people’s self development is closely linked to early
stages of development, like breastfeeding, toilet training, and sexual awareness (Freud 1905).
According to Freud, failure to properly engage in or disengage from a specific stage results in
emotional and psychological consequences throughout adulthood. An adult with an oral fixation may
indulge in overeating or binge drinking. An anal fixation may produce a neat freak (hence the term
“anal retentive”), while a person stuck in the phallic stage may be promiscuous or emotionally
immature. Although no solid empirical evidence supports Freud’s theory, his ideas continue to
contribute to the work of scholars in a variety of disciplines.

Sociology or Psychology: What’s the
Difference?
You might be wondering: if sociologists and psychologists are both interested in people and their
behavior, how are these two disciplines different? What do they agree on, and where do their ideas
diverge? The answers are complicated, but the distinction is important to scholars in both fields.
As a general difference, we might say that while both disciplines are interested in human
behavior, psychologists are focused on how the mind influences that behavior, while sociologists
study the role of society in shaping behavior. Psychologists are interested in people’s mental
development and how their minds process their world. Sociologists are more likely to focus on

101

102

CHAPTER 5 | SOCIALIZATION

how different aspects of society contribute to an individual’s relationship with his world. Another
way to think of the difference is that psychologists tend to look inward (mental health, emotional
processes), while sociologists tend to look outward (social institutions, cultural norms, interactions
with others) to understand human behavior.
Emile Durkheim (1958–1917) was the first to make this distinction in research, when he
attributed differences in suicide rates among people to social causes (religious differences) rather
than to psychological causes (like their mental wellbeing) (Durkheim 1897). Today, we see this
same distinction. For example, a sociologist studying how a couple gets to the point of their first
kiss on a date might focus her research on cultural norms for dating, social patterns of sexual
activity over time, or how this process is different for seniors than for teens. A psychologist would
more likely be interested in the person’s earliest sexual awareness or the mental processing of
sexual desire.
Sometimes sociologists and psychologists have collaborated to increase knowledge. In recent
decades, however, their fields have become more clearly separated as sociologists increasingly
focus on large societal issues and patterns, while psychologists remain honed in on the human
mind. Both disciplines make valuable contributions through different approaches that provide us
with different types of useful insights.
Psychologist Erik Erikson (1902–1994) created a theory of personality development based, in part,
on the work of Freud. However, Erikson believed the personality continued to change over time and
was never truly finished. His theory includes eight stages of development, beginning with birth and
ending with death. According to Erikson, people move through these stages throughout their lives. In
contrast to Freud’s focus on psychosexual stages and basic human urges, Erikson’s view of self
development gave credit to more social aspects, like the way we negotiate between our own base
desires and what is socially accepted (Erikson 1982).
Jean Piaget (1896–1980) was a psychologist who specialized in child development, focusing
specifically on the role of social interactions in their development. He recognized that the development
of self evolved through a negotiation between the world as it exists in one’s mind and the world that
exists as it is experienced socially (Piaget 1954). All three of these thinkers have contributed to our
modern understanding of self development.

Sociological Theories of Self Development
One of the pioneering contributors to sociological perspectives was Charles Cooley (1864–1929). He
asserted that people’s self understanding is constructed, in part, by their perception of how others view
them—a process termed “the looking glass self” (Cooley 1902).
Later, George Herbert Mead (1863–1931) studied the self, a person’s distinct identity that is
developed through social interaction. In order to engage in this process of “self,” an individual has to be
able to view him or herself through the eyes of others. That’s not an ability that we are born with (Mead
1934). The case of Danielle, for example, illustrates what happens when social interaction is absent
from early experience: she had no ability to see herself as others would see her. From Mead’s point of
view, she had no “self.”
How do we get from being newborns to being humans with “selves?” Mead believed that there is a
specific path of development that all people go through. During the preparatory stage, children are only
capable of imitation: they have no ability to imagine how others see things. They copy the actions of
people with whom they regularly interact, such as their mothers and fathers. This is followed by the
play stage, during which children begin to take on the role that one other person might have. Thus,
children might try on a parent’s point of view by acting out “grownup” behavior, like playing “dress
up” and acting out the “mom” role, or talking on a toy telephone the way they see their father do.
During the game stage, children learn to consider several roles at the same time and how those
roles interact with each other. They learn to understand interactions involving different people with a
variety of purposes. For example, a child at this is likely to be aware of the different responsibilities of
people in a restaurant who together make for a smooth dining experience (someone seats you, another
takes your order, someone else cooks the food, while yet another clears away dirty dishes).
Finally, children develop, understand, and learn the idea of the generalized other, the common
behavioral expectations of general society. By this stage of development, an individual is able to
imagine how he or she is viewed by one or many others—and thus, from a sociological perspective, to
have a “self” (Mead 1934; Mead 1964).

CHAPTER 5 | SOCIALIZATION

Kohlberg’s Theory of Moral Development
Moral development is an important part of the socialization process. The term refers to the way people
learn what society considered to be “good” and “bad,” which is important for a smoothly functioning
society. Moral development prevents people from acting on unchecked urges, instead considering what
is right for society and good for others. Lawrence Kohlberg (1927–1987) was interested in how people
learn to decide what is right and what is wrong. To understand this topic, he developed a theory of
moral development that includes three levels: preconventional, conventional, and postconventional.
In the preconventional stage, young children, who lack a higher level of cognitive ability,
experience the world around them only through their senses. It isn’t until the teen years that the
conventional theory develops, when youngsters become increasingly aware of others’ feelings and take
those into consideration when determining what’s “good” and “bad.” The final stage, called
postconventional, is when people begin to think of morality in abstract terms, such as Americans
believing that everyone has the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. At this stage, people
also recognize that legality and morality do not always match up evenly (Kohlberg 1981). When
hundreds of thousands of Egyptians turned out in 2011 to protest government corruption, they were
using postconventional morality. They understood that although their government was legal, it was not
morally correct.
Gilligan’s Theory of Moral Development and Gender
Another sociologist, Carol Gilligan (1936–), recognized that Kohlberg’s theory might show gender bias
since his research was only conducted on male subjects. Would females study subjects have responded
differently? Would a female social scientist notice different patterns when analyzing the research? To
answer the first question, she set out to study differences between how boys and girls developed
morality. Gilligan’s research demonstrated that boys and girls do, in fact, have different understandings
of morality. Boys tend to have a justice perspective, placing emphasis on rules and laws. Girls, on the
other hand, have a care and responsibility perspective; they consider people’s reasons behind behavior
that seems morally wrong.
Gilligan also recognized that Kohlberg’s theory rested on the assumption that the justice
perspective was the right, or better, perspective. Gilligan, in contrast, theorized that neither perspective
was “better”: the two norms of justice served different purposes. Ultimately, she explained that boys are
socialized for a work environment where rules make operations run smoothly, while girls are socialized
for a home environment where flexibility allows for harmony in caretaking and nurturing (Gilligan
1982; Gilligan 1990).

Sociology

in the

Real World

What a Pretty Little Lady!
“What a cute dress!” “I like the ribbons in your hair.” “Wow, you look so pretty today.”
According to Lisa Bloom, author of Think: Straight Talk for Women to Stay Smart in a
Dumbed Down World, most of us use pleasantries like these when we first meet little girls. “So
what?” you might ask.
Bloom asserts that we are too focused on the appearance of young girls, and as a result, our
society is socializing them to believe that how they look is of vital importance. And Bloom may be
on to something. How often do you tell a little boy how attractive his outfit is, how nice looking
his shoes are, or how handsome he looks today? To support her assertions, Bloom cites, as one
example, that about 50 percent of girls ages three to six worry about being fat (Bloom 2011).
We’re talking kindergarteners who are concerned about their body image. Sociologists are acutely
interested in of this type of gender socialization, where societal expectations of how boys and girls
should be—how they should behave, what toys and colors they should like, and how important
their attire is—are reinforced.
One solution to this type of gender socialization is being experimented with at the Egalia
preschool in Sweden, where children develop in a genderless environment. All of the children at
Egalia are referred to with neutral terms like “friend” instead of “he” or “she.” Play areas and toys
are consciously set up to eliminate any reinforcement of gender expectations (Haney 2011). Egalia
strives to eliminate all societal gender norms from these children’s preschool world.

CHAPTER 5 | SOCIALIZATION

Extreme? Perhaps. So what is the middle ground? Bloom suggests that we start with simple
steps: when introduced to a young girl, ask about her favorite book or what she likes. In short,
engage her mind … not her outward appearance (Bloom 2011).

5.2 Why Socialization Matters
Socialization is critical both to individuals and to the societies in which they live. It illustrates how
completely intertwined human beings and their social worlds are. First, it is through teaching culture to
new members that a society perpetuates itself. If new generations of a society don’t learn its way of life,
it ceases to exist. Whatever is distinctive about a culture must be transmitted to those who join it in
order for a society to survive. For American culture to continue, for example, children in the United
States must learn about cultural values related to democracy: they have to learn the norms of voting, as
well as how to use material objects such as voting machines. Of course, some would argue that it’s just
as important in American culture for the younger generation to learn the etiquette of eating in a
restaurant or the rituals of tailgate parties at football games. In fact, there are many ideas and objects
that Americans teach children in hopes of keeping the society’s way of life going through another
generation.

Figure 5.3 Socialization teaches us our society’s expectations for dining out. The manners and customs of different
cultures (When can you use your hands to eat? How should you compliment the cook? Who is the “head” of the table?) are
learned through socialization. (Photo courtesy of Niyam Bhushan/flickr)
Socialization is just as essential to us as individuals. Social interaction provides the means via
which we gradually become able to see ourselves through the eyes of others, learning who we are and
how we fit into the world around us. In addition, to function successfully in society, we have to learn
the basics of both material land nonmaterial culture, everything from how to dress ourselves to what’s
suitable attire for a specific occasion; from when we sleep to what we sleep on; and from what’s
considered appropriate to eat for dinner to how to use the stove to prepare it. Most importantly, we have
to learn language—whether it’s the dominant language or one common in a subculture, whether it’s
verbal or through signs—in order to communicate and to think. As we saw with Danielle, without
socialization we literally have no self.

Nature versus Nurture
Some experts assert that who we are is a result of nurture—the relationships and caring that surround
us. Others argue that who we are is based entirely in genetics. According to this belief, our
temperaments, interests, and talents are set before birth. From this perspective, then, who we are
depends on nature.
One way that researchers attempt to prove the impact of nature is by studying twins. Some studies
followed identical twins who were raised separately. The pairs shared the same genetics, but, in some
cases, were socialized in different ways. Instances of this type of situation are rare, but studying the
degree to which identical twins raised apart are the same and different can give researchers insight into
how our temperaments, preferences, and abilities are shaped by our genetic makeup versus our social
environment.
For example, in 1968, twin girls born to a mentally ill mother were put up for adoption. However,
they were also separated from each other and raised in different households. The parents, and certainly
the babies, did not realize they were one of five pairs of twins who were made subjects of a scientific
study (Flam 2007).

CHAPTER 5 | SOCIALIZATION

In 2003, the two women, then age 35, reunited. Elyse Schein and Paula Bernstein sat together in
awe, feeling like they were looking into a mirror. Not only did they look alike, but they behaved alike,
using the same hand gestures and facial expressions (Spratling 2007). Studies like these point to the
genetic roots of our temperament and behavior.
Though genetics and hormones play an important role in human behavior, sociology’s larger
concern is the effect that society has on human behavior, the “nurture” side of the nature versus nurture
debate. What race were the twins? From what social class were their parents? What about gender?
Religion? All of these factors affect the lives of the twins as much as their genetic makeup and are
critical to consider as we look at life through the sociological lens.

Careers in Sociology

The Life of Chris Langan, the Smartest Man
You’ve Never Heard Of
Bouncer. Firefighter. Factory worker. Cowboy. Chris Langan spent the majority of his adult life
just getting by with jobs like these. He had no college degree, few resources, and a past filled with
much disappointment. Chris Langan also had an IQ of over 195, nearly 100 points higher than the
average person (Brabham 2001). So why didn’t Chris become a neurosurgeon, professor, or
aeronautical engineer? According to Macolm Gladwell (2008) in his book Outliers: The Story of
Success, Chris didn’t possess the set of social skills necessary to succeed on such a high
level—skills that aren’t innate, but learned.
Gladwell looked to a recent study conducted by sociologist Annette Lareau in which she
closely shadowed 12 families from various economic backgrounds and examined their parenting
techniques. Parents from lower income families followed a strategy of “accomplishment of natural
growth,” which is to say they let their children develop on their own with a large amount of
independence; parents from higher income families, however, “actively fostered and accessed a
child’s talents, opinions, and skills” (Gladwell 2008). These parents were more likely to engage in
analytical conversation, encourage active questioning of the establishment, and foster development
of negotiation skills. The parents were also able to introduce their children to a wide range of
activities, from sports to music to accelerated academic programs. When one middle class child
was denied entry to a gifted and talented program, the mother petitioned the school and arranged
additional testing until her daughter was admitted. Lower income parents, however, were more
likely to unquestioningly obey authorities such as school boards. Their children were not being
socialized to comfortably confront the system and speak up (Gladwell 2008).
What does this have to do with Chris Langan, deemed by some as the smartest man in the
world (Brabham 2001)? Chris was born in severe poverty, moving across the country with an
abusive and alcoholic stepfather. Chris’s genius went greatly unnoticed. After accepting a full
scholarship to Reed College, his funding was revoked after his mother failed to fill out necessary
paperwork. Unable to successfully make his case to the administration, Chris, who had received
straight A’s the previous semester, was given F’s on his transcript and forced to drop out. After
enrolling in Montana State, an administrator’s refusal to rearrange his class schedule left him
unable to find the means necessary to travel the 16 miles to attend classes. What Chris had in
brilliance, he lacked practical intelligence, or what psychologist Robert Sternberg defines as
“knowing what to say to whom, knowing when to say it, and knowing how to say it for maximum
effect” (Sternberg et al. 2000). Such knowledge was never part of his socialization.
Chris gave up on school and began working an array of blue-collar jobs, pursuing his
intellectual interests on the side. Though he’s recently garnered attention from work on his
“Cognitive Theoretic Model of the Universe,” he remains weary and resistant of the educational
system.
As Gladwell concluded, “He’d had to make his way alone, and no one—not rock stars, not
professional athletes, not software billionaires, and not even geniuses—ever makes it alone”
(2008).

CHAPTER 5 | SOCIALIZATION

Sociologists all recognize the importance of socialization for healthy individual and societal
development. But how do scholars working in the three major theoretical paradigms approach this
topic? Structural functionalists would say that socialization is essential to society, both because it trains
members to operate successfully within it and because it perpetuates culture by transmitting it to new
generations. Without socialization, a society’s culture would perish as members died off. A conflict
theorist might argue that socialization reproduces inequality from generation to generation by
conveying different expectations and norms to those with different social characteristics. For example,
individuals are socialized differently by gender, social class, and race. As in the illustration of Chris
Langan, this creates different (unequal) opportunities. An interactionist studying socialization is
concerned with face-to-face exchanges and symbolic communication. For example, dressing baby boys
in blue and baby girls in pink is one small way that messages are conveyed about differences in gender
roles.

5.3 Agents of Socialization
Socialization helps people learn to function successfully in their social worlds. How does the process of
socialization occur? How do we learn to use the objects of our society’s material culture? How do we
come to adopt the beliefs, values, and norms that represent its nonmaterial culture? This learning takes
place through interaction with various agents of socialization, like peer groups and families, plus both
formal and informal social institutions.

Social Group Agents
Social groups often provide the first experiences of socialization. Families, and later peer groups,
communicate expectations and reinforce norms. People first learn to use the tangible objects of material
culture in these settings, as well as being introduced to the beliefs and values of society.
Family
Family is the first agent of socialization. Mothers and fathers, siblings and grandparents, plus members
of an extended family, all teach a child what he or she needs to know. For example, they show the child
how to use objects (such as clothes, computers, eating utensils, books, bikes); how to relate to others
(some as “family,” others as “friends,” still others as “strangers” or “teachers” or “neighbors”); and how
the world works (what is “real” and what is “imagined”). As you are aware, either from your own
experience as a child or your role in helping to raise one, socialization involves teaching and learning
about an unending array of objects and ideas.

CHAPTER 5 | SOCIALIZATION

It is important to keep in mind, however, that families do not socialize children in a vacuum. Many
social factors impact how a family raises its children. For example, we can use sociological imagination
to recognize that individual behaviors are affected by the historical period in which they take place.
Sixty years ago, it would not have been considered especially strict for a father to hit his son with a
wooden spoon or a belt if he misbehaved, but today that same action might be considered child abuse.
Sociologists recognize that race, social class, religion, and other societal factors play an important
role in socialization. For example, poor families usually emphasize obedience and conformity when
raising their children, while wealthy families emphasize judgment and creativity (National Opinion
Research Center 2008).This may be because working-class parents have less education and more
repetitive-task jobs for which the ability to follow rules and to conform helps. Wealthy parents tend to
have better educations and often work in managerial positions or in careers that require creative
problem solving, so they teach their children behaviors that would be beneficial in these positions. This
means that children are effectively socialized and raised to take the types of jobs that their parents
already have, thus reproducing the class system (Kohn 1977). Likewise, children are socialized to abide
by gender norms, perceptions of race, and class-related behaviors.
In Sweden, for instance, stay-at-home fathers are an accepted part of the social landscape. A
government policy provides subsidized time off work—480 days for families with newborns—with the
option of the paid leave being shared between both mothers and fathers. As one stay-at-home dad says,
being home to take care of his baby son “is a real fatherly thing to do. I think that’s very masculine”
(Associated Press 2011). How do America’s policies—and our society’s expected gender
roles—compare? How will Swedish children raised this way be socialized to parental gender norms?
How might that be different from parental gender norms in the United States?

Figure 5.5 The socialized roles of dads (and moms) vary by society. (Photo courtesy of Nate Grigg/flickr)
Peer Groups
A peer group is made up of people who are similar in age and social status and who share interests.
Peer group socialization begins in the earliest years, such as when kids on a playground teach younger
children the norms about taking turns or the rules of a game or how to shoot a basket. As children grow
into teenagers, this process continues. Peer groups are important to adolescents in a new way, as they
begin to develop an identity separate from their parents and exert independence. Additionally, peer
groups provide their own opportunities for socialization since kids usually engage in different types of
activities with their peers than they do with their families. Peer groups provide adolescents’ first major
socialization experience outside the realm of their families. Interestingly, studies have shown that
although friendships rank high in adolescents’ priorities, this is balanced by parental influence.

Institutional Agents
The social institutions of our culture also inform our socialization. Formal institutions—like schools,
workplaces, and the government—teach people how to behave in and navigate these systems. Other
institutions, like the media, contribute to socialization by inundating us with messages about norms and
expectations.
School
Most American children spend about seven hours a day, 180 days a year, in school, which makes it hard
to deny the importance school has on their socialization (U.S. Department of Education 2004). Students
are not only in school to study math, reading, science, and other subjects—the manifest function of this
system. Schools also serve a latent function in society by socializing children into behaviors like
teamwork, following a schedule, and using textbooks.

CHAPTER 5 | SOCIALIZATION

Figure 5.6 These kindergarteners aren’t just learning to read and write, they are being socialized to norms like keeping
their hands to themselves, standing in line, and reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. (Photo courtesy of Bonner Springs Library/
flickr)
School and classroom rituals, led by teachers serving as role models and leaders, regularly
reinforce what society expects from children. Sociologists describe this aspect of schools as the hidden
curriculum, the informal teaching done by schools.
For example, in the United States, schools have built a sense of competition into the way grades
are awarded and the way teachers evaluate students (Bowles and Gintis 1976). When children
participate in a relay race or a math contest, they learn that there are winners and losers in society.
When children are required to work together on a project, they practice teamwork with other people in
cooperative situations. The hidden curriculum prepares children for the adult world. Children learn how
to deal with bureaucracy, rules, expectations, waiting their turn, and sitting still for hours during the
day. Schools in different cultures socialize children differently in order to prepare them to function well
in those cultures. The latent functions of teamwork and dealing with bureaucracy are features of
American culture.
Schools also socialize children by teaching them about citizenship and national pride. In the
United States, children are taught to say the Pledge of Allegiance. Most districts require classes about
U.S. history and geography. As academic understanding of history evolves, textbooks in the United
States have been scrutinized and revised to update attitudes toward other cultures as well as
perspectives on historical events; thus, children are socialized to a different national or world history
than earlier textbooks may have done. For example, information about the mistreatment of African
Americans and Native American Indians more accurately reflects those events than in textbooks of the
past.

Controversial Textbooks
On August 13, 2001, 20 South Korean men gathered in Seoul. Each chopped off one of his own
fingers because of textbooks. These men took drastic measures to protest eight middle school
textbooks approved by Tokyo for use in Japanese middle schools. According to the Korean
government (and other East Asian nations), the textbooks glossed over negative events in Japan’s
history at the expense of other Asian countries.
In the early 1900s, Japan was one of Asia’s more aggressive nations. Korea was held as a
colony by the Japanese between 1910 and 1945. Today, Koreans argue that the Japanese are
whitewashing that colonial history through these textbooks. One major criticism is that they do not

CHAPTER 5 | SOCIALIZATION

mention that, during World War II, the Japanese forced Korean women into sexual slavery. The
textbooks describe the women as having been “drafted” to work, a euphemism that downplays the
brutality of what actually occurred. Some Japanese textbooks dismiss an important Korean
independence demonstration in 1919 as a “riot.” In reality, Japanese soldiers attacked peaceful
demonstrators, leaving roughly 6,000 dead and 15,000 wounded (Crampton 2002).
Although it may seem extreme that people are so enraged about how events are described in a
textbook that they would resort to dismemberment, the protest affirms that textbooks are a
significant tool of socialization in state-run education systems.
The Workplace
Just as children spend much of their day at school, many American adults at some point invest a
significant amount of time at a place of employment. Although socialized into their culture since birth,
workers require new socialization into a workplace, both in terms of material culture (such as how to
operate the copy machine) and nonmaterial culture (such as whether it’s okay to speak directly to the
boss or how the refrigerator is shared).
Different jobs require different types of socialization. In the past, many people worked a single job
until retirement. Today, the trend is to switch jobs at least once a decade. Between the ages of 18 and
44, the average baby boomer of the younger set held 11 different jobs (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
2010). This means that people must become socialized to, and socialized by, a variety of work
environments.
Religion
While some religions may tend toward being an informal institution, this section focuses on practices
related to formal institutions. Religion is an important avenue of socialization for many people. The
United States is full of synagogues, temples, churches, mosques, and similar religious communities
where people gather to worship and learn. Like other institutions, these places teach participants how to
interact with the religion’s material culture (like a mezuzah, a prayer rug, or a communion wafer). For
some people, important ceremonies related to family structure—like marriage and birth—are connected
to religious celebrations. Many of these institutions uphold gender norms and contribute to their
enforcement through socialization. From ceremonial rites of passage that reinforce the family unit, to
power dynamics which reinforce gender roles, religion fosters a shared set of socialized values that are
passed on through society.
Government
Although we do not think about it, many of the rites of passage people go through today are based on
age norms established by the government. To be defined as an “adult” usually means being 18 years
old, the age at which a person becomes legally responsible for themselves. And 65 is the start of “old
age” since most people become eligible for senior benefits at that point.
Each time we embark on one of these new categories—senior, adult, taxpayer—we must be
socialized into this new role. Seniors must learn the ropes of Medicare, Social Security benefits, and
getting a senior discount where they shop. When American males turn 18, they must register with the
Selective Service System within 30 days to be entered into a database for possible military service.
These government dictates mark the points at which we require socialization into a new category.
Mass Media
Mass media refers to the distribution of impersonal information to a wide audience, such as what
happens via television, newspapers, radio, and the Internet. With the average person spending over four
hours a day in front of the TV (and children averaging even more screen time), media greatly influences
social norms (Roberts, Foehr, and Rideout 2005). People learn about objects of material culture (like
new technology and transportation options), as well as nonmaterial culture—what is true (beliefs), what
is important (values), and what is expected (norms).

Girls and Movies

Figure 5.7 Some people are concerned about the way girls today are socialized into a “princess culture.” (Photo

Pixar is one of the largest producers of children’s movies in the world and has released large box
office draws, such as Toy Story, Cars, The Incredibles, and Up. What Pixar has never before
produced is a movie with a female lead role. This will change with Pixar’s newest movie Brave,
which is due out in 2012. Before Brave, women in Pixar served as supporting characters and love
interests. In Up, for example, the only human female character dies within the first 10 minutes of
the film. For the millions of girls watching Pixar films, there are few strong characters or roles for
them to relate to. If they do not see possible versions of themselves, they may come to view
women as secondary to the lives of men.
The animated films of Pixar’s parent company, Disney, have many female lead roles. Disney
is well known for films with female leads, such as Snow White, Cinderella, The Little Mermaid,
and Mulan. Many of Disney’s movies star a female, and she is nearly always a princess figure. If
she is not a princess to begin with, she typically ends the movie by marrying a prince or, in the
case of Mulan, a military general. Although not all “princesses” in Disney movies play a passive
role in their lives, they typically find themselves needing to be rescued by a man, and the happy
ending they all search for includes marriage.
Alongside this prevalence of princesses, many parents are expressing concern about the
culture of princesses that Disney has created. Peggy Orenstein addresses this problem in her
popular book, Cinderella Ate My Daughter. Orenstein wonders why every little girl is expected to
be a “princess” and why pink has become an all-consuming obsession for many young girls.
Another mother wondered what she did wrong when her three-year-old daughter refused to do
“non-princessy” things, including running and jumping. The effects of this princess culture can
have negative consequences for girls throughout life. An early emphasis on beauty and sexiness
can lead to eating disorders, low self-esteem, and risky sexual behavior among older girls.
What should we expect from Pixar’s new movie, the first starring a female character?
Although Brave features a female lead, she is still a princess. Will this film offer any new type of
role model for young girls? (O’Connor 2011; Barnes 2010; Rose 2011).

5.4 Socialization Across the Life Course
Socialization isn’t a one-time or even a short-term event. We aren’t “stamped” by some socialization
machine as we move along a conveyor belt and thereby socialized once and for all. In fact, socialization
is a lifelong process.
In the United States, socialization throughout the life course is determined greatly by age norms
and “time-related rules and regulations” (Setterson 2002). As we grow older, we encounter age-related
transition points that require socialization into a new role, such as becoming school age, entering the
workforce, or retiring. For example, the U.S. government mandates that all children attend school.
Child labor laws, enacted in the early 20th century, nationally declared that childhood be a time of
learning, not of labor. In countries such as Niger and Sierra Leone, however, child labor remains
common and socially acceptable, with little legislation to regulate such practices (UNICEF 2011).

Gap Year: How Different Societies Socialize
Young Adults

Figure 5.8 Age transition points require socialization into new roles that can vary widely between societies. Young
adults in America are encouraged to enter college or the workforce right away, students in England and India can take a
year off like Princes William and Harry did, while young men in Singapore and Switzerland must serve time in the military.

Have you ever heard of gap year? It’s a common custom in British society. When teens finish their
secondary schooling (aka high school in the United States), they often take a year “off” before
entering college. Frequently, they might take a job, travel, or find other ways to experience another
culture. Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, spent his gap year practicing survival skills in
Belize, teaching English in Chile, and working on a dairy farm in the United Kingdom (Prince of
Wales 2012a). His brother, Prince Harry, advocated for AIDS orphans in Africa and worked as a
jackeroo (a novice ranch hand) in Australia (Prince of Wales 2012b).
In the United States, this life transition point is socialized quite differently, and taking a year
off is generally frowned upon. Instead, American youth are encouraged to pick career paths by
their mid-teens, to select a college and a major by their late teens, and to have completed all
collegiate schooling or technical training for their career by their early 20s.
In yet other nations, this phase of the life course is tied into conscription, a term that describes
compulsory military service. Egypt, Switzerland, Turkey, and Singapore all have this system in
place. Youth in these nations (often only the males) are expected to undergo a number of months
or years of military training and service.
How might your life be different if you lived in one of these other countries? Can you think
of similar social norms—related to life age-transition points—that vary from country to country?
Many of life’s social expectations are made clear and enforced on a cultural level. Through
interacting with others and watching others interact, the expectation to fulfill roles becomes clear.
While in elementary or middle school, the prospect of having a boyfriend or girlfriend may have been
considered undesirable. The socialization that takes place in high school changes the expectation. By
observing the excitement and importance attached to dating and relationships within the high school
social scene, it quickly becomes apparent that one is now expected not only to be a child and a student,
but a significant other as well. Graduation from formal education—high school, vocational school, or
college—involves socialization into a new set of expectations.
Educational expectations vary not only from culture to culture, but from class to class. While
middle or upper class families may expect their daughter or son to attend a four-year university after
graduating from high school, other families may expect their child to immediately begin working fulltime, as many within their family have done before.

Real World

The Long Road to Adulthood for Millennials
2008 was a year of financial upheaval in the United States. Rampant foreclosures and bank failures
set off a chain of events sparking government distrust, loan defaults, and large-scale
unemployment. How has this affected America’s young adults?
Millennials, sometimes also called Gen Y, is a term that describes the generation born during
the early eighties to early nineties. While the recession was in full swing, many were in the process
of entering, attending, or graduating from high school and college. With employment prospects at
historical lows, large numbers of graduates were unable to find work, sometimes moving back in
with their parents and struggling to pay back student loans.
According to the New York Times, this economic stall is causing the Millennials to postpone
what most Americans consider to be adulthood: “The traditional cycle seems to have gone off
course, as young people remain untethered to romantic partners or to permanent homes, going
back to school for lack of better options, traveling, avoiding commitments, competing ferociously
for unpaid internships or temporary (and often grueling) Teach for America jobs, forestalling the
beginning of adult life” (Henig 2010).
The five milestones, Henig writes, that define adulthood, are “completing school, leaving
home, becoming financially independent, marrying, and having a child” (Henig 2010). These
social milestones are taking longer for Millennials to attain, if they’re attained at all. Sociologists
wonder what long-term impact this generation’s situation may have on society as a whole.
In the process of socialization, adulthood brings a new set of challenges and expectations, as well
as new roles to fill. As the aging process moves forward, social roles continue to evolve. Pleasures of
youth, such as wild nights out and serial dating, become less acceptable in the eyes of society.
Responsibility and commitment are emphasized as pillars of adulthood, and men and women are
expected to “settle down.” During this period, many people enter into marriage or a civil union, bring
children into their families, and focus on a career path. They become partners or parents instead of
students or significant others.
Just as young children pretend to be doctors or lawyers, play house, and dress up, adults also
engage anticipatory socialization, the preparation for future life roles. Examples would include a
couple who cohabitate before marriage, or soon-to-be parents who read infant care books and prepare
their home for the new arrival. As part of anticipatory socialization, adults who are financially able
begin planning for their retirement, saving money and looking into future health care options. The
transition into any new life role, despite the social structure that supports it, can be difficult.

Resocialization
In the process of resocialization, old behaviors that were helpful in a previous role are removed
because they are no longer of use. Resocialization is necessary when a person moves to a senior care
center, goes to boarding school, or serves time in jail. In the new environment, the old rules no longer
apply. The process of resocialization is typically more stressful than normal socialization because
people have to unlearn behaviors that have become customary to them.
The most common way resocialization occurs is in a total institution where people are isolated
from society and are forced to follow someone else’s rules. A ship at sea is a total institution, as are
religious convents, prisons, or some cult organizations. They are places cut off from a larger society.
The 7.1 million Americans who lived in prisons or penitentiaries at the end of 2010 are also members of
this type of institution (U.S. Department of Justice 2011). As another example, every branch of the
military is a total institution.
Many individuals are resocialized into an institution through a two-part process. First, members
entering an institution must leave behind their old identity through what is known as a degradation
ceremony. In a degradation ceremony, new members lose the aspects of their old identity and are
given new identities. The process is sometimes gentle. To enter a senior care home, an elderly person
often must leave a family home and give up many belongings which were part of his or her long-

CHAPTER 5 | SOCIALIZATION

standing identity. Though caretakers guide the elderly compassionately, the process can still be one of
loss. In many cults, this process is also gentle and happens in an environment of support and caring.
In other situations, the degradation ceremony can be more extreme. New prisoners lose freedom,
rights (including the right to privacy), and personal belongings. When entering the army, soldiers have
their hair cut short. Their old clothes are removed and they wear matching uniforms. These individuals
must give up any markers of their former identity in order to be resocialized into an identity as a
“soldier.”

Figure 5.9 In basic training, members of the Air Force are taught to walk, move, and look like each other. (Photo courtesy
of Staff Sergeant Desiree N. Palacios, U.S. Air Force/Wikimedia Commons)
After new members of an institution are stripped of their old identity, they build a new one that
matches the new society. In the military, soldiers go through basic training together, where they learn
new rules and bond with one another. They follow structured schedules set by their leaders. Soldiers
must keep their areas clean for inspection, learn to march in correct formations, and salute when in the
presence of superiors.
Learning to deal with life after having lived in a total institution requires yet another process of
resocialization. In the U.S. military, soldiers learn discipline and a capacity for hard work. They set
aside personal goals to achieve a mission, and they take pride in the accomplishments of their units.
Many soldiers who leave the military transition these skills into excellent careers. Others find
themselves lost upon leaving, uncertain about the outside world, and what to do next. The process of
resocialization to civilian life is not a simple one.

Section Summary
5.1 Theories of Self Development
Psychological theories of self development have been broadened by sociologists who explicitly study
the role of society and social interaction in self development. Charles Cooley and George Mead both
contributed significantly to the sociological understanding of the development of self. Lawrence
Kohlberg and Carol Gilligan developed their ideas further, researching how our sense of morality
develops. Gilligan added the dimension of gender differences to Kohlberg’s theory.

5.2 Why Socialization Matters
Socialization is important because it helps uphold societies and cultures; it is also a key part of
individual development. Research demonstrates that who we are is affected by both nature (our genetic
and hormonal makeup) and nurture (the social environment in which we are raised). Sociology is most
concerned with the way that society’s influence affects our behavior patterns, made clear by the way
behavior varies across class and gender.

5.3 Agents of Socialization
Our direct interactions with social groups, like families and peers, teach us how others expect us to
behave. Likewise, a society’s formal and informal institutions socialize its population. Schools,
workplaces, and the media communicate and reinforce cultural norms and values.

5.4 Socialization Across the Life Course
Socialization is a lifelong process recurring as we enter new phases of life, such as adulthood or senior
age. Resocialization is a process that removes the socialization we have developed over time and
replaces it with newly learned rules and roles. Because it involves removing old habits that have been
built up, resocialization can be a stressful and difficult process.

Short Answer
5.1 Theories of Self Development
1. Think of a current issue or pattern that a sociologist might study. What types of questions would the
sociologist ask, and what research methods might he employ? Now consider the questions and methods
a psychologist might use to study the same issue. Comment on their different approaches.
2. Explain why it’s important to conduct research using both male and female participants. What
sociological topics might show gender differences? Provide some examples to illustrate your ideas.

5.2 Why Socialization Matters
3. Why are twin studies an important way to learn about the relative effects of genetics and
socialization on children? What questions about human development do you believe twin studies are
best for answering? For what types of questions would twin studies not be as helpful?
4. Why do you think that people like Chris Langan continue to have difficulty even after they are
helped through societal systems? What is it they’ve missed that prevents them from functioning
successfully in the social world?

5.3 Agents of Socialization
5. Do you think it is important that parents discuss gender roles with their young children, or is gender
a topic better left for later? How do parents consider gender norms when buying their children books,
movies, and toys? How do you believe they should consider it?
6. Based on your observations, when are adolescents more likely to listen to their parents or to their
peer groups when making decisions? What types of dilemmas lend themselves toward one social agent
over another?

5.4 Socialization Across the Life Course
7. Consider a person who is joining a sorority or fraternity, or attending college or boarding school, or
even a child beginning kindergarten. How is the process the student goes through a form of
socialization? What new cultural behaviors must the student adapt to?
8. Do you think resocialization requires a total institution? Why or why not? Can you think of any other
ways someone could be resocialized?

Introduction Groups and Organizations
The alternative punk band NOFX is playing outside in Los Angeles. The music is loud, the crowd
pumped up and excited. But neither the lyrics nor the people in the audience are quite what you might
expect. Mixed in with the punks and young rebel students are members of local unions, from welldressed teachers to more grizzled labor leaders. The lyrics are not published anywhere but are available

CHAPTER 6 | GROUPS AND ORGANIZATION

on YouTube: “We’re here to represent/The 99 percent/Occupy, occupy, occupy.” The song: “Wouldn’t It
Be Nice If Every Movement Had a Theme Song” (Cabrel 2011).
Across the country at an Occupy camp in New York, roughly three dozen members of the
Facilitation Working Group, a part of the General Assembly, take a steady stream of visitors with
requests at their unofficial headquarters. One person wants a grant for $1500 to make herbal
medications available to those staying at the park. Another wants to present Native American peace
principles derived from the Iroquois Confederacy. Yet another has a spreadsheet that he wants used as
an evaluation tool for the facilitators. Numerous groups make up this movement, yet there’s no national
leader. What makes a group something more than just a collection of people? How are leadership
functions and styles established in a group dynamic?
Most people have a sense of what it means to be a part of some kind of a group, whether it is a
sports team, sorority, school club, or family. Groups connect us to others through commonalities of
geography, interests, race, religion, and activities. But for the groups of people protesting from Augusta,
Georgia, to Oakland, California, and hundreds of cities in between, their connection within the Occupy
Wall Street movement is harder to define. What unites these people? Are the out-of-work doctoral
candidates truly aligned with the high school dropouts? Do the urban poor genuinely feel for the
campus-based protest against university tuition hikes?
Groups are prevalent in our social lives and provide a significant way we understand and define
ourselves—both through groups we feel a connection to and those we don’t. Groups also play an
important role in society. As enduring social units, they help foster shared value systems and are key to
the structure of society as we know it. There are three primary sociological perspectives for studying
groups: Functionalist, Conflict, and Interactionist. We can look at the Occupy movement through the
lenses of these methods to better understand the roles and challenges that groups offer.
The Functionalist perspective is a big-picture macro-level view that looks at how different aspects
of society are intertwined. This perspective is based on the idea that society is a well-balanced system
with all parts necessary to the whole, and it studies the roles these parts play in relation to the whole. In
the case of the Occupy Movement, a Functionalist might look at what macro-level needs the movement
serves. For example, a Structural Functionalist might ask how the Occupy Wall Street movement forces
both haves and have-nots to pay attention to the economy, or the way urbanites are impacted by the
influx of protestors who typically reside outside of their region.
The Conflict perspective is another macroanalytical view, one that focuses on the genesis and
growth of inequality. A conflict theorist studying the Occupy movement might look at how business
interests have manipulated the system over the last 30 years, leading to the gross inequality we see
today. Or this perspective might explore how the massive redistribution of wealth from the middle class
to the upper class could lead to a two-class system reminiscent of Marxist ideas.
A third perspective is the Symbolic Interaction or Interactionist perspective. This method of
analyzing groups takes a micro-level view. Instead of studying the big picture, these researchers look at
the day-to-day interactions of groups. Studying these details, the Interactionist looks at issues like
leadership style and group dynamics. In the case of the Occupy Movement, Interactionists might ask,
“How does the group dynamic in New York differ from that in Atlanta?” Or, “What dictates who
becomes the de facto leader in different cities—geography, social dynamics, economic circumstances?”

6.1 Types of Groups
Most of us feel comfortable using the word “group” without giving it much thought. In everyday use, it
can be a generic term, although it carries important clinical and scientific meanings. Moreover, the
concept of a group is central to much of how we think about society and human interaction. Often, we
might mean different things by using that word. We might say that a group of kids all saw the dog, and
it could mean 250 students in a lecture hall or four siblings playing on a front lawn. In everyday
conversation, there isn’t a clear distinguishing use. So how can we hone the meaning more precisely for
sociological purposes?

Defining a Group
The term group is an amorphous one and can refer to a wide variety of gatherings, from just two people
(think about a “group project” in school when you partner with another student), a club, a regular
gathering of friends, or people who work together or share a hobby. In short, the term refers to any
collection of at least two people who interact with some frequency and who share a sense that their
identity is somehow aligned with the group. Of course, every time people are gathered it is not
necessarily a group. A rally is usually a one-time event, for instance, and belonging to a political party

CHAPTER 6 | GROUPS AND ORGANIZATION

doesn’t imply interaction with others. People who exist in the same place at the same time, but who do
not interact or share a sense of identity—such as a bunch of people standing in line at Starbucks—are
considered an aggregate, or a crowd. Another example of a non-group is people who share similar
characteristics but are not tied to one another in any way. These people would be considered a
category, and an example would be that all children born from approximately 1980–2000 are referred
to as “Millennial.” Why are Millennials a category and not a group? Because while some of them may
share a sense of identity, they do not, as a whole, interact frequently with each other.
Interestingly, people within an aggregate or category can become a group. During disasters, people
in a neighborhood (an aggregate) who did not know each other might become friendly and depend on
each other at the local shelter. After the disaster ends and the people go back to simply living near each
other, the feeling of cohesiveness may last since they have all shared an experience. They might remain
a group, practicing emergency readiness, coordinating supplies for next time, or taking turns caring for
neighbors who need extra help. Similarly, there may be many groups within a single category. Consider
teachers, for example. Within this category, groups may exist like teachers’ unions, teachers who coach,
or staff members who are involved with the PTA.

Types of Groups
Sociologist Charles Horton Cooley (1864–1929) suggested that groups can broadly be divided into two
categories: primary groups and secondary groups (Cooley 1909). According to Cooley, primary
groups play the most critical role in our lives. The primary group is usually fairly small and is made up
of individuals who generally engage face-to-face in long-term emotional ways. This group serves
emotional needs: expressive functions rather than pragmatic ones. The primary group is usually made
up of significant others, those individuals who have the most impact on our socialization. The best
example of a primary group is the family.
Secondary groups are often larger and impersonal. They may also be task-focused and timelimited. These groups serve an instrumental function rather than an expressive one, meaning that their
role is more goal- or task-oriented than emotional. A classroom or office can be an example of a
secondary group. Neither primary nor secondary groups are bound by strict definitions or set limits. In
fact, people can move from one group to another. A graduate seminar, for example, can start as a
secondary group focused on the class at hand, but as the students work together throughout their
program, they may find common interests and strong ties that transform them into a primary group.

Careers in Sociology

Best Friends She’s Never Met
Writer Allison Levy worked alone. While she liked the freedom and flexibility of working from
home, she sometimes missed having a community of coworkers, both for the practical purpose of
brainstorming and the more social “water cooler” aspect. Levy did what many do in the internet
age: she found a group of other writers online through a web forum. Over time, a group of
approximately 20 writers, who all wrote for a similar audience, broke off from the larger forum
and started a private invitation-only forum. While writers in general represent all genders, ages,
and interests, it ended up being a collection of 20- and 30-something women who comprised the
new forum; they all wrote fiction for children and young adults.
At first, the writers’ forum was clearly a secondary group united by the members’ professions
and work situations. As Levy explained, “On the internet, you can be present or absent as often as
you want. No one is expecting you to show up.” It was a useful place to research information
about different publishers and about who had recently sold what, and to track industry trends. But
as time passed, Levy found it served a different purpose. Since the group shared other
characteristics beyond their writing (such as age and gender), the online conversation naturally
turned to matters such as child-rearing, aging parents, health, and exercise. Levy found it was a
sympathetic place to talk about any number of subjects, not just writing. Further, when people
didn’t post for several days, others expressed concern, asking whether anyone had heard from the
missing writers. It reached a point where most members would tell the group if they were traveling
or needed to be offline for awhile.

CHAPTER 6 | GROUPS AND ORGANIZATION

The group continued to share. One member on the site who was going through a difficult
family illness wrote, “I don’t know where I’d be without you women. It is so great to have a place
to vent that I know isn’t hurting anyone.” Others shared similar sentiments.
So is this a primary group? Most of these people have never met each other. They live in
Hawaii, Australia, Minnesota, and across the world. They may never meet. Levy wrote recently to
the group, saying, “Most of my ‘real-life’ friends and even my husband don’t really get the writing
thing. I don’t know what I’d do without you.” Despite the distance and the lack of physical
contact, the group clearly fills an expressive need.

and out-groups? (Photo courtesy of USACEpublicaffairs/flickr)

In-Groups and Out-Groups
One of the ways that groups can be powerful is through inclusion, and its inverse, exclusion. In-groups
and out-groups are subcategories of primary and secondary groups that help identify this dynamic.
Primary groups consist of both in-groups and out-groups, as do secondary groups. The feeling that one
belongs in an elite or select group is a heady one, while the feeling of not being allowed in, or of being
in competition with a group, can be motivating in a different way. Sociologist William Sumner
(1840–1910) developed the concepts of in-group and out-group to explain this phenomenon (Sumner
1906). In short, an in-group is the group that an individual feels she belongs to, and she believes it to be
an integral part of who she is. An out-group, conversely, is a group someone doesn’t belong to; often
there may be a feeling of disdain or competition in relation to an out-group. Sports teams, unions, and
sororities are examples of in-groups and out-groups; people may belong to, or be an outsider to, any of
these.
While these affiliations can be neutral or even positive, such as the case of a team sport
competition, the concept of in-groups and out-groups can also explain some negative human behavior,
such as white supremacist movements like the Ku Klux Klan, or the bullying of gay or lesbian students.
By defining others as “not like us” and inferior, in-groups can end up practicing ethnocentrism, racism,
sexism, ageism, and heterosexism—manners of judging others negatively based on their culture, race,
sex, age, or sexuality. Often, in-groups can form within a secondary group. For instance, a workplace
can have cliques of people, from senior executives who play golf together, to engineers who write code
together, to young singles who socialize after hours. While these in-groups might show favoritism and
affinity for other in-group members, the overall organization may be unable or unwilling to
acknowledge it. Therefore, it pays to be wary of the politics of in-groups, since members may exclude
others as a form of gaining status within the group.

Bullying and Cyberbullying: How Technology
Has Changed the Game
Most of us know that the old rhyme “sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never
hurt me” is inaccurate. Words can hurt, and never is that more apparent than in instances of
bullying. Bullying has always existed, often reaching extreme levels of cruelty in children and
young adults. People at these stages of life are especially vulnerable to others’ opinions of them,
and they’re deeply invested in their peer groups. Today, technology has ushered in a new era of
this dynamic. Cyberbullying is the use of interactive media by one person to torment another, and
it is on the rise. Cyberbullying can mean sending threatening texts, harassing someone in a public
forum (such as Facebook), hacking someone’s account and pretending to be him or her, posting
embarrassing images online, and so on. A study by the Cyberbullying Research Center found that
20 percent of middle school students admitted to “seriously thinking about committing suicide” as
a result of online bullying (Hinduja and Patchin 2010). Whereas bullying face-to-face requires
willingness to interact with your victim, cyberbullying allows bullies to harass others from the
privacy of their homes without witnessing the damage firsthand. This form of bullying is
particularly dangerous because it’s widely accessible and therefore easier to accomplish.
Cyberbullying, and bullying in general, made international headlines in 2010 when a 15-yearold girl, Phoebe Prince, in South Hadley, Massachusetts, committed suicide after being relentlessly
bullied by girls at her school. In the aftermath of her death, the bullies were prosecuted in the legal
system and the state passed anti-bullying legislation. This marked a significant change in how
bullying, including cyberbullying, is viewed in the United States. Now there are numerous
resources for schools, families, and communities to provide education and prevention on this issue.
The White House hosted a Bullying Prevention summit in March 2011, and President and First
Lady Obama have used Facebook and other social media sites to discuss the importance of the
issue.
Will it change the behavior of would-be cyberbullies? That remains to be seen. But hopefully
communities can work to protect victims before they feel they must resort to extreme measures.

Reference Groups

A reference group is a group that people compare themselves to—it provides a standard of
measurement. In American society, peer groups are common reference groups. Kids and adults pay
attention to what their peers wear, what music they like, what they do with their free time—and they
compare themselves to what they see. Most people have more than one reference group, so a middle
school boy might not just look at his classmates but also at his older brother’s friends and see a different
set of norms. And he might observe the antics of his favorite athletes for yet another set of behaviors.

CHAPTER 6 | GROUPS AND ORGANIZATION

Some other examples of reference groups can be an individual’s church, synagogue, or mosque;
one’s cultural center; workplace; family gathering; and even one’s parents. Often, reference groups
convey competing messages. For instance, on television and in movies, young adults often have
wonderful apartments, cars, and lively social lives despite not holding a job. In music videos, young
women might dance and sing in a sexually aggressive way that suggests experience beyond their years.
At all ages, we use reference groups to help guide our behavior and show us social norms. So how
important is it to surround yourself with positive reference groups? You may never meet or know a
reference group, but it still impacts and influences how you act. Identifying reference groups can help
you understand the source of the social identities you aspire to or want to distance yourself from.

For a student entering college, the sociological study of groups takes on an immediate and
practical meaning. After all, when we arrive someplace new, most of us glance around to see how
well we fit in or stand out in the ways we want. This is a natural response to a reference group, and
on a large campus, there can be many competing groups. Say you are a strong athlete who wants to
play intramural sports, but your favorite musicians are a local punk band. You may find yourself
engaged with two very different reference groups.
These reference groups can also become your in-groups or out-groups. For instance, different
groups on campus might solicit you to join. Are there fraternities and sororities at your school? If
so, chances are they will try to convince students—that is, students they deem worthy—to join
them. And if you love playing soccer and want to play on a campus team, but you’re wearing
shredded jeans, combat boots, and a local band T-shirt, you might have a hard time convincing the
soccer team to give you a chance. While most campus groups refrain from insulting competing
groups, there is a definite sense of an in-group versus an out-group. “Them?” a member might say.
“They’re all right, but their parties are nowhere near as cool as ours.” Or, “Only serious
engineering geeks join that group.” This immediate categorization into in-groups and out-groups
means that students must choose carefully, since whatever group they associate with won’t just
define their friends—it may also define their enemies.

6.2 Group Size and Structure

Dyads, Triads, and Large Groups
A small group is typically one where the collection of people is small enough that all members of the
group know each other and share simultaneous interaction, such as a nuclear family, a dyad, or a triad.
Georg Simmel (1858–1915) wrote extensively about the difference between a dyad, or two-member
group, and a triad, which is a three-member group (Simmel 1902). In the former, if one person
withdraws, the group can no longer exist. One can think of a divorce, which effectively ends the
“group” of the married couple, or of two best friends never speaking again. In a triad, however, the
dynamic is quite different. If one person withdraws, the group lives on. A triad has a different set of
relationships. If there are three in the group, two-against-one dynamics can develop and there exists the
potential for a majority opinion on any issue. Small groups generally have strong internal cohesiveness
and a sense of connection. The challenge, however, is for small groups to achieve large goals. They can
struggle to be heard or to be a force for change if they are pushing against larger groups. In short, they
are easier to ignore.
It is difficult to define exactly when a small group becomes a large group. One step might be when
there are too many people to join in a simultaneous discussion. Another might be when a group joins
with other groups as part of a movement that unites them. These larger groups may share a geographic
space, such as a fraternity or sorority on the same campus, or they might be spread out around the
globe. The larger the group, the more attention it can garner, and the more pressure members can put
toward whatever goal they wish to achieve. At the same time, the larger the group becomes, the more
the risk grows for division and lack of cohesion.

Group Leadership
Often, larger groups require some kind of leadership. In small, primary groups, leadership tends to be
informal. After all, most families don’t take a vote on who will rule the group, nor do most groups of
friends. This is not to say that de facto leaders don’t emerge, but formal leadership is rare. In secondary
groups, leadership is usually more overt. There are often clearly outlined roles and responsibilities, with
a chain of command to follow. Some secondary groups, like the army, have highly structured and
clearly understood chains of command, and many lives depend on those. After all, how well could
soldiers function in a battle if they had no idea whom to listen to or if different people were calling out
orders? Other secondary groups, like a workplace or a classroom, also have formal leaders, but the
styles and functions of leadership can vary significantly.
Leadership function refers to the main focus or goal of the leader. An instrumental leader is one
who is goal-oriented and largely concerned with accomplishing set tasks. One can imagine that an army
general or a Fortune 500 CEO would be an instrumental leader. In contrast, expressive leaders are
more concerned with promoting emotional strength and health, and ensuring that people feel supported.
Social and religious leaders—rabbis, priests, imams, directors of youth homes and social service
programs—are often perceived as expressive leaders. There is a longstanding stereotype that men are
more instrumental leaders and women are more expressive leaders. And although gender roles have
changed, even today many women and men who exhibit the opposite-gender manner can be seen as
deviants and can encounter resistance. Secretary of State and former presidential candidate Hillary
Clinton provides an example of how society reacts to a high-profile woman who is an instrumental

127

128

CHAPTER 6 | GROUPS AND ORGANIZATION

leader. Despite the stereotype, Boatwright and Forrest (2000) have found that both men and women
prefer leaders who use a combination of expressive and instrumental leadership.
In addition to these leadership functions, there are three different leadership styles. Democratic
leaders encourage group participation in all decision making. These leaders work hard to build
consensus before choosing a course of action and moving forward. This type of leader is particularly
common, for example, in a club where the members vote on which activities or projects to pursue.
These leaders can be well liked, but there is often a challenge that the work will proceed slowly since
consensus building is time-consuming. A further risk is that group members might pick sides and
entrench themselves into opposing factions rather than reaching a solution. In contrast, a laissez-faire
leader (French for “leave it alone”) is hands-off, allowing group members to self-manage and make
their own decisions. An example of this kind of leader might be an art teacher who opens the art
cupboard, leaves materials on the shelves, and tells students to help themselves and make some art.
While this style can work well with highly motivated and mature participants who have clear goals and
guidelines, it risks group dissolution and a lack of progress. As the name suggests, authoritarian
leaders issue orders and assigns tasks. These leaders are clear instrumental leaders with a strong focus
on meeting goals. Often, entrepreneurs fall into this mold, like Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.
Not surprisingly, this type of leader risks alienating the workers. There are times, however, when this
style of leadership can be required. In different circumstances, each of these leadership styles can be
effective and successful. Consider what leadership style you prefer. Why? Do you like the same style in
different areas of your life, such as a classroom, a workplace, and a sports team?

Women Leaders and the Hillary Clinton/Sarah
Palin Phenomenon

Figure 6.6 Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton drew fire for her leadership style. (Photo courtesy marcn/flickr)
The 2008 presidential election marked a dynamic change when two female politicians entered the
race. Of the 200 people who have run for president during the country’s history, fewer than 30
have been women. Democratic presidential candidate and former First Lady Hillary Clinton was
both famously polarizing and popular. She had almost as many passionate supporters as she did
people who reviled her.
On the other side of the aisle was Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin. The
former governor of Alaska, Palin was, to some, the perfect example of the modern woman. She
juggled her political career with raising a growing family, and relied heavily on the use of social
media to spread her message.
So what light did these candidates’ campaigns shed on the possibilities of a female
presidency? According to some political analysts, women candidates face a paradox: They must be
as tough as their male opponents on issues such as foreign policy or risk appearing weak.
However, the stereotypical expectation of women as expressive leaders is still prevalent. Consider
that Hillary Clinton’s popularity surged in her 2008 campaign after she cried on the campaign trail.
It was enough for the New York Times to publish an editorial, “Can Hillary Cry Her Way Back to
the White House?” (Dowd 2008). Harsh, but her approval ratings soared afterwards. In fact, many

CHAPTER 6 | GROUPS AND ORGANIZATION

compared it to how politically likable she was in the aftermath of President Clinton’s Monica
Lewinsky scandal. Sarah Palin’s expressive qualities were promoted to a greater degree. While she
has benefited from the efforts of feminists before her, she self-identified as a traditional woman
with traditional values, a point she illustrated by frequently bringing her young children up on
stage with her.
So what does this mean for women who would be president, and for those who would vote
for them? On the positive side, a recent study of 18- to 25-year-old women that asked whether
female candidates in the 2008 election made them believe a woman would be president during
their lifetime found that the majority thought they would (Weeks 2011). And the more that young
women demand female candidates, the more commonplace female contenders will become.
Women as presidential candidates may no longer be a novelty with the focus of their campaign, no
matter how obliquely, on their gender. Some, however, remain skeptical. As one political analyst
said bluntly, “women don’t succeed in politics––or other professions––unless they act like men.
The standard for running for national office remains distinctly male” (Weeks 2011).

Figure 6.7 This gag gift demonstrates how female leaders may be viewed if they violate social norms. (Photo courtesy of

Conformity
We all like to fit in to some degree. Likewise, when we want to stand out, we want to choose how we
stand out and for what reasons. For example, a woman who loves cutting-edge fashion and wants to
dress in thought-provoking new styles likely wants to be noticed, but most likely she will want to be
noticed within a framework of high fashion. She wouldn’t want people to think she was too poor to find
proper clothes. Conformity is the extent to which an individual complies with group norms or
expectations. As you might recall, we use reference groups to assess and understand how to act, to
dress, and to behave. Not surprisingly, young people are particularly aware of who conforms and who
does not. A high school boy whose mother makes him wear ironed button-down shirts might protest
that he will look stupid––that everyone else wears T-shirts. Another high school boy might like wearing
those shirts as a way of standing out. How much do you enjoy being noticed? Do you consciously
prefer to conform to group norms so as not to be singled out? Are there people in your class who
immediately come to mind when you think about those who don’t want to conform?
Psychologist Solomon Asch (1907–1996) conducted experiments that illustrated how great the
pressure to conform is, specifically within a small group (1956). After reading the feature, ask yourself
what you would do in Asch’s experiment. Would you speak up? What would help you speak up and
what would discourage it?

Sociological Research

Conforming to Expectations
In 1951, psychologist Solomon Asch sat a small group of about eight people around a table. Only
one of the people sitting there was the true subject; the rest were associates of the experimenter.
However, the subject was led to believe that the others were all, like him, people brought in for an
experiment in visual judgments. The group was shown two cards, the first card with a single
vertical line, and the second card with three vertical lines differing in length. The experimenter
polled the group, asking each participant one at a time which line on the second card matched up
with the line on the first card.
However, this was not really a test of visual judgment. Rather, it was Asch’s study on the
pressures of conformity. He was curious to see what the effect of multiple wrong answers would
be on the subject, who presumably was able to tell which lines matched. In order to test this, Asch
had each planted respondent answer in a specific way. The subject was seated in such a way that
he had to hear almost everyone else’s answers before it was his turn. Sometimes the non-subject
members would unanimously choose an answer that was clearly wrong.
So what was the conclusion? Asch found that 37 out of 50 test subjects responded with an
“obviously erroneous” answer at least once. When faced by a unanimous wrong answer from the
rest of the group, the subject conformed to a mean of four of the staged answers. Asch revised the
study and repeated it, wherein the subject still heard the staged wrong answers, but was allowed to
write down his answer rather than speak it aloud. In this version, the number of examples of
conformity––giving an incorrect answer so as not to contradict the group––fell by two thirds. He
also found that group size had an impact on how much pressure the subject felt to conform.
The results showed that speaking up when only one other person gave an erroneous answer
was far more common than when five or six people defended the incorrect position. Finally, Asch
discovered that people were far more likely to give the correct answer in the face of nearunanimous consent if they had a single ally. If even one person in the group also dissented, the
subject conformed only a quarter as often. Clearly, it was easier to be a minority of two than a
minority of one.
Asch concluded that there are two main causes for conformity: people want to be liked by the
group or they believe the group is better informed than they are. He found his study results
disturbing. To him, they revealed that intelligent, well-educated people would, with very little
coaxing, go along with an untruth. He believed this result highlighted real problems with the
education system and values in our society (Asch 1956).

6.3 Formal Organizations
A complaint of modern life is that society is dominated by large and impersonal secondary
organizations. From schools to businesses to healthcare to government, these organizations, referred to
as formal organizations, are highly bureaucratized. Indeed, all formal organizations are, or likely will
become, bureaucracies. A bureaucracy is an ideal type of formal organization. Ideal doesn’t mean
“best” in its sociological usage; it refers to a general model that describes a collection of characteristics,
or a type that could describe most examples of the item under discussion. For example, if your
professor were to tell the class to picture a car in their minds, most students will picture a car that shares
a set of characteristics: four wheels, a windshield, and so on. Everyone’s car will be somewhat
different, however. Some might picture a two-door sports car while others picture an SUV. The general
idea of the car that everyone shares is the ideal type. We will discuss bureaucracies as an ideal type of
organization.

Types of Formal Organizations

Sociologist Amitai Etzioni (1975) posited that formal organizations fall into three categories.
Normative organizations, also called voluntary organizations, are based on shared interests. As the
name suggests, joining them is voluntary and typically done because people find membership
rewarding in an intangible way. The Audubon Society or a ski club are examples of normative
organizations. Coercive organizations are groups that one must be coerced, or pushed, to join. These
may include prison or a rehabilitation center. Goffman states that most coercive organizations are total
institutions (1961). A total institution refers to one in which inmates live a controlled lifestyle and in
which total resocialization takes place. The third type is utilitarian organizations, which, as the name
suggests, are joined because of the need for a specific material reward. High school or a workplace
would fall into this category—one joined in pursuit of a diploma, the other in order to make money.

Bureaucracies
Bureaucracies are an ideal type of formal organization. Pioneer sociologist Max Weber popularly
characterized a bureaucracy as having a hierarchy of authority, a clear division of labor, explicit rules,
and impersonality (1922). People often complain about bureaucracies––declaring them slow, rulebound, difficult to navigate, and unfriendly. Let’s take a look at terms that define a bureaucracy to
understand what they mean.
Hierarchy of authority refers to the aspect of bureaucracy that places one individual or office in
charge of another, who in turn must answer to her own superiors. For example, as an employee at
Walmart, your shift manager assigns you tasks. Your shift manager answers to his store manager, who
must answer to her regional manager, and so on in a chain of command, up to the CEO who must
answer to the board members, who in turn answer to the stockholders. Everyone in this bureaucracy
follows the chain of command.
A clear division of labor refers to the fact that within a bureaucracy, each individual has a
specialized task to perform. For example, psychology professors teach psychology, but they do not
attempt to provide students with financial aid forms. In this case, it is a clear and commonsense
division. But what about in a restaurant where food is backed up in the kitchen and a hostess is standing
nearby texting on her phone? Her job is to seat customers, not to deliver food. Is this a smart division of
labor?
The existence of explicit rules refers to the way in which rules are outlined, written down, and
standardized. For example, at your college or university, the student guidelines are contained within the
Student Handbook. As technology changes and campuses encounter new concerns like cyberbullying,

131

132

CHAPTER 6 | GROUPS AND ORGANIZATION

identity theft, and other hot-button issues, organizations are scrambling to ensure their explicit rules
cover these emerging topics.
Finally, bureaucracies are also characterized by impersonality, which takes personal feelings out
of professional situations. This characteristic grew, to some extent, out of a desire to protect
organizations from nepotism, backroom deals, and other types of favoritism, simultaneously protecting
customers and others served by the organization. Impersonality is an attempt by large formal
organizations to protect their members. However, the result is often that personal experience is
disregarded. For example, you may be late for work because your car broke down, but the manager at
Pizza Hut doesn’t care about why you are late, only that you are late.
Bureaucracies are, in theory at least, meritocracies, meaning that hiring and promotion is based on
proven and documented skills, rather than on nepotism or random choice. In order to get into a
prestigious college, you need to perform well on the SAT and have an impressive transcript. In order to
become a lawyer and represent clients, you must graduate law school and pass the state bar exam. Of
course, there are many well-documented examples of success by those who did not proceed through
traditional meritocracies. Think about technology companies with founders who dropped out of college,
or performers who became famous after a YouTube video went viral. How well do you think
established meritocracies identify talent? Wealthy families hire tutors, interview coaches, test-prep
services, and consultants to help their kids get into the best schools. This starts as early as kindergarten
in New York City, where competition for the most highly-regarded schools is especially fierce. Are
these schools, many of which have copious scholarship funds that are intended to make the school more
democratic, really offering all applicants a fair shake?
There are several positive aspects of bureaucracies. They are intended to improve efficiency,
ensure equal opportunities, and increase efficiency. And there are times when rigid hierarchies are
needed. But remember that many of our bureaucracies grew large at the same time that our school
model was developed––during the Industrial Revolution. Young workers were trained and organizations
were built for mass production, assembly line work, and factory jobs. In these scenarios, a clear chain
of command was critical. Now, in the information age, this kind of rigid training and adherence to
protocol can actually decrease both productivity and efficiency.
Today’s workplace requires a faster pace, more problem-solving, and a flexible approach to work.
Too much adherence to explicit rules and a division of labor can leave an organization behind. And
unfortunately, once established, bureaucracies can take on a life of their own. Maybe you have heard
the expression “trying to turn a tanker around mid-ocean,” which refers to the difficulties of changing
direction with something large and set in its ways. State governments and current budget crises are
examples of this challenge. It is almost impossible to make quick changes, leading states to continue,
year after year, with increasingly unbalanced budgets. Finally, bureaucracies, as mentioned, grew as
institutions at a time when privileged white males held all the power. While ostensibly based on
meritocracy, bureaucracies can perpetuate the existing balance of power by only recognizing the merit
in traditionally male and privileged paths.
Michels (1911) suggested that all large organizations are characterized by the Iron Rule of
Oligarchy, wherein an entire organization is ruled by a few elites. Do you think this is true? Can a large
organization be collaborative?

Figure 6.9 This McDonald’s storefront in Egypt shows the McDonaldization of society. (Photo courtesy of s_w_ellis/flickr)

The McDonaldization of Society
The McDonaldization of Society (Ritzer 1993) refers to the increasing presence of the fast food
business model in common social institutions. This business model includes efficiency (the division of
labor), predictability, calculability, and control (monitoring). For example, in your average chain
grocery store, people at the register check out customers while stockers keep the shelves full of goods
and deli workers slice meats and cheese to order (efficiency). Whenever you enter a store within that

CHAPTER 6 | GROUPS AND ORGANIZATION

grocery chain, you receive the same type of goods, see the same store organization, and find the same
brands at the same prices (predictability). You will find that goods are sold by the pound, so that you
can weigh your fruit and vegetable purchase rather than simply guessing at the price for that bag of
onions, while the employees use a timecard to calculate their hours and receive overtime pay
(calculability). Finally, you will notice that all store employees are wearing a uniform (and usually a
name tag) so that they can be easily identified. There are security cameras to monitor the store, and
some parts of the store, such as the stockroom, are generally considered off-limits to customers
(control). While McDonaldization has resulted in improved profits and an increased availability of
various goods and services to more people worldwide, it has also reduced the variety of goods available
in the marketplace while rendering available products uniform, generic, and bland. Think of the
difference between a mass-produced shoe and one made by a local cobbler, between a chicken from a
family-owned farm versus a corporate grower, or a cup of coffee from the local diner instead of one
from Starbucks.

Secrets of the McJob
We often talk about bureaucracies disparagingly, and no organization takes more heat than fast
food restaurants. The book and movie Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal
by Eric Schossler paints an ugly picture of what goes in, what goes on, and what comes out of fast
food chains. From their environmental impact to their role in the US obesity epidemic, fast food
chains are connected to numerous societal ills. Furthermore, working at a fast food restaurant is
often disparaged, and even referred to dismissively, as a McJob rather than a real job.
But business school professor Jerry Newman went undercover and worked behind the counter
at seven fast food restaurants to discover what really goes on there. His book, My Secret Life on
the McJob documents his experience. Newman found, unlike Schossler, that these restaurants have
much good alongside the bad. Specifically, he asserted that the employees were honest and
hardworking, the management was often impressive, and that the jobs required a lot more skill and
effort than most people imagined. In the book, Newman cites a pharmaceutical executive who
states that a fast-food service job on an applicant’s résumé is a plus because it indicates the
employee is reliable and can handle pressure.
So what do you think? Are these McJobs and the organizations that offer them still serving a
role in the economy and people’s careers? Or are they dead-end jobs that typify all that is negative
about large bureaucracies? Have you ever worked in one? Would you?

Section Summary
6.1 Types of Groups
Groups largely define how we think of ourselves. There are two main types of groups: primary and
secondary. As the names suggest, the primary group is the long-term, complex one. People use groups
as standards of comparison to define themselves—both who they are and who they are not. Sometimes
groups can be used to exclude people or as a tool that strengthens prejudice.

6.2 Group Size and Structure
The size and dynamic of a group greatly affects how members act. Primary groups rarely have formal
leaders, although there can be informal leadership. Groups generally are considered large when there
are too many members for a simultaneous discussion. In secondary groups there are two types of
leadership functions, with expressive leaders focused on emotional health and wellness, and
instrumental leaders more focused on results. Further, there are different leadership styles: democratic
leaders, authoritarian leaders, and laissez-faire leaders.
Within a group, conformity is the extent to which people want to go along with the norm. A number of
experiments have illustrated how strong the drive to conform can be. It is worth considering real-life
examples of how conformity and obedience can lead people to ethically and morally suspect acts.

6.3 Formal Organizations
Large organizations fall into three main categories: normative/voluntary, coercive, and utilitarian. We
live in a time of contradiction: while the pace of change and technology are requiring people to be more
nimble and less bureaucratic in their thinking, large bureaucracies like hospitals, schools, and
governments are more hampered than ever by their organizational format. At the same time, the past
few decades have seen the development of a trend to bureaucratize and conventionalize local
institutions. Increasingly, Main Streets across the country resemble each other; instead of a Bob’s
Coffee Shop and Jane’s Hair Salon there is a Dunkin Donuts and a Supercuts. This trend has been
referred to as the McDonaldization of society.

Introduction to Deviance, Crime, and Social Control
Philip Hudson entered Morehouse College at age 19 wearing men’s jeans and long hair tied back in
dreadlocks. “The first day I got to campus, I was a boy,” Philip recalled a few years later. He said he
was “trying to be this masculine boy, real cool and real quiet.” By the end of his sophomore year, Philip

141

142

CHAPTER 7 | DEVIANCE, CRIME, AND SOCIAL CONTROL

had swapped his jeans for skirts and found himself the target of a strong backlash (King 2010).
Morehouse College made national news for its response to the teen’s lifestyle, establishing a
schoolwide ban on the wearing of women’s clothing by men (Chen 2010).
Morehouse College, an all-male college in Atlanta, Georgia, has a prestigious history. Established
in 1867 as a place of higher learning for former slaves, Morehouse is the alma mater of great leaders
such as “Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Howard Thurman, and celebrities such as Samuel L. Jackson
and Spike Lee” (Mungin 2009). The sense of revolution is what brought Philip to Morehouse, a place
where he hoped he could be himself.
After a difficult upbringing where his gendered-ness resulted in abuse and rape, he realized that he
identified as a female and wanted to express that aspect of his person. He began taking female
hormones to start his biological transition to the female sex. Although Philip initially halted his
treatment once he began college, he soon found others like himself. At Morehouse, he met Diamond
Poulin, a student who defined himself as a man who felt comfortable in women’s clothes. Joined by a
handful of others, Philip and Diamond donned skirts, high heels, and other traditionally female attire on
campus in an attempt to be themselves. They were jeered at and ridiculed—even attacked.
Then came the school’s shocking decision in late 2009. The new rules, titled the “Appropriate
Attire Policy,” banned cross-dressing anywhere on the campus grounds. Those who broke the rules
were not allowed to attend class unless they changed their clothing, and multiple transgressions led to
disciplinary action and suspension.
Diamond left Morehouse that fall, but returned once in the spring to visit his friends. He found
himself escorted off campus by school security for violating the dress code. Philip remained at
Morehouse for another year before leaving because of stress. He now plans to resume his studies at a
larger university in Florida. What he’s most looking forward to is walking around in public without
being verbally attacked. “They’ll stare,” Philip says with resignation, “but I’m used to that” (King
2010).

7.1 Deviance and Control

Figure 7.2 Much of the appeal of watching entertainers perform in drag comes from the humor inherent in seeing everyday
norms violated. (Photo courtesy of Cassiopeija/Wikimedia Commons)
What, exactly, is deviance? And what is the relationship between deviance and crime? As Philip
Hudson found out, some behaviors, such as wearing clothes of the opposite sex, can be deviant in
certain places, criminal in some places, and perfectly acceptable elsewhere. According to sociologist
William Graham Sumner, deviance is a violation of established contextual, cultural, or social norms,
whether folkways, mores, or codified law (1906). It can be as minor as picking one’s nose in public or
as major as committing murder. Although the word “deviance” has a negative connotation in everyday
language, sociologists recognize that deviance is not necessarily bad (Schoepflin 2011). In fact, from a
structural functionalist perspective, one of the positive contributions of deviance is that it fosters social
change. For example, during the U.S. civil rights movement, Rosa Parks violated social norms when
she refused to move to the “black section” of the bus, and the Little Rock Nine broke customs of
segregation to attend an Arkansas public school.
“What is deviant behavior?” cannot be answered in a straightforward manner. Whether an act is
labeled deviant or not depends on many factors, including location, audience, and the individual
committing the act (Becker 1963). Listening to your iPod on the way to class is considered acceptable
behavior. Listening to your iPod during your 2 o’clock sociology lecture is considered rude. Listening

CHAPTER 7 | DEVIANCE, CRIME, AND SOCIAL CONTROL

to your iPod when on the witness stand before a judge may cause you to be held in contempt of court,
and consequently fined or jailed.
As norms vary across culture and time, it makes sense that notions of deviance change also. Fifty
years ago, public schools in the United States had strict dress codes that, among other stipulations, often
banned women from wearing pants to class. Today, it’s socially acceptable for women to wear pants,
but less so for men to wear skirts. In a time of war, acts usually considered morally reprehensible, such
as taking the life of another, may actually be rewarded. Whether an act is deviant or not depends on
society’s response to that act.

Careers in Sociology

Why I Drive a Hearse
When sociologist Todd Schoepflin ran into his childhood friend Bill, he was shocked to see him
driving a hearse. A professionally trained researcher, Schoepflin wondered what effect driving a
hearse had on his friend and what effect it might have on others on the road. Would using such a
vehicle for everyday errands be considered deviant by most people?
Schoepflin interviewed Bill, curious first to know why he drove such an unconventional car.
Bill had simply been on the lookout for a reliable winter car; on a tight budget, he searched used
car ads and stumbled upon one for the hearse. The car ran well and the price was right, so he
bought it.
Bill admitted that others’ reactions to the car had been mixed. His parents were appalled and
he received odd stares from his coworkers. A mechanic once refused to work on it, stating that it
was “a dead person machine.” On the whole, however, Bill received mostly positive reactions.
Strangers gave him a thumbs-up on the highway and stopped him in parking lots to chat about his
car. His girlfriend loved it, his friends wanted to take it tailgating, and people offered to buy it.
Could it be that driving a hearse isn’t really so deviant after all?
Schoepflin theorized that, although viewed as outside conventional norms, driving a hearse is
such a mild form of deviance that it actually becomes a mark of distinction. Conformists find the
choice of vehicle intriguing or appealing, while nonconformists see a fellow oddball to whom they
can relate. As one of Bill’s friends remarked, “Every guy wants to own a unique car like this and
you can certainly pull it off.” Such anecdotes remind us that although deviance is often viewed as a
violation of norms, it’s not always viewed in a negative light (Schoepflin 2011).

Social Control
When a person violates a social norm, what happens? A driver caught speeding can receive a speeding
ticket. A student who wears a bathrobe to class gets a warning from a professor. An adult belching
loudly is avoided. All societies practice social control, the regulation and enforcement of norms. The
underlying goal of social control is to maintain social order, an arrangement of practices and behaviors
on which society’s members base their daily lives. Think of social order as an employee handbook and

143

144

CHAPTER 7 | DEVIANCE, CRIME, AND SOCIAL CONTROL

social control as a manager. When a worker violates a workplace guideline, the manager steps in to
enforce the rules.
The means of enforcing rules are known as sanctions. Sanctions can be positive as well as
negative. Positive sanctions are rewards given for conforming to norms. A promotion at work is a
positive sanction for working hard. Negative sanctions are punishments for violating norms. Being
arrested is a punishment for shoplifting. Both types of sanctions play a role in social control.
Sociologists also classify sanctions as formal or informal. Although shoplifting, a form of social
deviance, may be illegal, there are no laws dictating the proper way to scratch one’s nose. That doesn’t
mean picking your nose in public won’t be punished; instead, you will encounter informal sanctions.
Informal sanctions emerge in face-to-face social interactions. For example, wearing flip-flops to an
opera or swearing loudly in church may draw disapproving looks or even verbal reprimands, whereas
behavior that is seen as positive—such as helping an old man carry grocery bags across the street—may
receive positive informal reactions, such as a smile or pat on the back.
Formal sanctions, on the other hand, are ways to officially recognize and enforce norm violations.
If a student violates her college’s code of conduct, for example, she might be expelled. Someone who
speaks inappropriately to the boss could be fired. Someone who commits a crime may be arrested or
imprisoned. On the positive side, a soldier who saves a life may receive an official commendation.
The table below shows the relationship between different types of sanctions.
Table 7.1 Informal/Formal Sanctions Formal and
informal sanctions may be positive or negative. Informal
sanctions arise in social interactions, whereas formal
sanctions officially enforce norms.

7.2 Theoretical Perspectives on Deviance

Figure 7.4 Functionalists believe that deviance plays an important role in society and can be used to challenge people’s
views. Protesters, such as these PETA members, often use this method to draw attention to their cause. (Photo courtesy of
David Shankbone/flickr)
Why does deviance occur? How does it affect a society? Since the early days of sociology, scholars
have developed theories attempting to explain what deviance and crime mean to society. These theories
can be grouped according to the three major sociological paradigms: functionalism, symbolic
interactionism, and conflict theory.

Functionalism
Sociologists who follow the functionalist approach are concerned with how the different elements of a
society contribute to the whole. They view deviance as a key component of a functioning society. Strain
theory, social disorganization theory, and cultural deviance theory represent three functionalist
perspectives on deviance in society.
Émile Durkheim: The Essential Nature of Deviance
Émile Durkheim believed that deviance is a necessary part of a successful society. One way deviance is
functional, he argued, is that it challenges people’s present views (1893). For instance, when black

CHAPTER 7 | DEVIANCE, CRIME, AND SOCIAL CONTROL

students across the United States participated in “sit-ins” during the civil rights movement, they
challenged society’s notions of segregation. Moreover, Durkheim noted, when deviance is punished, it
reaffirms currently held social norms, which also contributes to society (1893). Seeing a student given
detention for skipping class reminds other high schoolers that playing hooky isn’t allowed and that they,
too, could get detention.
Robert Merton: Strain Theory
Sociologist Robert Merton agreed that deviance is an inherent part of a functioning society, but he
expanded on Durkheim’s ideas by developing strain theory, which notes that access to socially
acceptable goals plays a part in determining whether a person conforms or deviates. From birth, we’re
encouraged to achieve the “American Dream” of financial success. A woman who attends business
school, receives her MBA, and goes on to make a million-dollar income as CEO of a company is said
to be a success. However, not everyone in our society stands on equal footing. A person may have the
socially acceptable goal of financial success but lack a socially acceptable way to reach that goal.
According to Merton’s theory, an entrepreneur who can’t afford to launch his own company may be
tempted to embezzle from his employer for start-up funds.
Merton defined five ways that people respond to this gap between having a socially accepted goal
but no socially accepted way to pursue it.
1. Conformity: Those who conform choose not to deviate. They pursue their goals to the extent that
they can through socially accepted means.
2. Innovation: Those who innovate pursue goals they cannot reach through legitimate means by
instead using criminal or deviant means.
3. Ritualism: People who ritualize lower their goals until they can reach them through socially
acceptable ways. These members of society focus on conformity rather than attaining a distant
dream.
4. Retreatism: Others retreat and reject society’s goals and means. Some beggars and street people
have withdrawn from society’s goal of financial success.
5. Rebellion: A handful of people rebel, replacing a society’s goals and means with their own.
Terrorists or freedom fighters look to overthrow a society’s goals through socially unacceptable
means.
Social Disorganization Theory
Developed by researchers at the University of Chicago in the 1920s and 1930s, social disorganization
theory asserts that crime is most likely to occur in communities with weak social ties and the absence
of social control. An individual who grows up in a poor neighborhood with high rates of drug use,
violence, teenage delinquency, and deprived parenting is more likely to become a criminal than an
individual from a wealthy neighborhood with a good school system and families who are involved
positively in the community.

Figure 7.5 Proponents of social disorganization theory believe that individuals who grow up in impoverished areas are
more likely to participate in deviant or criminal behaviors. (Photo courtesy of Apollo 1758/Wikimedia Commons)
Social disorganization theory points to broad social factors as the cause of deviance. A person isn’t
born a criminal, but becomes one over time, often based on factors in his or her social environment.
Research into social disorganization theory can greatly influence public policy. For instance, studies
have found that children from disadvantaged communities who attend preschool programs that teach
basic social skills are significantly less likely to engage in criminal activity.

CHAPTER 7 | DEVIANCE, CRIME, AND SOCIAL CONTROL

Clifford Shaw and Henry McKay: Cultural Deviance Theory
Cultural deviance theory suggests that conformity to the prevailing cultural norms of lower-class
society causes crime. Researchers Clifford Shaw and Henry McKay (1942) studied crime patterns in
Chicago in the early 1900s. They found that violence and crime were at their worst in the middle of the
city and gradually decreased the farther one traveled from the urban center toward the suburbs. Shaw
and McKay noticed that this pattern matched the migration patterns of Chicago citizens. New
immigrants, many of them poor and lacking knowledge of English, lived in neighborhoods inside the
city. As the urban population expanded, wealthier people moved to the suburbs, leaving behind the less
privileged.
Shaw and McKay concluded that socioeconomic status correlated to race and ethnicity resulted in
a higher crime rate. The mix of cultures and values created a smaller society with different ideas of
deviance, and those values and ideas were transferred from generation to generation.
The theory of Shaw and McKay has been further tested and expounded upon by Robert Sampson
and Byron Groves (1989). They found that poverty, ethnic diversity, and family disruption in given
localities had a strong positive correlation with social disorganization. They also determined that social
disorganization was, in turn, associated with high rates of crime and delinquency—or deviance. Recent
studies Sampson conducted with Lydia Bean (2006) revealed similar findings. High rates of poverty
and single-parent homes correlated with high rates of juvenile violence.

Conflict Theory
Conflict theory looks to social and economic factors as the causes of crime and deviance. Unlike
functionalists, conflict theorists don’t see these factors as positive functions of society, but as evidence
of inequality in the system. They also challenge social disorganization theory and control theory,
arguing that both ignore racial and socioeconomic issues and oversimplify social trends (Akers 1991).
Conflict theorists also look for answers to the correlation of gender and race with wealth and crime.
Karl Marx: An Unequal System
Conflict theory is derived greatly from the work of sociologist, philosopher, and revolutionary Karl
Marx. Marx divided the general population into two rigid social groups: the proletariat and the
bourgeois. The bourgeois are a small and wealthy segment of society who controls the means of
production, while the proletariat is composed of the workers who rely on those means of production for
employment and survival. By centralizing these vital resources into few hands, the bourgeois also has
the means to control the way society is regulated—from laws, to government, to other authority
agencies—which gives the bourgeois the opportunity to maintain and expand their power in society.
Though Marx spoke little of deviance, his ideas created the foundation for conflict theorists who study
the intersection of deviance and crime with wealth and power.
C. Wright Mills: The Power Elite
In his book The Power Elite (1956), sociologist C. Wright Mills described the existence of what he
dubbed the power elite, a small group of wealthy and influential people at the top of society who hold
the power and resources. Wealthy executives, politicians, celebrities, and military leaders often have
access to national and international power, and in some cases, their decisions affect everyone in society.
Because of this, the rules of society are stacked in favor of a privileged few who manipulate them to
stay on top. It is these people who decide what is criminal and what is not, and the effects are often felt
most by those who have little power. Mills’ theories explain why celebrities such as Chris Brown and
Paris Hilton, or once-powerful politicians such as Eliot Spitzer and Tom DeLay, can commit crimes
with little or no legal retribution.
Crime and Social Class
While crime is often associated with the underprivileged, crimes committed by the wealthy and
powerful remain an under-punished and costly problem within society. The FBI reported that victims of
burglary, larceny, and motor vehicle theft lost a total of $15.3 billion dollars in 2009 (FB1 2010). In
comparison, when Bernie Madoff was arrested in 2008, the US Securities and Exchange Commission
reported that the estimated losses of his financial Ponzi scheme fraud were close to $50 billion (SEC
2009).
This imbalance based on class power is also found within US criminal law. In the 1980s, the use of
crack cocaine (cocaine in its purest form) quickly became an epidemic sweeping the country’s poorest
urban communities. Its pricier counterpart, cocaine, was associated with upscale users and was a drug
of choice for the wealthy. The legal implications of being caught by authorities with crack versus
cocaine were starkly different. In 1986, federal law mandated that being caught in possession of 50

CHAPTER 7 | DEVIANCE, CRIME, AND SOCIAL CONTROL

grams of crack was punishable by a 10-year prison sentence. An equivalent prison sentence for cocaine
possession, however, required possession of 5,000 grams. In other words, the sentencing disparity was
1 to 100 (New York Times Editorial Staff 2011). This inequality in the severity of punishment for crack
versus cocaine paralleled the unequal social class of respective users. A conflict theorist would note that
those in society who hold the power are also the ones who make the laws concerning crime. In doing
so, they make laws that will benefit them, while the powerless classes who lack the resources to make
such decisions suffer the consequences. The crack-cocaine punishment disparity remained until 2010,
when President Obama signed the Fair Sentencing Act, which decreased the disparity to 1 to 18 (The
Sentencing Project 2010).

the punishment for cocaine use, a drug favored by the wealthy. (Photo courtesy of Wikimedia Commons)

Symbolic Interactionism
Symbolic interactionism is a theoretical approach that can be used to explain how societies and/or
social groups come to view behaviors as deviant or conventional. Labeling theory, differential
association, social disorganization theory, and control theory fall within the realm of symbolic
interactionism.
Labeling Theory
Although all of us violate norms from time to time, few people would consider themselves deviant.
Those who do, however, have often been labeled “deviant” by society and have gradually come to
believe it themselves. Labeling theory examines the ascribing of a deviant behavior to another person
by members of society. Thus, what is considered deviant is determined not so much by the behaviors
themselves or the people who commit them, but by the reactions of others to these behaviors. As a
result, what is considered deviant changes over time and can vary significantly across cultures.
Sociologist Edwin Lemert expanded on the concepts of labeling theory, identifying two types of
deviance that affect identity formation. Primary deviance is a violation of norms that does not result in
any long-term effects on the individual’s self-image or interactions with others. Speeding is a deviant
act, but receiving a speeding ticket generally does not make others view you as a bad person, nor does it
alter your own self-concept. Individuals who engage in primary deviance still maintain a feeling of
belonging in society and are likely to continue to conform to norms in the future.
Sometimes, in more extreme cases, primary deviance can morph into secondary deviance.
Secondary deviance occurs when a person’s self-concept and behavior begin to change after his or her
actions are labeled as deviant by members of society. The person may begin to take on and fulfill the
role of a “deviant” as an act of rebellion against the society that has labeled that individual as such. For
example, consider a high school student who often cuts class and gets into fights. The student is
reprimanded frequently by teachers and school staff, and soon enough, he develops a reputation as a
“troublemaker.” As a result, the student starts acting out even more and breaking more rules; he has
adopted the “troublemaker” label and embraced this deviant identity. Secondary deviance can be so
strong that it bestows a master status on an individual. A master status is a label that describes the
chief characteristic of an individual. Some people see themselves primarily as doctors, artists, or
grandfathers. Others see themselves as beggars, convicts, or addicts.

Social Policy

& Debate

The Right to Vote
Before she lost her job as an administrative assistant, Leola Strickland postdated and mailed a
handful of checks for amounts ranging from $90 to $500. By the time she was able to find a new
job, the checks had bounced, and she was convicted of fraud under Mississippi law. Strickland
pleaded guilty to a felony charge and repaid her debts; in return, she was spared from serving
prison time.
Strickland appeared in court in 2001. More than ten years later, she is still feeling the sting of
her sentencing. Why? Because Mississippi is one of 12 states in the United States that bans
convicted felons from voting (ProCon 2011).
To Strickland, who said she had always voted, the news came as a great shock. She isn’t
alone. Some 5.3 million people in the United States are currently barred from voting because of
felony convictions (ProCon 2009). These individuals include inmates, parolees, probationers, and
even people who have never been jailed, such as Leola Strickland.
Under the Fourteenth Amendment, states are allowed to deny voting privileges to individuals
who have participated in “rebellion or other crime” (Krajick 2004). Although there are no federally
mandated laws on the matter, most states practice at least one form of felony disenfranchisement.
At present, it’s estimated that approximately 2.4 percent of the possible voting population is
disfranchised, that is, lacking the right to vote (ProCon 2011).
Is it fair to prevent citizens from participating in such an important process? Proponents of
disfranchisement laws argue that felons have a debt to pay to society. Being stripped of their right
to vote is part of the punishment for criminal deeds. Such proponents point out that voting isn’t the
only instance in which ex-felons are denied rights; state laws also ban released criminals from
holding public office, obtaining professional licenses, and sometimes even inheriting property
(Lott and Jones 2008).
Opponents of felony disfranchisement in the United States argue that voting is a basic human
right and should be available to all citizens regardless of past deeds. Many point out that felony
disfranchisement has its roots in the 1800s, when it was used primarily to block black citizens
from voting. Even nowadays, these laws disproportionately target poor minority members,
denying them a chance to participate in a system that, as a social conflict theorist would point out,
is already constructed to their disadvantage (Holding 2006). Those who cite labeling theory worry
that denying deviants the right to vote will only further encourage deviant behavior. If ex-criminals
are disenfranchised from voting, are they being disenfranchised from society?

CHAPTER 7 | DEVIANCE, CRIME, AND SOCIAL CONTROL

Edwin Sutherland: Differential Association
In the early 1900s, sociologist Edwin Sutherland sought to understand how deviant behavior developed
among people. Since criminology was a young field, he drew on other aspects of sociology including
social interactions and group learning (Laub 2006). His conclusions established differential
association theory, stating that individuals learn deviant behavior from those close to them who
provide models of and opportunities for deviance. According to Sutherland, deviance is less a personal
choice and more a result of differential socialization processes. A tween whose friends are sexually
active is more likely to view sexual activity as acceptable.
Sutherland’s theory may account for why crime is multigenerational. A longitudinal study
beginning in the 1960s found that the best predictor of antisocial and criminal behavior in children was
whether their parents had been convicted of a crime (Todd and Jury 1996). Children who were younger
than 10 when their parents were convicted were more likely than other children to engage in spousal
abuse and criminal behavior by their early thirties. Even when taking socioeconomic factors such as
dangerous neighborhoods, poor school systems, and overcrowded housing into consideration,
researchers found that parents were the main influence on the behavior of their offspring (Todd and Jury
1996).
Travis Hirschi: Control Theory
Continuing with an examination of large social factors, control theory states that social control is
directly affected by the strength of social bonds and that deviance results from a feeling of
disconnection from society. Individuals who believe they are a part of society are less likely to commit
crimes against it.
Travis Hirschi (1969) identified four types of social bonds that connect people to society:
1. Attachment measures our connections to others. When we are closely attached to people, we worry
about their opinions of us. People conform to society’s norms in order to gain approval (and
prevent disapproval) from family, friends, and romantic partners.
2. Commitment refers to the investments we make in the community. A well-respected local
businesswoman who volunteers at her synagogue and is a member of the neighborhood block
organization has more to lose from committing a crime than a woman who doesn’t have a career
or ties to the community.
3. Similarly, levels of involvement, or participation in socially legitimate activities, lessen a person’s
likelihood of deviance. Children who are members of little league baseball teams have fewer
family crises.

149

150

CHAPTER 7 | DEVIANCE, CRIME, AND SOCIAL CONTROL

4. The final bond, belief, is an agreement on common values in society. If a person views social
values as beliefs, he or she will conform to them. An environmentalist is more likely to pick up
trash in a park because a clean environment is a social value to him (Hirschi 1969).

7.3 Crime and the Law

Figure 7.8 How is a crime different from other types of deviance? (Photo courtesy of Duffman/Wikimedia Commons.)
On December 16, 2011, 20-year-old Colton Harris-Moore was sentenced to seven years in prison by an
Island County judge after pleading guilty to dozens of charges including burglary, fraud, and identity
theft. Harris-Moore, dubbed the “Barefoot Bandit,” spent two years evading the police by means of
transportation theft and squatting, frequently leaving a trail of bare footprints in his wake (Johnson
2011).
"Colton's very pleased (with the sentence)," his attorney John Henry Browne told the New York
Times. "He was expecting the worst."
The son of an alcoholic mother, Harris-Moore’s life was filled with physical and verbal abuse, and
a series of convict boyfriends frequently inhabited the Harris-Moore home. After dropping out of
school in the ninth grade, Harris Moore’s crimes increased in severity. His antics gained worldwide
media attention after he began stealing and successfully piloting planes, though he’d had no aviation
training. When authorities caught him, he was driving a stolen boat off the coast of the Bahamas
(Yardley 2010).
"This case is a tragedy in many ways,” said Judge Churchill, “but it's a triumph of the human spirit
in other ways. I could have been reading about the history of a mass murderer. I could have been
reading about a drug abusive, alcoholic young man. That is the triumph of Colton Harris-Moore: He has
survived" (Johnson 2011).
Though the judge’s ruling was largely sympathetic, Harris-Moore had immediate regrets. "Let me
put it this way,” said his attorney. “He wishes he had done things a little differently in his life" (CNN
News Wire Staff 2010).
Although deviance is a violation of social norms, it’s not always punishable, and it’s not
necessarily bad. Crime, on the other hand, is a behavior that violates official law and is punishable
through formal sanctions. Walking to class backwards is a deviant behavior. Driving with a blood
alcohol percentage over the state’s limit is a crime. Like other forms of deviance, however, ambiguity
exists concerning what constitutes a crime and whether all crimes are, in fact, “bad” and deserve
punishment. For example, during the 1960s, civil rights activists often violated laws intentionally as
part of their effort to bring about racial equality. In hindsight, we recognize that the laws that deemed
many of their actions crimes—for instance, Rosa Parks taking a seat in the “whites only” section of the
bus—were inconsistent with social equality.
As you learned previously, all societies have informal and formal ways of maintaining social
control. Within these systems of norms, societies have legal codes that maintain formal social control
through laws, which are rules adopted and enforced by a political authority. Those who violate these
rules incur negative formal sanctions. Normally, punishments are relative to the degree of the crime and
the importance to society of the value underlying the law. As we will see, however, there are other
factors that influence criminal sentencing.

CHAPTER 7 | DEVIANCE, CRIME, AND SOCIAL CONTROL

Types of Crimes
Not all crimes are given equal weight. Society generally socializes its members to view certain crimes
as more severe than others. For example, most people would consider murdering someone to be far
worse than stealing a wallet and would expect a murderer to be punished more severely than a thief. In
modern American society, crimes are classified as one of two types based on their severity. Violent
crimes (also known as “crimes against a person”) are based on the use of force or the threat of force.
Rape, murder, and armed robbery fall under this category. Nonviolent crimes involve the destruction or
theft of property, but do not use force or the threat of force. Because of this, they are also sometimes
called “property crimes.” Larceny, car theft, and vandalism are all types of nonviolent crimes. If you
use a crowbar to break into a car, you are committing a nonviolent crime; if you mug someone with the
crowbar, you are committing a violent crime.
When we think of crime, we often picture street crime, or offenses committed by ordinary people
against other people or organizations, usually in public spaces. An often overlooked category is
corporate crime, or crime committed by white-collar workers in a business environment.
Embezzlement, insider trading, and identity theft are all types of corporate crime. Although these types
of offenses rarely receive the same amount of media coverage as street crimes, they can be far more
damaging. The current economic recession in the United States is the ultimate result of a financial
collapse triggered by corporate crime.
An often-debated third type of crime is victimless crime. These are called victimless because the
perpetrator is not explicitly harming another person. As opposed to battery or theft, which clearly have
a victim, a crime like drinking a beer at age 20 or selling a sexual act do not result in injury to anyone
other than the individual who engages in them, although they are illegal. While some claim acts like
these are victimless, others argue that they actually do harm society. Prostitution may foster abuse
toward women by clients or pimps. Drug use may increase the likelihood of employee absences. Such
debates highlight how the deviant and criminal nature of actions develops through ongoing public
discussion.

the

Big Picture

Hate Crimes
On the evening of October 3, 2010, a 17-year-old boy from the Bronx was abducted by a group of
young men from his neighborhood and taken to an abandoned row house. After being beaten, the
boy admitted he was gay. His attackers seized his partner and beat him as well. Both victims were
drugged, sodomized, and forced to burn one another with cigarettes. When questioned by police,
the ringleader of the crime explained that the victims were gay and “looked like [they] liked it”
(Wilson and Baker 2010).
Attacks based on a person’s race, religion, or other characteristics are known as hate crimes.
Hate crimes in the United States evolved from the time of early European settlers and their
violence toward Native Americans. Such crimes weren’t investigated until the early 1900s, when
the Ku Klux Klan began to draw national attention for its activities against blacks and other
groups. The term “hate crime,” however, didn’t become official until the1980s (Federal Bureau of
Investigations 2011).
An average of 195,000 Americans fall victim to hate crimes each year, but fewer than five
percent ever report the crime (FBI 2010). The majority of hate crimes are racially motivated, but
many are based on religious (especially anti-Semitic) prejudice (FBI 2010). After incidents like the
murder of Matthew Shepard in Wyoming in 1998 and the tragic suicide of Rutgers University
student Tyler Clementi in 2010, there has been a growing awareness of hate crimes based on
sexual orientation.

151

152

CHAPTER 7 | DEVIANCE, CRIME, AND SOCIAL CONTROL

Figure 7.9 In the United States, there were 8,336 reported victims of hate crimes in 2009. This represents less than
five percent of the number of people who claimed to be victims of hate crimes when surveyed. (Graph courtesy of FBI
2010)

Crime Statistics
What crimes are people in the United States most likely to commit, and who is most likely to commit
them? To understand criminal statistics, you must first understand how these statistics are collected.
Since 1930, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has been collecting and publishing an archive of
crime statistics. Known as Uniform Crime Reports (UCR), these annual publications contain data from
approximately 17,000 law enforcement agencies (FBI 2011). Although the UCR contains
comprehensive data on police reports, it fails to take into account the fact that many crimes go
unreported due to the victim’s unwillingness to report them, largely based on fear, shame, or distrust of
the police. The quality of the data collected by the UCR also varies greatly. Because officers’
approaches to gathering victims’ accounts frequently differed, important details were not always asked
for or reported (Cantor and Lynch 2000).
To offset this publication, in 1973 the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics began to publish a separate
report known as the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS). The NCVS is a self-report study. A
self-report study is a collection of data acquired using voluntary response methods, such as
questionnaires or telephone interviews. Each year, survey data are gathered from approximately
135,000 people in the United States on the frequency and type of crime they experience in their daily
lives (BJS 2011). The surveys are thorough, providing a wider scope of information than was
previously available. This allows researchers to examine crime from more detailed perspectives and to
analyze the data based on factors such as the relationship between victims and offenders, the
consequences of the crimes, and substance abuse involved in the crimes. Demographics are also
analyzed, such as age, race, gender, location, and income level (National Archive of Criminal Justice
Data 2010). The NCVS reports a higher rate of crime than the UCR.
Though the NCVS is a critical source of statistical information, disadvantages exist. “Nonresponse,” or a victim’s failure to participate in the survey or a particular question, is among them.
Inability to contact important demographics, such as those who don’t have access to phones or
frequently relocate, also skews the data. For those who participate, memory issues can be problematic
for the data sets. Some victims’ recollection of the crimes can be inaccurate or simply forgotten over
time (Cantor and Lynch 2000).
While neither of these publications can take into account all of the crimes committed in the
country, some general trends may be noted. Crime rates were on the rise after 1960, but following an
all-time high in the 1980s and 1990s, rates of violent and non-violent crimes once again started to
decline.
In 2009, approximately 4.3 million violent crimes occurred in the United States, the majority being
assault and robbery. An estimated 15.6 million nonviolent crimes took place, the most common being
larceny. Less than half of all violent and nonviolent crimes were reported to the police (BJS 2010).

CHAPTER 7 | DEVIANCE, CRIME, AND SOCIAL CONTROL

In general, demographic patterns tend to correlate with crime: factors such as sex and
socioeconomic status may relate to a person’s chances of being a crime victim or a perpetrator. Women
are much more likely than men to be victimized by someone they know, such as a family member or
friend, and one-fourth of all nonfatal attacks on women are carried out by a romantic partner (BJS
2011b).

The United States Criminal Justice System
A criminal justice system is an organization that exists to enforce a legal code. There are three
branches of the United States criminal justice system: the police, the courts, and the corrections system.
Police
Police are a civil force in charge of enforcing laws and public order at a federal, state, or community
level. No unified national police force exists in the United States, although there are federal law
enforcement officers. Federal officers operate under specific government agencies such as the Federal
Bureau of Investigations (FBI); the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF); and
the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Federal officers can only deal with matters that are
explicitly within the power of the federal government, and their field of expertise is usually narrow. A
county police officer may spend time responding to emergency calls, working at the local jail, or
patrolling areas as needed, whereas a federal officer would be more likely to investigate suspects in
firearms trafficking or provide security for government officials.
State police have the authority to enforce statewide laws, including regulating traffic on highways.
Local or county police, on the other hand, have a limited jurisdiction with authority only in the town or
county in which they serve.

Courts
Once a crime has been committed and a violator is identified by the police, the case goes to the court. A
court is a system that has the authority to make decisions based on law. Similar to the police, the U.S.
judicial system is divided into federal courts and state courts. As the name implies, federal courts
(including the U.S. Supreme Court) deal with federal matters, including trade disputes, military justice,
and government lawsuits. Judges who preside over federal courts are selected by the president with the
consent of Congress.
State courts vary in their structure, but generally include three levels: trial courts, appellate courts,
and state supreme courts. Unlike the large courtroom trials in TV shows, most noncriminal cases are
decided by a judge without a jury present. Traffic court and small claims court are both types of trial
courts that handle specific civil matters.
Criminal cases are heard by trial courts that handle general jurisdictions. Usually, a judge and jury
are both present. It is the jury’s responsibility to determine guilt, and the judge’s responsibility to
determine the penalty, though in some states, the jury may also decide the penalty. Unless a defendant is
found “not guilty,” any member of the prosecution or defense can appeal the case to a higher court. In
some states, the case then goes to a special appellate court; in others, it goes to the highest state court,
often known as the state supreme court.

Corrections
The corrections system, more commonly known as the prison system, is tasked with supervising
individuals who have been arrested, convicted, and sentenced for a criminal offense. At the end of
2010, approximately seven million Americans were behind bars (BJS 2011d).
The United States incarceration rate has grown considerably in the last hundred years. In 2008,
more than 1 in 100 U.S. adults were in jail or prison, the highest benchmark in our nation’s history. And
while Americans account for 5 percent of the global population, we have 25 percent of the world’s
inmates, the largest number of prisoners in the world (Liptak 2008b).
Prison is different from jail. A jail provides temporary confinement, usually while an individual
awaits trial or parole. Prisons are facilities built for individuals serving sentences of more than a year.
Whereas jails are small and local, prisons are large and run by either the state or the federal
government.
Parole refers to a temporary release from prison or jail that requires supervision and the consent of
officials. Parole is different from probation, which is supervised time used as an alternative to prison.
Probation and parole can both follow a period of incarceration in prison, especially if the prison
sentence is shortened.

Section Summary
7.1 Deviance and Control
Deviance is a violation of norms. Whether or not something is deviant depends on contextual
definitions, the situation, and people’s response to the behavior. Society seeks to limit deviance through
the use of sanctions that help maintain a system of social control.

7.2 Theoretical Perspectives on Deviance
The three major sociological paradigms offer different explanations for the motivation behind deviance
and crime. Functionalists point out that deviance is a social necessity since it reinforces norms by
reminding people of the consequences of violating them. Violating norms can open society’s eyes to
injustice in the system. Conflict theorists argue that crime stems from a system of inequality that keeps
those with power at the top and those without power at the bottom. Symbolic interactionists focus

attention on the socially constructed nature of the labels related to deviance. Crime and deviance are
learned from the environment and enforced or discouraged by those around us.

7.3 Crime and the Law
Crime is established by legal codes and upheld by the criminal justice system. In the United States,
there are three branches of the justice system: police, courts, and corrections. Although crime rates
increased throughout most of the 20th century, they are now dropping.

Short Answer
7.1 Deviance and Control
1. If given the choice, would you purchase an unusual car such as a hearse for everyday use? How
would your friends, family, or significant other react? Since deviance is culturally defined, most of the
decisions we make are dependent on the reactions of others. Is there anything the people in your life
encourage you to do that you don’t? Why don’t you?

CHAPTER 7 | DEVIANCE, CRIME, AND SOCIAL CONTROL

2. Think of a recent time when you used informal negative sanctions. To what act of deviance were you
responding? How did your actions affect the deviant person or persons? How did your reaction help
maintain social control?

7.2 Theoretical Perspectives on Deviance
3. Pick a famous politician, business leader, or celebrity who has been arrested recently. What crime did
he or she allegedly commit? Who was the victim? Explain his or her actions from the point of view of
one of the major sociological paradigms. What factors best explain how this person might be punished
if convicted of the crime?
4. If we assume that the power elite’s status is always passed down from generation to generation, how
would Edwin Sutherland explain these patterns of power through differential association theory? What
crimes do these elite few get away with?

7.3 Crime and the Law
5. Recall the crime statistics presented in this section. Do they surprise you? Are these statistics
represented accurately in the media? Why or why not?

7.1 Deviance and Control
Although we rarely think of it in this way, deviance can have a positive effect on society. Check out the
Positive Deviance Initiative, a program initiated by Tufts University to promote social movements
around the world that strive to improve people’s lives, at http://www.positivedeviance.org
(http://www.positivedeviance.org) .

7.2 Theoretical Perspectives on Deviance
The Skull and Bones Society made news in 2004 when it was revealed that then-President George W.
Bush and his Democratic challenger, John Kerry, had both been members at Yale University. In the
years since, conspiracy theorists have linked the secret society to numerous world events, arguing that
many of the nation’s most powerful people are former Bonesmen. Although such ideas may raise a lot
of skepticism, many influential people of the past century have been Skull and Bones Society members,
and the society is sometimes described as a college version of the power elite. Journalist Rebecca
Leung discusses the roots of the club and the impact its ties between decision-makers can have later in
life. Read about it at http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/10/02/60minutes/main576332.shtml

Introduction to Media and Technology
How many good friends do you have? How many people do you meet up with for coffee or a movie?
How many would you call with news about an illness or invite to your wedding? Now, how many
“friends” do you have on Facebook? Technology has changed how we interact with each other. It has
turned “friend” into a verb and has made it possible to share mundane news (“My dog just threw up
under the bed! Ugh!”) with hundreds or even thousands of people who might know you only slightly, if
at all. Through the magic of Facebook, you might know about an old elementary school friend’s new
job before her mother does.

164

CHAPTER 8 | MEDIA AND TECHNOLOGY

At the same time that technology is expanding the boundaries of our social circles, various media
are also changing how we perceive and interact with each other. We don’t only use Facebook to keep in
touch with friends; we also use it to “like” certain TV shows, products, or celebrities. Even television is
no longer a one-way medium but an interactive one. We are encouraged to tweet, text, or call in to vote
for contestants in everything from singing competitions to matchmaking endeavors—bridging the gap
between our entertainment and our own lives.
How does technology change our lives for the better? Or does it? When you tweet a social cause or
cut and paste a status update about cancer awareness on Facebook, are you promoting social change?
Does the immediate and constant flow of information mean we are more aware and engaged than any
society before us? Or are American Idol and Jersey Shore today’s version of ancient Rome’s “bread and
circuses”––distractions and entertainment to keep the lower classes complacent to the inequities of our
society?
These are some of the questions that interest sociologists. How might we examine these issues
from a sociological perspective? A functionalist would probably focus on what social purposes
technology and media serve. For example, the web is both a form of technology and of media, and it
links individuals and nations in a communication network that facilitates both small family discussions
and global trade networks. A functionalist would also be interested in the manifest functions of media
and technology, as well as their role in social dysfunction. Someone applying the conflict perspective
would probably focus on the systematic inequality created by differential access to media and
technology. For example, how can middle-class Americans be sure the news they hear is an objective
account of reality, unsullied by monied political interests? Someone applying the interactionist
perspective to technology and the media might seek to understand the difference between the real lives
we lead and the reality depicted on “reality” television shows, such as Jersey Shore. Throughout this
chapter, we will use our sociological imagination to explore how media and technology impact society.

8.1 Technology Today

Figure 8.2 Technology is the application of science to address the problems of daily life, from hunting tools and agricultural
advances, to manual and electronic ways of computing, to today’s tablets and smartphones. (Photo (a) courtesy of Wikimedia

It is easy to look at the latest sleek tiny Apple product and think that technology is only recently a part
of our world. But from the steam engine to the most cutting-edge robotic surgery tools, technology
describes the application of science to address the problems of daily life. We might look back at the
enormous and clunky computers of the 1970s that had about as much storage as an iPod Shuffle and

CHAPTER 8 | MEDIA AND TECHNOLOGY

roll our eyes in disbelief. But chances are 30 years from now our skinny laptops and MP3 players will
look just as archaic.

What Is Technology?
While most people probably picture computers and cell phones when the subject of technology comes
up, technology is not merely a product of the modern era. For example, fire and stone tools were
important forms that technology developed during the Stone Age. Just as the availability of digital
technology shapes how we live today, the creation of stone tools changed how premodern humans lived
and how well they ate. From the first calculator, invented in 2400 B.C.E. Babylon in the form of an
abacus, to the predecessor of the modern computer, created in 1882 by Charles Babbage, all of our
technological innovations are advancements on previous iterations. And indeed, all aspects of our lives
today are influenced by technology. In agriculture, the introduction of machines that can till, thresh,
plant, and harvest greatly reduced the need for manual labor, which in turn meant there were fewer rural
jobs, which led to the urbanization of society, as well as lowered birthrates because there was less need
for large families to work the farms. In the criminal justice system, the ability to ascertain innocence
through DNA testing has saved the lives of people on death row. The examples are endless: Technology
plays a role in absolutely every aspect of our lives.
Technological Inequality

Figure 8.3 Some schools sport cutting-edge computer labs, while others sport barbed wire. Is your academic technology at
the cusp of innovation, relatively disadvantaged, or somewhere in between? (Photo courtesy of Carlos Martinez/flickr)
As with any improvement to human society, not everyone has equal access. Technology, in particular,
often creates changes that lead to ever greater inequalities. In short, the gap gets wider faster. This
technological stratification has led to a new focus on ensuring better access for all.
There are two forms of technological stratification. The first is differential class-based access to
technology in the form of the digital divide. This digital divide has led to the second form, a knowledge
gap, which is, as it sounds, an ongoing and increasing gap in information for those who have less
access to technology. Simply put, students in well-funded schools receive more exposure to technology
than students in poorly funded schools. Those students with more exposure gain more proficiency,
making them far more marketable in an increasingly technology-based job market, leaving our society
divided into those with technological knowledge and those without. Even as we improve access, we
have failed to address an increasingly evident gap in e-readiness, the ability to sort through, interpret,
and process knowledge (Sciadas 2003).
Since the beginning of the millennium, social science researchers have tried to bring attention to
the digital divide, the uneven access to technology along race, class, and geographic lines. The term
became part of the common lexicon in 1996, when then Vice President Al Gore used it in a speech. This
was the point when personal computer use shifted dramatically, from 300,000 users in 1991 to more
than 10 million users by 1996 (Rappaport 2009). In part, the issue of the digital divide had to do with
communities that received infrastructure upgrades that enabled high-speed internet access, upgrades
that largely went to affluent urban and suburban areas, leaving out large swaths of the country.
At the end of the 20th century, technology access was also a big part of the school experience for
those whose communities could afford it. Early in the millennium, poorer communities had little or no
technology access, while well-off families had personal computers at home and wired classrooms in
their schools. In the 2000s, however, the prices for low-end computers dropped considerably, and it
appeared the digital divide was naturally ending. And while it is true that internet usage, even among
those with low annual incomes, continues to grow, it would be overly simplistic to say that the digital
divide has been completely resolved.

165

CHAPTER 8 | MEDIA AND TECHNOLOGY

In fact, new data from the Pew Research Center (2011) suggest the emergence of a new divide. As
technological devices gets smaller and more mobile, larger percentages of minority groups (such as
Latinos and African Americans) are using their phones to connect to the internet. In fact, about 50
percent of people in these minority groups connect to the web via such devices, whereas only one-third
of whites do (Washington 2011). And while it might seem that the internet is the internet, regardless of
how you get there, there’s a notable difference. Tasks like updating a résumé or filling out a job
application are much harder on a cell phone than on a wired computer in the home. As a result, the
digital divide might not mean access to computers or the internet, but rather access to the kind of online
technology that allows for empowerment, not just entertainment (Washington 2011).
Mossberger, Tolbert, and Gilbert (2006) demonstrated that the majority of the digital divide for
black Americans could be explained by demographic and community-level characteristics, such as
socioeconomic status and geographic location. For the Latino population, ethnicity alone, regardless of
economics or geography, seemed to limit technology use. Liff and Shepard (2004) found that although
the gender digital divide has decreased in the sense of access to technology, it remained in the sense that
women, who are accessing technology shaped primarily by male users, feel less confident in their
internet skills and have less internet access at both work and home. Finally, Guillen and Suarez (2005)
found that the global digital divide resulted from both the economic and sociopolitical characteristics of
countries.

Planned Obsolescence: Technology That’s
Built to Crash

Figure 8.4 People have trouble keeping up with technological innovation. But people may not be to blame, as
manufacturers intentionally develop products with short life spans. (Photo courtesy of Troy Kelly/flickr)
Chances are your mobile phone company, as well as the makers of your DVD player and MP3
device, are all counting on their products to fail. Not too quickly, of course, or consumers wouldn’t
stand for it—but frequently enough that you might find that when the built-in battery on your iPod
dies, it costs far more to fix it than to replace it with a newer model. Or you find that the phone
company e-mails you to tell you that you’re eligible for a free new phone, because yours is a
whopping two years old. And appliance repair people say that while they might be fixing some
machines that are 20 years old, they generally aren’t fixing the ones that are seven years old;
newer models are built to be thrown out. This is called planned obsolescence, and it is the
business practice of planning for a product to be obsolete or unusable from the time it is created.
To some extent, this is a natural extension of new and emerging technologies. After all, who
is going to cling to an enormous and slow desktop computer from 2000 when a few hundred
dollars can buy one that is significantly faster and better? But the practice is not always so benign.
The classic example of planned obsolescence is the nylon stocking. Women’s stockings—once an
everyday staple of women’s lives––get “runs” or “ladders” after a few wearings. This requires the
stockings to be discarded and new ones purchased. Not surprisingly, the garment industry did not
invest heavily in finding a rip-proof fabric; it was in their best interest that their product be
regularly replaced.

CHAPTER 8 | MEDIA AND TECHNOLOGY

Those who use Microsoft Windows might feel that they, like the women who purchase
endless pairs of stockings, are victims of planned obsolescence. Every time Windows releases a
new operating system, there are typically not many changes that consumers feel they must have.
However, the software programs are upwardly compatible only. This means that while the new
versions can read older files, the old version cannot read the newer ones. In short order, those who
have not upgraded find themselves unable to open files sent by colleagues or friends, and usually
wind up upgrading as well.
Ultimately, whether you are getting rid of your old product because you are being offered a
shiny new free one (like the latest smartphone model), or because it costs more to fix than to
replace (like the iPod model), or because not doing so leaves you out of the loop (like the
Windows model), the result is the same. It might just make you nostalgic for your old Sony
Walkman and VCR.

8.2 Media and Technology in Society

Figure 8.5 The modern printing press (as well as its dated counterparts) embodies the intertwined nature of technology
and media. (Photo courtesy of Anuj Biyani/flickr)
Technology and the media are interwoven, and neither can be separated from contemporary society in
most core and semi-peripheral nations. Media is a term that refers to all print, digital, and electronic
means of communication. From the time the printing press was created (and even before), technology
has influenced how and where information is shared. Today, it is impossible to discuss media and the
ways that societies communicate without addressing the fast-moving pace of technology. Twenty years
ago, if you wanted to share news of your baby’s birth or a job promotion, you phoned or wrote letters.
You might tell a handful of people, but probably you wouldn’t call up several hundred, including your
old high school chemistry teacher, to let them know. Now, by tweeting or posting your big news, the
circle of communication is wider than ever. Therefore, when we talk about how societies engage with
technology we must take media into account, and vice versa.
Technology creates media. The comic book you bought your daughter at the drugstore is a form of
media, as is the movie you rented for family night, the internet site you used to order dinner online, the
billboard you passed on the way to get that dinner, and the newspaper you read while you were waiting
to pick up your order. Without technology, media would not exist; but remember, technology is more
than just the media we are exposed to.

Categorizing Technology
There is no one way of dividing technology into categories. Whereas once it might have been simple to
classify innovations such as machine-based or drug-based or the like, the interconnected strands of
technological development mean that advancement in one area might be replicated in dozens of others.
For simplicity’s sake, we will look at how the U.S. Patent Office, which receives patent applications for
nearly all major innovations worldwide, addresses patents. This regulatory body will patent three types
of innovation. Utility patents are the first type. These are granted for the invention or discovery of any
new and useful process, product, or machine, or for a significant improvement to existing technologies.
The second type of patent is a design patent. Commonly conferred in architecture and industrial
design, this means someone has invented a new and original design for a manufactured product. Plant
patents, the final type, recognize the discovery of new plant types that can be asexually reproduced.
While genetically modified food is the hot-button issue within this category, farmers have long been

167

CHAPTER 8 | MEDIA AND TECHNOLOGY

creating new hybrids and patenting them. A more modern example might be food giant Monsanto,
which patents corn with built-in pesticide (U.S. Patent and Trademark Office 2011).
Anderson and Tushman (1990) suggest an evolutionary model of technological change, in which
a breakthrough in one form of technology leads to a number of variations. Once those are assessed, a
prototype emerges, and then a period of slight adjustments to the technology, interrupted by a
breakthrough. For example, floppy disks were improved and upgraded, then replaced by Zip disks,
which were in turn improved to the limits of the technology and were then replaced by flash drives.
This is essentially a generational model for categorizing technology, in which first-generation
technology is a relatively unsophisticated jumping-off point leading to an improved second generation,
and so on.

Types of Media and Technology
Media and technology have evolved hand in hand, from early print to modern publications, from radio
to television to film. New media emerge constantly, such as we see in the online world.
Print Newspaper
Early forms of print media, found in ancient Rome, were hand-copied onto boards and carried around to
keep the citizenry informed. With the invention of the printing press, the way that people shared ideas
changed, as information could be mass produced and stored. For the first time, there was a way to
spread knowledge and information more efficiently; many credit this development as leading to the
Renaissance and ultimately the Age of Enlightenment. This is not to say that newspapers of old were
more trustworthy than the Weekly World News and National Enquirer are today. Sensationalism
abounded, as did censorship that forbade any subjects that would incite the populace.
The invention of the telegraph, in the mid-1800s, changed print media almost as much as the
printing press. Suddenly information could be transmitted in minutes. As the 19th century became the
20th, American publishers such as Hearst redefined the world of print media and wielded an enormous
amount of power to socially construct national and world events. Of course, even as the media empires
of William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer were growing, print media also allowed for the
dissemination of countercultural or revolutionary materials. Internationally, Vladimir Lenin’s Irksa (The
Spark) newspaper was published in 1900 and played a role in Russia’s growing communist movement
(World Association of Newspapers 2004).
With the invention and widespread use of television in the mid-20th century, newspaper circulation
steadily dropped off, and in the 21st century, circulation has dropped further as more people turn to
internet news sites and other forms of new media to stay informed. According to the Pew Research
Center, 2009 saw an unprecedented drop in newspaper circulation––down 10.6 percent from the year
before (Pew 2010).
This shift away from newspapers as a source of information has profound effects on societies.
When the news is given to a large diverse conglomerate of people, it must (to appeal to them and keep
them subscribing) maintain some level of broad-based reporting and balance. As newspapers decline,
news sources become more fractured, so that the audience can choose specifically what it wants to hear
and what it wants to avoid.
Television and Radio
Radio programming obviously preceded television, but both shaped people’s lives in much the same
way. In both cases, information (and entertainment) could be enjoyed at home, with a kind of
immediacy and community that newspapers could not offer. For instance, many older Americans might
remember when they heard on the radio that Pearl Harbor had been bombed, or when they saw on the
television that President John F. Kennedy had been shot. Even though people were in their own homes,
media allowed them to share these moments in real time. This same kind of separate-but-communal
approach occurred with entertainment too. School-aged children and office workers gathered to discuss
the previous night’s installment of a serial television or radio show.
Right up through the 1970s, American television was dominated by three major networks (ABC,
CBS, and NBC) that competed for ratings and advertising dollars. They also exerted a lot of control
over what was being watched. Public television, in contrast, offered an educational nonprofit alternative
to the sensationalization of news spurred by the network competition for viewers and advertising
dollars. Those sources—PBS (Public Broadcasting Service), the BBC (British Broadcasting Company),
and CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Company)—garnered a worldwide reputation for quality
programming and a global perspective. Al Jazeera, the Arabic independent news station, has joined this
group as a similar media force that broadcasts to people worldwide.

CHAPTER 8 | MEDIA AND TECHNOLOGY

The impact of television on American society is hard to overstate. By the late 1990s, 98 percent of
U.S. homes had at least one television set, and the average American watched between two and a half to
five hours of television daily. All this television has a powerful socializing effect, with these forms of
visual media providing reference groups while reinforcing social norms, values, and beliefs.
Film
The film industry took off in the 1930s, when color and sound were first integrated into feature films.
Like television, early films were unifying for society: As people gathered in theaters to watch new
releases, they would laugh, cry, and be scared together. Movies also act as time capsules or cultural
touchstones for society. From tough-talking Clint Eastwood to the biopic of Facebook founder and
Harvard dropout Mark Zuckerberg, movies illustrate society’s dreams, fears, and experiences. While
many Americans consider Hollywood the epicenter of moviemaking, India’s Bollywood actually
produces more films per year, speaking to the cultural aspirations and norms of Indian society.
New Media

Figure 8.6 Twitter has fascinated the world in 140 characters or less. What media innovation will next take the world by
storm? (Photo courtesy of West McGowan/flickr)
New media encompasses all interactive forms of information exchange. These include social
networking sites, blogs, podcasts, wikis, and virtual worlds. Clearly, the list grows almost daily. New
media tends to level the playing field in terms of who is constructing it, i.e., creating, publishing,
distributing, and accessing information (Lievrouw and Livingston 2006), as well as offering alternative
forums to groups unable to gain access to traditional political platforms, such as groups associated with
the Arab Spring protests (van de Donk et al. 2004). However, there is no guarantee of the accuracy of
the information offered. In fact, the immediacy of new media coupled with the lack of oversight means
that we must be more careful than ever to ensure our news is coming from accurate sources.

Violence in Media and Video Games: Does It
Matter?

Figure 8.7 One of the most popular video games, Grand Theft Auto, has frequently been at the center of debate
about gratuitous violence in the gaming world. (Photo courtesy of Meddy Garnet/flickr)
A glance through popular video game and movie titles geared toward children and teens shows the
vast spectrum of violence that is displayed, condoned, and acted out. It may hearken back to
Popeye and Bluto beating up on each other, or Wile E. Coyote trying to kill and devour the Road
Runner, but the graphics and actions have moved far beyond Acme’s cartoon dynamite.
As a way to guide parents in their programming choices, the motion picture industry put a
rating system in place in the 1960s. But new media—video games in particular—proved to be
uncharted territory. In 1994, the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ERSB) set a ratings system
for games that addressed issues of violence, sexuality, drug use, and the like. California took it a
step further by making it illegal to sell video games to underage buyers. The case led to a heated
debate about personal freedoms and child protection, and in 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled
against the California law, stating it violated freedom of speech (ProCon 2012).
Children’s play has often involved games of aggression—from cowboys and Indians, to cops
and robbers, to water-balloon fights. Many articles report on the controversy surrounding the
linkage between violent video games and violent behavior. Are these charges true? Psychologists
Anderson and Bushman (2001) reviewed 40-plus years of research on the subject and, in 2003,
determined that there are causal linkages between violent video game use and aggression. They
found that children who had just played a violent video game demonstrated an immediate increase
in hostile or aggressive thoughts, an increase in aggressive emotions, and physiological arousal
that increased the chances of acting out aggressive behavior (Anderson 2003).
Ultimately, repeated exposure to this kind of violence leads to increased expectations
regarding violence as a solution, increased violent behavioral scripts, and making violent behavior
more cognitively accessible (Anderson 2003). In short, people who play a lot of these games find
it easier to imagine and access violent solutions than nonviolent ones, and are less socialized to see
violence as a negative. While these facts do not mean there is no role for video games, it should
give players pause. Clearly, when it comes to violence in gaming, it’s not “only a game.”

CHAPTER 8 | MEDIA AND TECHNOLOGY

Product Advertising
Can You Hear Me Now? I’m Lovin’ It. The Verizon Halftime Report. Companies use advertising to sell
to us, but the way they reach us is changing. Increasingly, synergistic advertising practices ensure you
are receiving the same message from a variety of sources. For example, you may see billboards for
Miller on your way to a stadium, sit down to watch a game preceded by an MGD commercial on the big
screen, and watch a halftime ad in which people are frequently shown holding up the trademark bottles.
Chances are you can guess which brand of beer is for sale at the concession stand.
Advertising has changed, as technology and media have allowed consumers to bypass traditional
advertising venues. From the invention of the remote control, which allows us to ignore television
advertising without leaving our seats, to recording devices that let us watch television programs but
skip the ads, conventional advertising is on the wane. And print media is no different. Advertising
revenue in newspapers and on television fell significantly in 2009, showing that companies need new
ways of getting their message to consumers.
One model companies are considering to address this advertising downturn uses the same
philosophy as celebrity endorsements, just on a different scale. Companies are hiring college students to
be their on-campus representatives, looking for popular students involved in high-profile activities like
sports, fraternities, and music. The marketing team is betting that if we buy perfume because Beyoncé
tells us to, we’ll also choose our cell phone or smoothie if a popular student encourages that brand.
According to an article in the New York Times, fall semester 2011 saw an estimated 10,000 American
college students working on campus as brand ambassadors for products from Red Bull energy drinks to
Hewlett-Packard computers (Singer 2011). As the companies figure it, college students will trust one
source of information above all: other students.

Homogenization and Fragmentation
Despite the variety of media at hand, the mainstream news and entertainment you enjoy are
increasingly homogenized. Research by McManus (1995) suggests that different news outlets all tell
the same stories, using the same sources, resulting in the same message, presented with only slight
variations. So whether you are reading the New York Times or the CNN’s web site, the coverage of
national events like a major court case or political issue will likely be the same.
Simultaneous to this homogenization among the major news outlets, the opposite process is
occurring in the newer media streams. With so many choices, people increasingly “customize” their
news experience, minimizing “chance encounters” with information that does not jive with their
worldview (Prior 2005). For instance, those who are staunchly Republican can avoid centrist or liberalleaning cable news shows and web sites that would show Democrats in a favorable light. They know to
seek out Fox News over MSNBC, just as Democrats know to do the opposite. Further, people who want
to avoid politics completely can choose to visit web sites that deal only with entertainment or that will
keep them up to date on sports scores. They have an easy way to avoid information they do not wish to
hear.

CHAPTER 8 | MEDIA AND TECHNOLOGY

Technology, and increasingly media, has always driven globalization. Thomas Friedman (2005) in a
landmark publication, identified several ways in which technology “flattened” the globe and
contributed to our global economy. The first edition of The World Is Flat, written in 2005, posits that
core economic concepts were changed by personal computing and high-speed internet. Access to these
two technological shifts has allowed core-nation corporations to recruit workers in call centers located
in China or India. Using examples like a Midwestern American woman who runs a business from her
home via the call centers of Bangalore, India, Friedman warns that this new world order will exist
whether core-nation businesses are ready or not, and that in order to keep its key economic role in the
world, the United States will need to pay attention to how it prepares workers of the 21st century for
this dynamic.
Of course not everyone agrees with Friedman’s theory. Many economists pointed out that, in
reality, innovation, economic activity, and population still gather in geographically attractive areas,
continuing to create economic peaks and valleys, which are by no means flattened out to mean equality
for all. China’s hugely innovative and powerful cities of Shanghai and Beijing are worlds away from
the rural squalor of the country’s poorest denizens.
It is worth noting that Friedman is an economist, not a sociologist. His work focuses on the
economic gains and risks this new world order entails. In this section, we will look more closely at how
media globalization and technological globalization play out in a sociological perspective. As the
names suggest, media globalization is the worldwide integration of media through the cross-cultural
exchange of ideas, while technological globalization refers to the cross-cultural development and
exchange of technology.

Media Globalization
Lyons (2005) suggests that multinational corporations are the primary vehicle of media globalization,
and these corporations control global mass-media content and distribution (Compaine 2005). It is true,
when looking at who controls which media outlets, that there are fewer independent news sources as
larger and larger conglomerates develop. The United States offers about 1,500 newspapers, 2,600 book
publishers, and an equal number of television stations, plus 6,000 magazines and a whopping 10,000
radio outlets (Bagdikian 2004).
On the surface, there is endless opportunity to find diverse media outlets. But the numbers are
misleading. In 1983, a mere 50 corporations owned the bulk of mass-media outlets. Today, those 50
corporations have morphed into only six conglomerates (large companies consisting of many seemingly
unrelated businesses). These conglomerates control most of the United States’ mass-media vehicles.
These six corporations are Time Warner, Disney, Viacom, General Electric, and the foreignheadquartered News Corporation (Australia) and Bertelsmann (Germany). Because the readers of the
Daily News in one town might not care that their newspaper is owned by the same folks who own the
Tribune across the country, why does it matter? Monopolies matter because less competition typically
means consumers are less well served since dissenting opinions or diverse viewpoints are less likely to
be found.
While some social scientists predicted that the increase in media forms would create a global
village (McLuhan 1964), current research suggests that the public sphere accessing the global village
will tend to be rich, Caucasoid, and English-speaking (Jan 2009). As shown by the spring 2011
uprisings throughout the Arab world, technology really does offer a window into the news of the world.
For example, here in the United States we saw internet updates of Egyptian events in real time, with
people tweeting, posting, and blogging on the ground in Tahirir Square.
Still, there is no question that the exchange of technology from core nations to peripheral and
semi-peripheral ones leads to a number of complex issues. For instance, someone using a conflict
theorist approach might focus on how much political ideology and cultural colonialism occurs with
technological growth. In theory at least, technological innovations are ideology-free; a fiber optic cable
is the same in a Muslim country as a secular one, a communist country or a capitalist one. But those
who bring technology to less developed nations—whether they are nongovernment organizations,
businesses, or governments—usually have an agenda. A functionalist, in contrast, might focus on the
ways that technology creates new ways to share information about successful crop-growing programs,
or on the economic benefits of opening a new market for cell phone use. Either way, there are cultural
and societal assumptions and norms being delivered along with those high-speed wires.
Cultural and ideological bias are not the only risks of media globalization. In addition to the risk of
cultural imperialism and the loss of local culture, other problems come with the benefits of a more
interconnected globe. One risk is the potential censoring by national governments that let in only the
information and media they feel serves their message, as can be seen in China. In addition, core nations

CHAPTER 8 | MEDIA AND TECHNOLOGY

such as the United States risk the use of international media such as the internet to circumvent local
laws against socially deviant and dangerous behaviors such as gambling, child pornography, and the sex
trade. Offshore or international web sites allow U.S. citizens (as well as others) to seek out whatever
illegal (in the United States) or illicit information they want, from 24-hour online gambling sites that do
not require proof of age, to sites that sell child pornography. These examples illustrate the societal risks
of unfettered information flow.

China and the Internet: An Uncomfortable
Friendship

Figure 8.9 What information is accessible to these patrons of an internet café in China? What is censored from their
view? (Photo Courtesy of Kai Hendry/flickr)
In the United States, the internet is used to access illegal gambling and pornography sites, as well
as to research stocks, crowd-source what car to buy, or keep in touch with childhood friends. Can
we allow one or more of those activities, while restricting the rest? And who decides what needs
restricting? In a country with democratic principles and an underlying belief in free-market
capitalism, the answer is decided in the court system. But globally, the questions––and the
government’s responses––are very different.
China is in many ways the global poster child for the uncomfortable relationship between
internet freedom and government control. A country with a tight rein on the dissemination of
information, China has long worked to suppress what it calls “harmful information,” including
dissent concerning government politics, dialogue about China’s role in Tibet, or criticism of the
government’s handling of events.
With sites like Twitter, Facebook and YouTube blocked in China, the nation’s internet
users––some 500 million strong in 2011––turn to local media companies for their needs.
Renren.com is China’s answer to Facebook. Perhaps more importantly from a social-change
perspective, Sina Weibo is China’s version of Twitter. Microblogging, or weibo, acts like Twitter in
that users can post short messages that can be read by their subscribers. And because these services
move so quickly and with such wide scope, it is difficult for government overseers to keep up.
This tool was used to criticize government response to a deadly rail crash and to protest a chemical
plant. It was also credited with the government’s decision to report more accurately on the air
pollution in Beijing, which occurred after a high-profile campaign by a well-known property
developer (Pierson 2012).
There is no question of China’s authoritarian government ruling over this new form of
internet communication. The nation blocks the use of certain terms, such as human rights, and
passes new laws that require people to register with their real names, making it more dangerous to
criticize government actions. Indeed, 56-year-old microblogger Wang Lihong was recently
sentenced to nine months in prison for “stirring up trouble,” as her government described her work
helping people with government grievances (Bristow 2011). But the government cannot shut down

173

174

CHAPTER 8 | MEDIA AND TECHNOLOGY

this flow of information completely. Foreign companies, seeking to engage with the increasingly
important Chinese consumer market, have their own accounts: the NBA has more than 5 million
followers, and Tom Cruise’s Weibo account boasts almost 3 million followers (Zhang 2011). The
government, too, uses Weibo to get its own message across. As 2012 progresses, China’s approach
to social media and the freedoms it offers will be watched anxiously––on Sina Weibo and
beyond––by the rest of the world.

Technological Globalization
Technological globalization is impacted in large part by technological diffusion, the spread of
technology across borders. In the last two decades, there has been rapid improvement in the spread of
technology to peripheral and semi-peripheral nations, and a 2008 World Bank report discusses both the
benefits and ongoing challenges of this diffusion. In general, the report found that technological
progress and economic growth rates were linked, and that the rise in technological progress has helped
improve the situations of many living in absolute poverty (World Bank 2008). The report recognizes
that rural and low-tech products such as corn can benefit from new technological innovations, and that,
conversely, technologies like mobile banking can aid those whose rural existence consists of low-tech
market vending. In addition, technological advances in areas like mobile phones can lead to
competition, lowered prices, and concurrent improvements in related areas such as mobile banking and
information sharing.
However, the same patterns of social inequality that create a digital divide in the United States also
create digital divides in peripheral and semi-peripheral nations. While the growth of technology use
among countries has increased dramatically over the past several decades, the spread of technology
within countries is significantly slower among peripheral and semi-peripheral nations. In these
countries, far fewer people have the training and skills to take advantage of new technology, let alone
access it. Technological access tends to be clustered around urban areas, leaving out vast swaths of
peripheral-nation citizens. While the diffusion of information technologies has the potential to resolve
many global social problems, it is often the population most in need that is most affected by the digital
divide. For example, technology to purify water could save many lives, but the villages in peripheral
nations most in need of water purification don’t have access to the technology, the funds to purchase it,
or the technological comfort level to introduce it as a solution.

The Mighty Cell Phone: How Mobile Phones
Are Impacting Sub-Saharan Africa
In much of Africa’s poorest countries there is a marked lack of infrastructure. Bad roads, limited
electricity, minimal schools—the list goes on. Access to telephones has long been on that list. But
while landline access has not changed appreciably during the past 10 years, there’s been a marked
fivefold increase in mobile phone access; more than a third of people in Sub-Saharan Africa have
the ability to access a mobile phone (Katine 2010). Even more can access a “village phone”—a
shared phone program created by the Grameen Foundation. With access to mobile phone
technology, a host of benefits are available that have the potential to change the dynamics in these
poorest nations. Sometimes that change is as simple as being able to make a phone call to
neighboring market towns. By finding out which markets have vendors interested in their goods,
fishers and farmers can ensure they travel to the market that will serve them best, avoiding a
wasted trip. Others can use mobile phones and some of the emerging money-sending systems to
securely send money from one place to a family member or business partner elsewhere (Katine
2010).
These programs are often funded by businesses like Germany’s Vodafone or Britain’s
Masbabi, which hope to gain market share in the region. Phone giant Nokia points out that
worldwide there are 4 billion mobile phone users—that’s more than twice as many bank accounts
that exist—meaning there is ripe opportunity to connect banking companies with people who need
their services (ITU Telecom 2009). Not all access is corporate-based, however. Other programs are

CHAPTER 8 | MEDIA AND TECHNOLOGY

funded by business organizations that seek to help peripheral nations with tools for innovation and
entrepreneurship.
But this wave of innovation and potential business comes with costs. There is, certainly, the
risk of cultural imperialism, and the assumption that core nations (and core-nation multinationals)
know what is best for those struggling in the world’s poorest communities. Whether well
intentioned or not, the vision of a continent of Africans successfully chatting on their iPhone may
not be ideal. As with all aspects of global inequity, technology in Africa requires more than just
foreign investment. There must be a concerted effort to ensure the benefits of technology get to
where they are needed most.

8.4 Theoretical Perspectives on Media and
Technology
It is difficult to conceive of any one theory or theoretical perspective that can explain the variety of
ways that people interact with technology and the media. Technology runs the gamut from the match
you strike to light a candle all the way up to sophisticated nuclear power plants that might power the
factory where that candle, was made. Media could refer to the television you watch, the ads wrapping
the bus you take to work or school, or the magazines you flip through in a waiting room, not to mention
all the forms of new media, including Twitter, Facebook, blogs, YouTube, and the like. Are media and
technology critical to the forward march of humanity? Are they pernicious capitalist tools that lead to
the exploitation of workers worldwide? Are they the magic bullet the world has been waiting for to
level the playing field and raise the world’s poor out of extreme poverty? Choose any opinion and you
will find studies and scholars that agree with you––and those who disagree.

Functionalism
Because functionalism focuses on how media and technology contribute to the smooth functioning of
society, a good place to begin understanding this perspective is to write a list of functions you perceive
media and technology to perform. Your list might include the ability to find information on the internet,
television’s entertainment value, or how advertising and product placement contribute to social norms.
Commercial Function

water cooler-worthy than the game itself. (Photo courtesy of Dennis Yang/flickr)

CHAPTER 8 | MEDIA AND TECHNOLOGY

As you might guess, with nearly every U.S. household possessing a television, and the 250 billion hours
of television watched annually by Americans, companies that wish to connect with consumers find
television an irresistible platform to promote their goods and services (Nielsen 2012). Television
advertising is a highly functional way to meet a market demographic where it lives. Sponsors can use
the sophisticated data gathered by network and cable television companies regarding their viewers and
target their advertising accordingly. Whether you are watching cartoons on Nick Jr. or a cooking show
on Telemundo, chances are advertisers have a plan to reach you.
And it certainly doesn’t stop with television. Commercial advertising precedes movies in theaters
and shows up on and inside of public transportation, as well as on the sides of building and roadways.
Major corporations such as Coca-Cola bring their advertising into public schools, sponsoring sports
fields or tournaments, as well as filling the halls and cafeterias of those schools with vending machines
hawking their goods. With the rising concerns about childhood obesity and attendant diseases, the era
of soda machines in schools may be numbered. But not to worry. Coca-Cola’s filtered tap water,
Dasani, and its juice products will remain standards in many schools.
Entertainment Function
An obvious manifest function of media is its entertainment value. Most people, when asked why they
watch television or go to the movies, would answer that they enjoy it. And the numbers certainly
illustrate that. While 2012 Nielsen research shows a slight reduction of U.S. homes with televisions, the
reach of television is still vast. And the amount of time spent watching is equally large. Clearly,
enjoyment is paramount. On the technology side, as well, there is a clear entertainment factor to the use
of new innovations. From online gaming to chatting with friends on Facebook, technology offers new
and more exciting ways for people to entertain themselves.
Social Norm Functions
Even while the media is selling us goods and entertaining us, it also serves to socialize us, helping us
pass along norms, values, and beliefs to the next generation. In fact, we are socialized and resocialized
by media throughout our life course. All forms of media teach us what is good and desirable, how we
should speak, how we should behave, and how we should react to events. Media also provide us with
cultural touchstones during events of national significance. How many of your older relatives can recall
watching the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger on television? How many of those reading this
textbook followed the events of September 11 or Hurricane Katrina on the television or internet?
But debate exists over the extent and impact of media socialization. One recent study (Krahe et al.
2011) demonstrated that violent media content does have a desensitizing affect and is correlated with
aggressive thoughts. Another group of scholars (Gentile, Mathieson, and Crick 2011) found that among
children exposure to media violence led to an increase in both physical and relational aggression. Yet, a
meta-analysis study covering four decades of research (Savage 2003) could not establish a definitive
link between viewing violence and committing criminal violence.
It is clear from watching people emulate the styles of dress and talk that appear in media that
media has a socializing influence. What is not clear, despite nearly 50 years of empirical research, is
how much socializing influence the media has when compared to other agents of socialization, which
include any social institution that passes along norms, values, and beliefs (such as peers, family,
religious institutions, and the like).
Life-Changing Functions
Like media, many forms of technology do indeed entertain us, provide a venue for commercialization,
and socialize us. For example, some studies suggest the rising obesity rate is correlated with the
decrease in physical activity caused by an increase in use of some forms of technology, a latent function
of the prevalence of media in society (Kautiainen et al. 2011). Without a doubt, a manifest function of
technology is to change our lives, sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse. Think of how
the digital age has improved the ways we communicate. Have you ever used Skype or another webcast
to talk to a friend or family member far away? Or maybe you have organized a fund drive, raising
thousands of dollars, all from your desk chair.
Of course, the downside to this ongoing information flow is the near impossibility of
disconnecting from technology, leading to an expectation of constant convenient access to information
and people. Such a fast-paced dynamic is not always to our benefit. Some sociologists assert that this
level of media exposure leads to narcotizing dysfunction, a term that describes when people are too
overwhelmed with media input to really care about the issue, so their involvement becomes defined by
awareness instead of by action about the issue at hand (Lazerfeld and Merton 1948).

CHAPTER 8 | MEDIA AND TECHNOLOGY

Conflict Perspective
In contrast to theories in the functional perspective, the conflict perspective focuses on the creation and
reproduction of inequality—social processes that tend to disrupt society rather than contribute to its
smooth operation. When taking a conflict perspective, one major focus is the differential access to
media and technology embodied in the digital divide. Conflict theorists also look at who controls the
media, and how media promotes the norms of upper-middle-class white Americans while minimizing
the presence of the lower class, especially people of color.
Control of Media and Technology
Powerful individuals and social institutions have a great deal of influence over which forms of
technology are released, when and where they are released, and what kind of media is available for our
consumption, a form of gatekeeping. Shoemaker and Voss (2009) define gatekeeping as the sorting
process by which thousands of possible messages are shaped into a mass media-appropriate form and
reduced to a manageable amount. In other words, the people in charge of the media decide what the
public is exposed to, which, as C. Wright Mills (1956) famously noted, is the heart of media’s power.
Take a moment to think of the way that “new media” evolves and replaces traditional forms of
hegemonic media. With a hegemonic media, culturally diverse society can be dominated by one race,
gender, or class through the manipulation of the media imposing its worldview as a societal norm. New
media renders the gatekeeper role less of a factor in information distribution. Popular sites such as
YouTube and Facebook engage in a form of self-policing. Users are encouraged to report inappropriate
behavior that moderators will then address.
In addition, some conflict theorists suggest that the way American media is generated results in an
unbalanced political arena. Those with the most money can buy the most media exposure, run smear
campaigns against their competitors, and maximize their visual presence. Almost a year before the 2012
U.S. presidential election, the candidates––Barack Obama for the Democrats and numerous Republican
contenders––have raised more than $186 million (Carmi et al. 2012). What do you think a conflict
perspective theorist would suggest about the potential for the non-rich to be heard in politics?
Technological Social Control and Digital Surveillance
Social scientists take the idea of the surveillance society so seriously that there is an entire journal
devoted to its study, Surveillance and Society. The panoptic surveillance envisioned by Jeremy
Bentham and later analyzed by Michel Foucault (1975) is increasingly realized in the form of
technology used to monitor our every move. This surveillance was imagined as a form of constant
monitoring in which the observation posts are decentralized and the observed is never communicated
with directly. Today, digital security cameras capture our movements, observers can track us through
our cell phones, and police forces around the world use facial-recognition software.

CHAPTER 8 | MEDIA AND TECHNOLOGY

Feminist Perspective

Figure 8.11 What types of women are we exposed to in the media? Some would argue that the range of female images is
misleadingly narrow. (Photo courtesy of Cliff1066/flickr)

Take a look at popular television shows, advertising campaigns, and online game sites. In most, women
are portrayed in a particular set of parameters and tend to have a uniform look that society recognizes as
attractive. Most are thin, white or light-skinned, beautiful, and young. Why does this matter? Feminist
perspective theorists believe it’s crucial in creating and reinforcing stereotypes. For example, Fox and
Bailenson (2009) found that online female avatars (the characters you play in online games like World
of Warcraft or Second Life) conforming to gender stereotypes enhances negative attitudes toward
women, and Brasted (2010) found that media (advertising in particular) promotes gender stereotypes.
The gender gap in tech-related fields (science, technology, engineering, and math) is no secret. A
2011 U.S. Department of Commerce Report suggested that gender stereotyping is one reason for this
gap, acknowledging the bias toward men as keepers of technological knowledge (US Department of
Commerce 2011). But gender stereotypes go far beyond the use of technology. Press coverage in the
media reinforces stereotypes that subordinate women, giving airtime to looks over skills, and
disparaging women who defy accepted norms.
Recent research in new media has offered a mixed picture of its potential to equalize the status of
men and women in the arenas of technology and public discourse. A European agency, the Advisory
Committee on Equal Opportunities for Men and Women (2010), issued an opinion report suggesting
that while there is the potential for new media forms to perpetuate gender stereotypes and the gender
gap in technology and media access, at the same time new media could offer alternative forums for
feminist groups and the exchange of feminist ideas. Still, the committee warned against the relatively
unregulated environment of new media and the potential for antifeminist activities, from pornography
to human trafficking, to flourish there.
Increasingly prominent in the discussion of new media and feminism is cyberfeminism, the
application to, and promotion of, feminism online. Research on cyberfeminism runs the gamut from the
liberating use of blogs by women living in Iraq during the second Gulf War (Peirce 2011) to an
investigation of the Suicide Girls web site (Magnet 2007).

Symbolic Interactionism
Technology itself may act as a symbol for many. The kind of computer you own, the kind of car you
drive, whether or not you can afford the latest Apple product—these serve as a social indicator of
wealth and status. Neo-Luddites are people who see technology as symbolizing the coldness and
alienation of modern life. But for technophiles, technology symbolizes the potential for a brighter
future. For those adopting an ideological middle ground, technology might symbolize status (in the
form of a massive flat-screen television) or failure (in owning a basic old mobile phone with no bells or
whistles).

CHAPTER 8 | MEDIA AND TECHNOLOGY

Social Construction of Reality
Meanwhile, media create and spread symbols that become the basis for our shared understanding of
society. Theorists working in the interactionist perspective focus on this social construction of reality,
an ongoing process in which people subjectively create and understand reality. Media constructs our
reality in a number of ways. For some, the people they watch on a screen can become a primary group,
meaning the small informal groups of people who are closest to them. For many others, media becomes
a reference group: a group that influences an individual and to which an individual compares himself,
and by which we judge our successes and failures. We might do very well without an Android
smartphone, until we see characters using it on our favorite television show or our classmates whipping
one out between classes.
While media may indeed be the medium to spread the message of the rich white males, Gamson,
Croteau, Hoynes, and Sasson (1992) point out that some forms of media discourse allow the appearance
of competing constructions of reality. For example, advertisers find new and creative ways to sell us
products we don’t need and probably wouldn’t want without their prompting, but some networking sites
such as Freecycle offer a commercial-free way of requesting and trading items that would otherwise be
discarded. Additionally, the web is full of blogs chronicling lives lived “off the grid,” or without
participation in the commercial economy.
Social Networking and Social Construction
While Twitter and Facebook encourage us to check in and provide details of our day through online
social networks, corporations can just as easily promote their products on these sites. Even supposedly
crowd-sourced sites like Yelp (which aggregates local reviews) are not immune to corporate
shenanigans. That is, we think we are reading objective observations when in reality we may be buying
into one more form of advertising.
Facebook, which started as a free social network for college students, is increasingly a monetized
business, selling you goods and services in subtle ways. But chances are you don’t think of Facebook as
one big online advertisement. What started out as a symbol of coolness and insider status, unavailable
and inaccessible to parents and corporate shills, now promotes consumerism in the form of games and
fandom. For example, think of all the money spent to upgrade popular Facebook games like Farmville.
And notice that whenever you become a “fan,” you likely receive product updates and special deals that
promote online and real -world consumerism. It is unlikely that millions of people want to be “friends”
with Pampers. But if it means a weekly coupon, they will, in essence, rent out space on their Facebook
page for Pampers to appear. Thus, we develop both new ways to spend money and brand loyalties that
will last even after Facebook is considered outdated and obsolete.

Section Summary
8.1 Technology Today
Technology is the application of science to address the problems of daily life. The fast pace of
technological advancement means the advancements are continuous, but that not everyone has equal
access. The gap created by this unequal access has been termed the digital divide. The knowledge gap
refers to an effect of the digital divide: the lack of knowledge or information that keeps those who were
not exposed to technology from gaining marketable skills

8.2 Media and Technology in Society
Media and technology have been interwoven from the earliest days of human communication. The
printing press, the telegraph, and the internet are all examples of their intersection. Mass media has
allowed for more shared social experiences, but new media now creates a seemingly endless amount of
airtime for any and every voice that wants to be heard. Advertising has also changed with technology.
New media allows consumers to bypass traditional advertising venues, causing companies to be more
innovative and intrusive as they try to gain our attention.

8.3 Global Implications
Technology drives globalization, but what that means can be hard to decipher. While some economists
see technological advances leading to a more level playing field where anyone anywhere can be a
global contender, the reality is that opportunity still clusters in geographically advantaged areas. Still,
technological diffusion has led to the spread of more and more technology across borders into
peripheral and semi-peripheral nations. However, true technological global equality is a long way off.

8.4 Theoretical Perspectives on Media and Technology
There are myriad theories about how society, technology, and media will progress. Functionalism sees
the contribution that technology and media provide to the stability of society, from facilitating leisure
time to increasing productivity. Conflict theorists are more concerned with how technology reinforces
inequalities among communities, both within and among countries. They also look at how media
typically give voice to the most powerful, and how new media might offer tools to help those who are
disenfranchised. Symbolic interactionists see the symbolic uses of technology as signs of everything
from a sterile futuristic world to a successful professional life.

CHAPTER 9 | SOCIAL STRATIFICATION IN THE UNITED STATES

Introduction to Social Stratification in the United
States
Robert and Joan have spent their entire lives in Cudahy, Wisconsin, a small town of about 18,000. The
high school sweethearts got married after graduation and later bought a house. After Robert served two
years in the Army, he came home and accepted a job in a foundry, working on machinery and
equipment. Joan worked as a hotel receptionist until she quit her job to raise their two children, Michael
and Lisa.
Robert and Joan worked hard to make sure their kids had good lives. The kids went to Cudahy
High School, like their parents, and took part in many extracurricular activities. Michael played football
and Lisa participated in the debate team and Spanish Club, and served as class vice president.
After high school, Michael’s and Lisa’s lives took two divergent paths. Michael stayed close to
home, earning a degree in hotel management at a community college. He began working the front desk
of a downtown Milwaukee hotel, a job similar to the one his mother held so long ago. He married
Donna, a high school classmate who now worked in a day-care center. The couple bought a house two
miles from his parents and eventually had three children of their own.
Lisa’s experiences, meanwhile, took her from place to place. She double-majored in psychology
and social work at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, then was accepted to the University of
California-Berkeley, where she earned her master’s and doctoral degrees in Social Welfare. She worked
as a teaching assistant and helped organize a summit on institutional racism. Lisa received a grant to
start a Hispanic youth program in Denver, Colorado. There, she met Mario, a cook, and helped him
learn English. The couple soon got married and moved into an apartment in a poor section of the city.
They had a daughter, Alaina.
Soon after, Lisa accepted an assistant professorship at the University of Colorado. That summer,
while visiting her hometown of Cudahy, Lisa revealed some surprising news to her parents. She
explained that she, Mario, and Alaina, were moving to Torreón, Mexico, to be close to Mario’s family.
Lisa would do research for a book proposal she’d written and guest lectured at the nearby university.
They planned to return in two or three years, in time for Alaina to start school in the United States.
Robert and Joan were proud of their children. Michael and Lisa both had happy marriages, healthy
children, and secure jobs. However, Robert and Joan puzzled over the different life paths their children
took. Michael married a local woman, worked in the area, and stayed close with family and friends.
Lisa moved far from home, married a foreigner, was fluent in two languages, and wanted to live in a
foreign country. Joan and Robert had trouble understanding their daughter’s choices. Michael was a
chip off the old block, while Lisa seemed like a stranger.

9.1 What Is Social Stratification?

decisions and earn the most money. The majority of Americans will never see the view from the top. (Photo courtesy of Alex

CHAPTER 9 | SOCIAL STRATIFICATION IN THE UNITED STATES

In the opening story, two siblings chose different life paths. Michael stayed within his parents’ social
realm, achieving similar levels of education, occupation, and income. He retained social ties with
community members. Lisa, however, rose from her parents’ social position, achieving higher levels of
education, occupation, and income. She broke old social ties and formed new ties, disregarding barriers
and norms of race, gender, and class. Despite their different paths, both siblings were influenced by the
social position of their parents. What determines a person’s social standing? And how does social
standing direct or limit a person’s choices?
Sociologists use the term social stratification to describe the system of social standing. Social
stratification refers to a society’s categorization of its people into rankings of socioeconomic tiers
based on factors like wealth, income, race, education, and power.
You may remember the word “stratification” from geology class. The distinct vertical layers found
in rock, called stratification, are a good way to visualize social structure. Society’s layers are made of
people, and society’s resources are distributed unevenly throughout the layers. The people who have
more resources represent the top layer of the social structure of stratification. Other groups of people,
with progressively fewer and fewer resources, represent the lower layers of our society.

Figure 9.3 Strata in rock illustrate social stratification. People are sorted, or layered, into social categories. Many factors
determine a person’s social standing, such as income, education, occupation, as well as age, race, gender, and even physical
abilities. (Photo courtesy of Just a Prairie Boy/flickr)
In the United States, people like to believe everyone has an equal chance at success. To a certain
extent, Michael and Lisa illustrate the belief that hard work and talent—not prejudicial treatment or
societal values—determine social rank. This emphasis on self-effort perpetuates the belief that people
control their own social standing.
However, sociologists recognize that social stratification is a society-wide system that makes
inequalities apparent. While there are always inequalities between individuals, sociologists are
interested in larger social patterns. Stratification is not about individual inequalities, but about
systematic inequalities based on group membership, classes, and the like. No individual, rich or poor,
can be blamed for social inequalities. A person’s social standing is affected by the structure of society.
Although individuals may support or fight inequalities, social stratification is created and supported by
society as a whole.

CHAPTER 9 | SOCIAL STRATIFICATION IN THE UNITED STATES

Figure 9.4 The people who live in these houses most likely share similar levels of income and education. Neighborhoods
often house people of the same social standing. Wealthy families do not typically live next door to poorer families, though this
varies depending on the particular city and country. (Photo courtesy of Orin Zebest/flickr)
Factors that define stratification vary in different societies. In most societies, stratification is an
economic system, based on wealth, the net value of money and assets a person has, and income, a
person’s wages or investment dividends. While people are regularly categorized based on how rich or
poor they are, other important factors influence social standing. For example, in some cultures, wisdom
and charisma are valued, and people who have them are revered more than those who don’t. In some
cultures, the elderly are esteemed; in others, the elderly are disparaged or overlooked. Societies’
cultural beliefs often reinforce the inequalities of stratification.
One key determinant of social standing is the social standing of one’s parents. Parents tend to pass
their social position on to their children. People inherit not only social standing but also the cultural
norms that accompany a certain lifestyle. They share these with a network of friends and family
members. Social standing becomes a comfort zone, a familiar lifestyle, and an identity.
Other determinants are found in a society’s occupational structure. Teachers, for example, often
have high levels of education but receive relatively low pay. Many believe that teaching is a noble
profession, so teachers should do their jobs for love of their profession and the good of their students,
not for money. Yet no successful executive or entrepreneur would embrace that attitude in the business
world, where profits are valued as a driving force. Cultural attitudes and beliefs like these support and
perpetuate social inequalities.

Systems of Stratification
Sociologists distinguish between two types of systems of stratification. Closed systems accommodate
little change in social position. They do not allow people to shift levels and do not permit social
relations between levels. Open systems, which are based on achievement, allow movement and
interaction between layers and classes. Different systems reflect, emphasize, and foster certain cultural
values, and shape individual beliefs. Stratification systems include class systems and caste systems, as
well as meritocracy.

CHAPTER 9 | SOCIAL STRATIFICATION IN THE UNITED STATES

The Caste System

Figure 9.5 India used to have a rigid caste system. The people in the lowest caste suffered from extreme poverty and were
shunned by society. Some aspects of India’s defunct caste system remain socially relevant. In this photo, an Indian woman of a
specific Hindu caste works in construction, demolishing and building houses. (Photo courtesy of Elessar/flickr)
Caste systems are closed stratification systems in which people can do little or nothing to change their
social standing. A caste system is one in which people are born into their social standing and will
remain in it their whole lives. People are assigned occupations regardless of their talents, interests, or
potential. There are virtually no opportunities to improve one’s social position.
In the Hindu caste tradition, people were expected to work in the occupation of their caste and to
enter into marriage according to their caste. Accepting this social standing was considered a moral duty.
Cultural values reinforced the system. Caste systems promote beliefs in fate, destiny, and the will of a
higher power, rather than promoting individual freedom as a value. A person who lived in a caste
society was socialized to accept his or her social standing.
Although the caste system in India has been officially dismantled, its residual presence in Indian
society is deeply embedded. In rural areas, aspects of the tradition are more likely to remain, while
urban centers show less evidence of this past. In India’s larger cities, people now have more
opportunities to choose their own career paths and marriage partners. As a global center of
employment, corporations have introduced merit-based hiring and employment to the nation.
The Class System
A class system is based on both social factors and individual achievement. A class consists of a set of
people who share similar status with regard to factors like wealth, income, education, and occupation.
Unlike caste systems, class systems are open. People are free to gain a different level of education or
employment than their parents. They can also socialize with and marry members of other classes,
allowing people to move from one class to another.
In a class system, occupation is not fixed at birth. Though family and other societal models help
guide a person toward a career, personal choice plays a role. Michael, the sibling in the chapter
opening, chose a career similar to that of his parents. His sister Lisa chose a career based on individual
interests that differed from her parents’ social class.
In class systems, people have the option to form exogamous marriages, unions of spouses from
different social categories. Marriage in these circumstances is based on values such as love and
compatibility rather than on social standing or economics. Though social conformities still exist that
encourage people to choose partners within their own class, people are not as pressured to choose
marriage partners based solely on those elements. For example, although Michael formed an
endogamous union, marrying a partner from his same social background, Lisa formed an exogamous
union, marrying someone outside her social categories.
Meritocracy
Meritocracy is another system of social stratification in which personal effort—or merit—determines
social standing. High levels of effort will lead to a high social position, and vice versa. The concept of
meritocracy is an ideal—that is, a society has never existed where social rank was based purely on
merit. Because of the complex structure of societies, processes like socialization, and the realities of
economic systems, social standing is influenced by multiple factors, not merit alone. Inheritance and

193

194

CHAPTER 9 | SOCIAL STRATIFICATION IN THE UNITED STATES

pressure to conform to norms, for instance, disrupt the notion of a pure meritocracy. Sociologists see
aspects of meritocracies in modern societies when they study the role of academic performance and job
performance, and the systems in place for evaluating and rewarding achievement in these areas.

Status Consistency
Social stratification systems determine social position based on factors like income, education, and
occupation. Sociologists use the term status consistency to describe the consistency, or lack thereof, of
an individual’s rank across these factors. Caste systems correlate with high status consistency, whereas
the more flexible class system has lower status consistency.
To illustrate, let’s consider Susan. Susan earned her high school degree but did not go on to
college. That factor is a trait of the lower-middle class. She began doing landscaping work, which, as
manual labor, is also a trait of lower-middle or even lower class. However, over time, Susan started her
own company. She hired employees. She won larger contracts. She became a business owner and
earned a lot of money. Those traits represent the upper-middle class. Here there are inconsistencies
between Susan’s educational level, her occupation, and her income. In a class system, a person can
work hard and have little education and still be in middle or upper class, whereas in a caste system that
would not be possible. In a class system, low status consistency correlates with having more choices
and opportunities.

Careers in Sociology

The Commoner Who Could Be Queen

Figure 9.6 Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, who is in line to be king of England, married Catherine Middleton, a
so-called commoner, meaning she does not have royal ancestry. (Photo courtesy of humberpike/flickr)
On April 29, 2011, in London, England, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, married Catherine
Middleton, a commoner. It is rare, though not unheard of, for a member of the British royal family
to marry a commoner. Kate Middleton had a middle-class upbringing. Her father was a former
flight dispatcher and her mother a former flight attendant. Kate and William met when they were
both students at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland (Köhler 2010).
Britain’s monarchy arose during the Middle Ages. Its social hierarchy placed royalty at the
top and commoners on the bottom. This was generally a closed system, with people born into
positions of nobility. Wealth was passed from generation to generation through primogeniture, a
law stating that all property would be inherited by the firstborn son. If the family had no son, the

CHAPTER 9 | SOCIAL STRATIFICATION IN THE UNITED STATES

land went to the next closest male relation. Women could not inherit property and their social
standing was primarily determined through marriage.
The arrival of the Industrial Revolution changed Britain’s social structure. Commoners
moved to cities, got jobs, and made better livings. Gradually, people found new opportunities to
increase their wealth and power. Today, the government is a constitutional monarchy with the
prime minister and other ministers elected to their positions, and with the royal family’s role being
largely ceremonial. The long-ago differences between nobility and commoners have blurred, and
the modern class system in Britain is similar to that of the United States (McKee 1996).
Today, the royal family still commands wealth, power, and a great deal of attention. When
Queen Elizabeth II retires or passes away, Prince Charles will be first in line to ascend the throne.
If he abdicates (chooses not to become king) or dies, the position will go to Prince William. If that
happens, Kate Middleton will be called Queen Catherine and hold the position of queen consort.
She will be one of the few queens in history to have earned a college degree (Marquand 2011).
There is a great deal of social pressure on her not only to behave as a royal but to bear
children. The royal family recently changed its succession laws to allow daughters, not just sons,
to ascend the throne. Kate’s experience—from commoner to possible queen—demonstrates the
fluidity of social position in modern society.

9.2 Social Stratification and Mobility in the
United States
Most sociologists define social class as a grouping based on similar social factors like wealth, income,
education, and occupation. These factors affect how much power and prestige a person has. Social
stratification reflects an unequal distribution of resources. In most cases, having more money means
having more power or more opportunities. Stratification can also result from physical and intellectual
traits. Categories that affect social standing include family ancestry, race, ethnicity, age, and gender. In
the United States, standing can also be defined by characteristics such as IQ, athletic abilities,
appearance, personal skills, and achievements.

Standard of Living
In the last century, the United States has seen a steady rise in its standard of living, the level of wealth
available to a certain socioeconomic class in order to acquire the material necessities and comforts to
maintain its lifestyle. The standard of living is based on factors such as income, employment, class,
poverty rates, and affordability of housing. Because standard of living is closely related to quality of
life, it can represent factors such as the ability to afford a home, own a car, and take vacations.
In the United States, a small portion of the population has the means to the highest standard of
living. A Federal Reserve Bank study in 2009 showed that a mere one percent of the population holds
one third of our nation’s wealth (Kennickell 2009). Wealthy people receive the most schooling, have
better health, and consume the most goods and services. Wealthy people also wield decision-making
power. Many people think of the United States as a “middle-class society.” They think a few people are
rich, a few are poor, and most are pretty well off, existing in the middle of the social strata. But as the
study above indicates, there is not an even distribution of wealth. Millions of women and men struggle
to pay rent, buy food, find work, and afford basic medical care.
In the United States, as in most high-income nations, social stratifications and standards of living
are in part based on occupation (Lin and Xie 1988). Aside from the obvious impact that income has on
someone’s standard of living, occupations also influence social standing through the relative levels of
prestige they afford. Employment in medicine, law, or engineering confers high status. Teachers and
police officers are generally respected, though not considered particularly prestigious. On the other end
of the scale, some of the lowest rankings apply to positions like waitress, janitor, and bus driver.

CHAPTER 9 | SOCIAL STRATIFICATION IN THE UNITED STATES

Social Classes in the United States

Figure 9.7 Does taste or fashion sense indicate class? Is there any way to tell if this young man comes from an upper,
middle, or lower class background? (Photo courtesy of Kelly Bailey/flickr)
Does a person’s appearance indicate class? Can you tell a man’s education level based on his clothing?
Do you know a woman’s income by the car she drives? There may have been a time in the United
States when people’s class was more visibly apparent. Today, however, it is harder to determine class.
For sociologists, too, categorizing class is a fluid science. Sociologists general identify three levels
of class in the United States: upper, middle, and lower class. Within each class, there are many
subcategories. Wealth is the most significant way of distinguishing classes, because wealth can be
transferred to one’s children, perpetuating the class structure. One economist, J.D. Foster, defines the 20
percent of America’s highest earners as “upper income,” and the lower 20 percent as “lower income.”
The remaining 60 percent of the population make up the middle class. But by that distinction, annual
household incomes for the middle class range between $25,000 and $100,000 (Mason and Sullivan
2010). How can a person earning $25,000 a year have the same standing as someone earning $100,000
a year—four times as much?
One sociological perspective distinguishes the classes, in part, according to their relative power
and control over their lives. The upper class not only have power and control over their own lives, their
social status gives them power and control over others’ lives as well. The middle class don’t generally
control other strata of society, but they do exert control over their own lives. In contrast, the lower class
has little control over their work or lives. Below, we will explore the major divisions of American social
class and their key subcategories.
Upper Class

Figure 9.8 Members of the upper class can afford to live, work, and play in exclusive places designed for luxury and
comfort. (Photo courtesy of PrimeImageMedia.com/flickr)
The upper class is considered America’s top, and only the powerful elite get to see the view from there.
In the United States, people with extreme wealth make up one percent of the population, and they own
one-third of the country’s wealth (Beeghley 2008).
Money provides not just access to material goods, but also access to power. America’s upper class
wields a lot of power. As corporate leaders, their decisions affect the job status of millions of people. As

CHAPTER 9 | SOCIAL STRATIFICATION IN THE UNITED STATES

media owners, they shape the collective identity of the nation. They run the major network television
stations, radio broadcasts, newspapers, magazines, publishing houses, and sports franchises. As board
members of the most influential colleges and universities, they shape cultural attitudes and values. As
philanthropists, they establish foundations to support social causes they believe in. As campaign
contributors, they influence politicians and fund campaigns, sometimes to protect their own economic
interests.
American society has historically distinguished between “old money” (inherited wealth passed
from one generation to the next) and “new money” (wealth you have earned and built yourself). While
both types may have equal net worth, they have traditionally held different social standing. People of
old money, firmly situated in the upper class for generations, have held high prestige. Their families
have socialized them to know the customs, norms, and expectations that come with wealth. Often, the
very wealthy don’t work for wages. Some study business or become lawyers in order to manage the
family fortune. Others, such as Paris Hilton, capitalize on being a rich socialite and transform that into
celebrity status, flaunting a wealthy lifestyle.
However, new money members of the upper class are not oriented to the customs and mores of the
elite. They haven’t gone to the most exclusive schools. They have not established old-money social ties.
People with new money might flaunt their wealth, buying sports cars and mansions, but they might still
exhibit behaviors attributed to the middle and lower classes.
The Middle Class

Figure 9.9 These members of a club likely consider themselves middle class. (Photo courtesy of United Way CanadaCentraide Canada/flickr)
Many people call themselves middle class, but there are differing ideas about what that means. People
with annual incomes of $150,000 call themselves middle class, as do people who annually earn
$30,000. That helps explain why, in the United States, the middle class is broken into upper and lower
subcategories.
Upper-middle-class people tend to hold bachelor’s and postgraduate degrees. They’ve studied
subjects such as business, management, law, or medicine. Lower-middle-class members hold bachelor’s
degrees or associate’s degrees from two-year community or technical colleges.
Comfort is a key concept to the middle class. Middle-class people work hard and live fairly
comfortable lives. Upper-middle-class people tend to pursue careers that earn comfortable incomes.
They provide their families with large homes and nice cars. They may go skiing or boating on vacation.
Their children receive quality education and health care (Gilbert 2010).
In the lower middle class, people hold jobs supervised by members of the upper middle class.
They fill technical, lower-level management, or administrative support positions. Compared to lowerclass work, lower-middle-class jobs carry more prestige and come with slightly higher paychecks. With
these incomes, people can afford a decent, mainstream lifestyle, but they struggle to maintain it. They
generally don’t have enough income to build significant savings. In addition, their grip on class status is
more precarious than in the upper tiers of the class system. When budgets are tight, lower-middle-class
people are often the ones to lose their jobs.

CHAPTER 9 | SOCIAL STRATIFICATION IN THE UNITED STATES

The Lower Class

Figure 9.10 This man is a custodian at a restaurant. His job, which is crucial to the business, is considered lower class.
(Photo courtesy of Frederick Md Publicity/flickr)

The lower class is also referred to as the working class. Just like the middle and upper classes, the lower
class can be divided into subsets: the working class, the working poor, and the underclass. Compared to
the lower middle class, lower-class people have less of an educational background and earn smaller
incomes. They work jobs that require little prior skill or experience, often doing routine tasks under
close supervision.
Working-class people, the highest subcategory of the lower class, often land decent jobs in fields
like custodial or food service. The work is hands-on and often physically demanding, such as
landscaping, cooking, cleaning, or building.
Beneath the working class is the working poor. Like the working class, they have unskilled, lowpaying employment. However, their jobs rarely offer benefits such as healthcare or retirement planning,
and their positions are often seasonal or temporary. They work as sharecroppers, migrant farm workers,
housecleaners, and day laborers. Some are high school dropouts. Some are illiterate, unable to read job
ads. Many do not vote because they do not believe that any politician will help change their situation
(Beeghley 2008).
How can people work full time and still be poor? Even working full time, millions of the working
poor earn incomes too meager to support a family. Minimum wage varies from state to state, but in
many states it is $7.25 (Department of Labor 2011). At that rate, working 40 hours a week earns $290.
That comes to $15,080 a year, before tax and deductions. Even for a single person, the pay is low. A
married couple with children will have a hard time covering expenses.
The underclass is America’s lowest tier. Members of the underclass live mainly in inner cities.
Many are unemployed or underemployed. Those who do hold jobs typically perform menial tasks for
little pay. Some of the underclass are homeless. For many, welfare systems provide a much-needed
support through food assistance, medical care, housing, and the like.

Social Mobility
Social mobility refers to the ability to change positions within a social stratification system. When
people improve or diminish their economic status in a way that affects social class, they experience
social mobility.
Upward mobility refers to an increase—or upward shift—in social class. In the United States,
people applaud the rags-to-riches achievements of celebrities like Jennifer Lopez or Michael Jordan.
Bestselling author Stephen King worked as a janitor prior to being published. Oprah Winfrey grew up
in poverty in rural Mississippi before becoming a powerful media personality. There are many stories of
people rising from modest beginnings to fame and fortune. But the truth is that relative to the overall
population, the number of people who launch from poverty to wealth is very small. Still, upward
mobility is not only about becoming rich and famous. In the United States, people who earn a college
degree, get a job promotion, or marry someone with a good income may move up socially.
Downward mobility indicates a lowering of one’s social class. Some people move downward
because of business setbacks, unemployment, or illness. Dropping out of school, losing a job, or
becoming divorced may result in a loss of income or status and, therefore, downward social mobility.
Intergenerational mobility explains a difference in social class between different generations of a
family. For example, an upper-class executive may have parents who belonged to the middle class. In

CHAPTER 9 | SOCIAL STRATIFICATION IN THE UNITED STATES

turn, those parents may have been raised in the lower class. Patterns of intergenerational mobility can
reflect long-term societal changes.
Intragenerational mobility describes a difference in social class that between different members
of the same generation. For example, the wealth and prestige experienced by one person may be quite
different from that of his or her siblings.
Structural mobility happens when societal changes enable a whole group of people to move up or
down the social class ladder. Structural mobility is attributable to changes in society as a whole, not
individual changes. In the first half of the 20th century, industrialization expanded the U.S. economy,
raising the standard of living and leading to upward structural mobility. In today’s work economy, the
recession and the outsourcing of jobs overseas have contributed to high unemployment rates. Many
people have experienced economic setbacks, creating a wave of downward structural mobility.
Many Americans believe that people move up in class because of individual efforts and move
down by their own doing. In the example of the siblings Michael and Lisa, Lisa may have had more
intelligence, drive, and ambition than her brother. She may have worked harder. However, Lisa’s story
can also be explained in the context of structural mobility. Lisa grew up during a time of expanding
opportunities for women, opportunities that were not so readily available to her mother. She may have
felt encouraged by her college mentors to pursue a higher degree, and she may have felt rewarded when
she did so. If Michael and Lisa had grown up in an earlier era, their life paths may have been
completely different.
When analyzing the trends and movements in social mobility, sociologists consider all modes of
mobility. Scholars recognize that mobility is not as common or easy to achieve as many people think. In
fact, some consider social mobility a myth.

Class Traits
Class traits, also called class markers, are the typical behaviors, customs, and norms that define each
class. Class traits indicate the level of exposure a person has to a wide range of cultures. Class traits
also indicate the amount of resources a person has to spend on items like hobbies, vacations, and leisure
activities.
People may associate the upper class with enjoyment of costly, refined, or highly cultivated
tastes—expensive clothing, luxury cars, high-end fund-raisers, and opulent vacations. People may also
believe that the middle and lower classes are more likely to enjoy camping, fishing, or hunting,
shopping at large retailers, and participating in community activities. It is important to note that while
these descriptions may be class traits, they may also simply be stereotypes. Moreover, just as class
distinctions have blurred in recent decades, so too have class traits. A very wealthy person may enjoy
bowling as much as opera. A factory worker could be a skilled French cook. A billionaire might dress
in ripped jeans, and a low-income student might own designer shoes.
These days, individual taste does not necessarily follow class lines. Still, you are not likely to see
someone driving a Mercedes living in an inner-city neighborhood. And most likely, a resident of a
wealthy gated community will not be riding a bicycle to work. Class traits often develop based on
cultural behaviors that stem from the resources available within each class.

Turn-of-the-Century “Social Problem Novels”:
Sociological Gold Mines
Class distinctions were sharper in the 19th century and earlier, in part because people easily
accepted them. The ideology of social order made class structure seem natural, right, and just.
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, American and British novelists played a role in
changing public perception. They published novels in which characters struggled to survive
against a merciless class system. These dissenting authors used gender and morality to question
the class system and expose its inequalities. They protested the suffering of urbanization and
industrialization, drawing attention to these issues.

199

200

CHAPTER 9 | SOCIAL STRATIFICATION IN THE UNITED STATES

These “social problem novels,” sometimes called Victorian realism, forced middle-class
readers into an uncomfortable position: they had to question and challenge the natural order of
social class.
For speaking out so strongly about the social issues of class, authors were both praised and
criticized. Most authors did not want to dissolve the class system. They wanted to bring about an
awareness that would improve conditions for the lower classes, while maintaining their own higher
class positions (DeVine 2005).
Soon, middle-class readers were not their only audience. In 1870, Forster’s Elementary
Education Act required all children ages 5 through 12 in England and Wales to attend school. The
act increased literacy levels among the urban poor, causing a rise in sales of cheap newspapers and
magazines. Additionally, the increasing number of people who rode public transit systems created
a demand for “railway literature,” as it was called (Williams 1984). These reading materials are
credited with the move toward democratization in England. By 1900 the British middle class
established a rigid definition for itself, and England’s working class also began to self-identify and
demand a better way of life.
Many of the novels of that era are seen as sociological goldmines. They are studied as
existing sources because they detail the customs and mores of the upper, middle, and lower classes
of that period in history.
Examples of “social problem” novels include Charles Dickens’s The Adventures of Oliver
Twist (1838), which shocked readers with its brutal portrayal of the realities of poverty, vice, and
crime. Thomas Hardy’s Tess of the d’Urbervilles (1891) was considered revolutionary by critics
for its depiction of working-class women (DeVine 2005), and American novelist Theodore
Dreiser’s Sister Carrie (1900) portrayed an accurate and detailed description of early Chicago.

9.3 Global Stratification and Inequality

Global stratification compares the wealth, economic stability, status, and power of countries across the
world. Global stratification highlights worldwide patterns of social inequality.
In the early years of civilization, hunter-gatherer and agrarian societies lived off the earth, rarely
interacting with other societies. When explorers began traveling, societies began trading goods, as well
as ideas and customs.
In the 19th century, the Industrial Revolution created unprecedented wealth in Western Europe and
North America. Due to mechanical inventions and new means of production, people began working in
factories—not only men, but women and children as well. By the late 19th and early 20th centuries,
industrial technology had gradually raised the standard of living for many people in the United States
and Europe.
The Industrial Revolution also saw the rise of vast inequalities between countries that were
industrialized and those that were not. As some nations embraced technology and saw increased wealth
and goods, others maintained their ways; as the gap widened, the nonindustrialized nations fell further
behind. Some social researchers, such as Walt Rostow, suggest that the disparity also resulted from
power differences. Applying a conflict theory perspective, he asserts that industrializing nations took
advantage of the resources of traditional nations. As industrialized nations became rich, other nations
became poor (Rostow 1960).

CHAPTER 9 | SOCIAL STRATIFICATION IN THE UNITED STATES

Sociologists studying global stratification analyze economic comparisons between nations.
Income, purchasing power, and wealth are used to calculate global stratification. Global stratification
also compares the quality of life that a country’s population can have.
Poverty levels have been shown to vary greatly. The poor in wealthy countries like the United
States or Europe are much better off than the poor in less-industrialized countries such as Mali or India.
In 2002 the UN implemented the Millennium Project, an attempt to cut poverty worldwide by the year
2015. To reach the project’s goal, planners in 2006 estimated that industrialized nations must set aside
0.7 percent of their gross national income—the total value of the nation’s good and service, plus or
minus income received from and sent to other nations—to aid in developing countries (Landler and
Sanger, 2009; Millennium Project 2006).

Models of Global Stratification

Figure 9.12 Luxury vacation resorts can contribute to a poorer country’s economy. This one, in Jamaica, attracts middle
and upper-middle class people from wealthier nations. The resort is a source of income and provides jobs for local people. Just
outside its borders, however, are poverty-stricken neighborhoods. (Photo courtesy of gailf548/flickr)

Various models of global stratification all have one thing in common: they rank countries according to
their relative economic status, or gross national product (GNP). Traditional models, now considered
outdated, used labels to describe the stratification of the different areas of the world. Simply put, they
were named “first world, “second world,” and “third world.” First and second world described
industrialized nations, while third world referred to “undeveloped” countries (Henslin 2004). When
researching existing historical sources, you may still encounter these terms, and even today people still
refer to some nations as the “third world.”
Another model separates countries into two groups: more developed and less developed. More
developed nations have higher wealth, such as Canada, Japan, and Australia. Less developed nations
have less wealth to distribute among higher populations, including many countries in central Africa,
South America, and some island nations.
Yet another system of global classification defines countries based on the per capita gross domestic
product (GDP), a country’s average national wealth per person. The GDP is calculated (usually
annually) one of two ways: by totaling either the income of all citizens or the value of all goods and
services produced in the country during the year. It also includes government spending. Because the
GDP indicates a country’s productivity and performance, comparing GDP rates helps establish a
country’s economic health in relation to other countries.
The figures also establish a country’s standard of living. According to this analysis, a GDP
standard of a middle-income nation represents a global average. In low-income countries, most people
are poor relative to people in other countries. Citizens have little access to amenities such as electricity,
plumbing, and clean water. People in low-income countries are not guaranteed education, and many are
illiterate. The life expectancy of citizens is lower than in high-income countries.

The Big Picture: Calculating Global
Stratification
A few organizations take on the job of comparing the wealth of nations. The Population Reference
Bureau (PRB) is one of them. Besides a focus on population data, the PRB publishes an annual
report that measures the relative economic well-being of all the world’s countries. It’s called the
GNI PPP.
GNI, or gross national income, measures the current value of goods and services produced by
a country. PPP, or purchasing power parity, measures the relative power a country has to purchase
those same goods and services. So, GNI refers to productive output and PPP refers to buying
power. The total figure is divided by the number of residents living in a country to establish the
average income of a resident of that country.
Because costs of goods and services vary from one country to the next, the GNI PPP converts
figures into a relative international unit. Calculating GNI PPP figures helps researchers accurately
compare countries’ standard of living. They allow the United Nations and Population Reference
Bureau to compare and rank the wealth of all countries and consider international stratification
issues (nationsonline.org).

9.4 Theoretical Perspectives on Social
Stratification
Basketball is one of the highest-paying professional sports. There is stratification even among teams.
For example, the Minnesota Timberwolves hand out the lowest annual payroll, while the Los Angeles
Lakers reportedly pay the highest. Kobe Bryant, a Lakers shooting guard, is one of the highest paid
athletes in the NBA, earning around $25 million a year (Basketballreference.com 2011). Even within
specific fields, layers are stratified and members are ranked.
In sociology, even an issue such as NBA salaries can be seen from various points of view.
Functionalists will examine the purpose of such high salaries, while conflict theorists will study the
exorbitant salaries as an unfair distribution of money. Social stratification takes on new meanings when
it is examined from different sociological perspectives—functionalism, conflict theory, and symbolic
interactionism.

Functionalism
In sociology, the functionalist perspective examines how society’s parts operate. According to
functionalism, different aspects of society exist because they serve a needed purpose. What is the
function of social stratification?
In 1945, sociologists Kingsley Davis and Wilbert Moore published the Davis-Moore thesis, which
argued that the greater the functional importance of a social role, the greater must be the reward. The
theory posits that social stratification represents the inherently unequal value of different work. Certain
tasks in society are more valuable than others. Qualified people who fill those positions must be
rewarded more than others.
According to Davis and Moore, a firefighter’s job is more important than, for instance, a grocery
store cashier’s. The cashier position does not require the same skill and training level as firefighting.
Without the incentive of higher pay and better benefits, why would someone be willing to rush into
burning buildings? If pay levels were the same, the firefighter might as well work as a grocery store
cashier. Davis and Moore believed that rewarding more important work with higher levels of income,
prestige, and power encourages people to work harder and longer.
Davis and Moore stated that, in most cases, the degree of skill required for a job determines that
job’s importance. They also stated that the more skill required for a job, the fewer qualified people there
would be to do that job. Certain jobs, such as cleaning hallways or answering phones, do not require

CHAPTER 9 | SOCIAL STRATIFICATION IN THE UNITED STATES

much skill. The employees don’t need a college degree. Other work, like designing a highway system
or delivering a baby, requires immense skill.
In 1953, Melvin Tumin countered the Davis-Moore thesis in “Some Principles of Stratification: A
Critical Analysis.” Tumin questioned what determined a job’s degree of importance. The Davis-Moore
thesis does not explain, he argued, why a media personality with little education, skill, or talent
becomes famous and rich on a reality show or a campaign trail. The thesis also does not explain
inequalities in the education system, or inequalities due to race or gender. Tumin believed social
stratification prevented qualified people from attempting to fill roles (Tumin 1953). For example, an
underprivileged youth has less chance of becoming a scientist, no matter how smart she is, because of
the relative lack of opportunity available to her.
The Davis-Moore thesis, though open for debate, was an early attempt to explain why stratification
exists. The thesis states that social stratification is necessary to promote excellence, productivity, and
efficiency, thus giving people something to strive for. Davis and Moore believed that the system serves
society as a whole because it allows everyone to benefit to a certain extent.

Conflict Theory

Figure 9.13 These people are protesting a decision made by Tennessee Technological University in Cookeville,
Tennessee, to lay off custodians and outsource the jobs to a private firm to avoid paying employee benefits. Private job
agencies often pay lower hourly wages. Is it fair? (Photo courtesy of Brian Stansberry/Wikimedia Commons)

Conflict theorists are deeply critical of social stratification, asserting that it benefits only some people,
not all of society. For instance, to a conflict theorist, it seems wrong that a basketball player is paid
millions for an annual contract while a public school teacher earns $35,000 a year. Stratification,
conflict theorists believe, perpetuates inequality. Conflict theorists try to bring awareness to
inequalities, such as how a rich society can have so many poor members.
Many conflict theorists draw on the work of Karl Marx. During the 19th-century era of
industrialization, Marx believed social stratification resulted from people’s relationship to production.
People were divided by a single line: they either owned factories or worked in them. In Marx’s time,
bourgeois capitalists owned high-producing businesses, factories, and land, as they still do today.
Proletariats were the workers who performed the manual labor to produce goods. Upper-class
capitalists raked in profits and got rich, while working-class proletariats earned skimpy wages and
struggled to survive. With such opposing interests, the two groups were divided by differences of
wealth and power. Marx saw workers experience deep alienation, isolation and misery resulting from
powerless status levels (Marx 1848).
Today, while working conditions have improved, conflict theorists believe that the strained
working relationship between employers and employees still exists. Capitalists own the means of
production, and a system is in place to make business owners rich and keep workers poor. According to
conflict theorists, the resulting stratification creates class conflict.

Symbolic Interactionism
Symbolic interactionism is a theory that uses everyday interactions of individuals to explain society as a
whole. Symbolic interactionism examines stratification from a micro-level perspective. This analysis
strives to explain how people’s social standing affects their everyday interactions.

203

204

CHAPTER 9 | SOCIAL STRATIFICATION IN THE UNITED STATES

In most communities, people interact primarily with others who share the same social standing. It
is precisely because of social stratification that people tend to live, work, and associate with others like
themselves, people who share their same income level, educational background, or racial background,
and even tastes in food, music, and clothing. The built-in system of social stratification groups people
together.
Symbolic interactionists also note that people’s appearance reflects their perceived social standing.
Housing, clothing, and transportation indicate social status, as do hairstyles, taste in accessories, and
personal style.

stratification do these construction workers share? How do construction workers differ from executives or custodians? Who is
more skilled? Who has greater prestige in society? (Photo (a) courtesy of Wikimedia Commons; Photo (b) courtesy of Chun Kit/

Conspicuous consumption refers to buying certain products to make a social statement about
status. Carrying pricey but eco-friendly water bottles could indicate a person’s social standing. Some
people buy expensive trendy sneakers even though they will never wear them to jog or play sports. A
$17,000 car provides transportation as easily as a $100,000 vehicle, but the luxury car makes a social
statement that the less expensive car can’t live up to. All of these symbols of stratification are worthy of
examination by an interactionist.

Section Summary
9.1 What Is Social Stratification?
Stratification systems are either closed, meaning they allow little change in social position, or open,
meaning they allow movement and interaction between the layers. A caste system is one in which social
standing is based on ascribed status or birth. Class systems are open, with achievement playing a role in
social position. People fall into classes based on factors like wealth, income, education, and occupation.
A meritocracy is a system of social stratification that confers standing based on personal worth,
rewarding effort.

9.2 Social Stratification and Mobility in the United States
There are three main classes in the United States: upper, middle, and lower class. Social mobility
describes a shift from one social class to another. Class traits, also called class markers, are the typical
behaviors, customs, and norms that define each class.

9.3 Global Stratification and Inequality
Global stratification compares the wealth, economic stability, status, and power of countries as a whole.
By comparing income and productivity between nations, researchers can better identify global
inequalities.

9.4 Theoretical Perspectives on Social Stratification
Social stratification can be examined from different sociological perspectives—functionalism, conflict
theory, and symbolic interactionism. The functionalist perspective states that systems exist in society
for good reasons. Conflict theorists observe that stratification promotes inequality, such as between rich
business owners and poor workers. Symbolic interactionists examine stratification from a micro-level
perspective. They observe how social standing affects people’s everyday interactions and how the
concept of “social class” is constructed and maintained through everyday interactions.

1. Track the social stratification of your family tree. Did the social standing of your parents differ from
the social standing of your grandparents and great-grandparents? What social traits were handed down
by your forebears? Are there any exogamous marriages in your history? Does your family exhibit status
consistencies or inconsistencies?

What aspects of your societal situation establish you in a social class?
5. What class traits define your peer group? For example, what speech patterns or clothing trends do
you and your friends share? What cultural elements, such as taste in music or hobbies, define your peer
group? How do you see this set of class traits as different from other classes either above or below
yours?
6. Write a list of 10–20 class traits that describe the environment of your upbringing. Which of these

Introduction to Global Inequality
In 2000, the world entered a new millennium. In the spirit of a grand-scale New Year’s resolution, it
was a time for lofty aspirations and dreams of changing the world. It was also the time of the
Millennium Development Goals, a series of ambitious goals set by UN member nations. The MDGs, as
they become known, sought to provide a practical and specific plan for eradicating extreme poverty
around the world. Nearly 200 countries signed on, and they worked to create a series of 21 targets with
60 indicators, with an ambitious goal of reaching them by 2015. The goals spanned eight categories:
1. To eradicate extreme poverty and hunger

To achieve universal primary education
To promote gender equality and empower women
To reduce child mortality
To improve maternal health
To combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases
To ensure environmental sustainability
To develop a global partnership for development (United Nations 2010)

There’s no question that these were well-thought-out objectives to work toward. So 11 years later,
what has happened?
As of the 2010 Outcome Document, much progress has been made toward some MDGs, while
others are still lagging far behind. Goals related to poverty, education, child mortality, and access to
clean water have seen much progress. But these successes show a disparity: some nations have seen
great strides made, while others have seen virtually no progress. Improvements have been erratic, with
hunger and malnutrition increasing from 2007 through 2009, undoing earlier achievements.
Employment has also been slow to progress, as has a reduction in HIV infection rates, which have
continued to outpace the number of people getting treatment. The mortality and healthcare rates for
mothers and infants also show little advancement. Even in the areas that made gains, the successes are
tenuous. And with the global recession slowing both institutional and personal funding, the attainment
of the goals is very much in question (United Nations 2010).
As we consider the global effort to meet these ambitious goals, we can think about how the
world’s people have ended up in such disparate circumstances. How did wealth become concentrated in
some nations? What motivates companies to globalize? Is it fair for powerful countries to make rules
that make it difficult for less-powerful nations to compete on the global scene? How can we address the
needs of the world’s population?

10.1 Global Stratification and Classification
Just as America’s wealth is increasingly concentrated among its richest citizens while the middle class
slowly disappears, global inequality involves the concentration of resources in certain nations,
significantly affecting the opportunities of individuals in poorer and less powerful countries. But before
we delve into the complexities of global inequality, let’s consider how the three major sociological
perspectives might contribute to our understanding of it.
The functionalist perspective is a macroanalytical view that focuses on the way that all aspects of
society are integral to the continued health and viability of the whole. A functionalist might focus on
why we have global inequality and what social purposes it serves. This view might assert, for example,
that we have global inequality because some nations are better than others at adapting to new
technologies and profiting from a globalized economy, and that when core nation companies locate in
peripheral nations, they expand the local economy and benefit the workers.
Conflict theory focuses on the creation and reproduction of inequality. A conflict theorist would
likely address the systematic inequality created when core nations exploit the resources of peripheral
nations. For example, how many American companies take advantage of overseas workers who lack the
constitutional protection and guaranteed minimum wages that exist in the United States? Doing so
allows them to maximize profits, but at what cost?
The symbolic interaction perspective studies the day-to-day impact of global inequality, the
meanings individuals attach to global stratification, and the subjective nature of poverty. Someone
applying this view to global inequality would probably focus on understanding the difference between
what someone living in a core nation defines as poverty (relative poverty, defined as being unable to
live the lifestyle of the average person in your country) and what someone living in a peripheral nation
defines as poverty (absolute poverty, defined as being barely able, or unable, to afford basic necessities,
such as food).

Global Stratification
While stratification in the United States refers to the unequal distribution of resources among
individuals, global stratification refers to this unequal distribution among nations. There are two
dimensions to this stratification: gaps between nations and gaps within nations. When it comes to global
inequality, both economic inequality and social inequality may concentrate the burden of poverty
among certain segments of the earth’s population (Myrdal 1970). As the chart below illustrates,
people’s life expectancy depends heavily on where they happen to be born.

CHAPTER 10 | GLOBAL INEQUALITY

81 years

Mexico

17.2 deaths per 1000 live births 76 years

Democratic Republic of Congo 78.4 deaths per 1000 live births 55 years
Most of us are accustomed to thinking of global stratification as economic inequality. For example,
we can compare China’s average worker’s wage to America’s average wage. Social inequality,
however, is just as harmful as economic discrepancies. Prejudice and discrimination—whether against a
certain race, ethnicity, religion, or the like—can create and aggravate conditions of economic equality,
both within and between nations. Think about the inequity that existed for decades within the nation of
South Africa. Apartheid, one of the most extreme cases of institutionalized and legal racism, created a
social inequality that earned it the world’s condemnation. When looking at inequity between nations,
think also about the disregard of the crisis in Darfur by most Western nations. Since few citizens of
Western nations identified with the impoverished, non-white victims of the genocide, there has been
little push to provide aid.
Gender inequity is another global concern. Consider the controversy surrounding female genital
mutilation. Nations that practice this female circumcision procedure defend it as a longstanding cultural
tradition in certain tribes and argue that the West shouldn’t interfere. Western nations, however, decry
the practice and are working to stop it.
Inequalities based on sexual orientation and gender identity exist around the globe. According to
Amnesty International, there are a number of crimes committed against individuals who do not conform
to traditional gender roles or sexual orientations (however those are culturally defined). From culturally
sanctioned rape to state-sanctioned executions, the abuses are serious. These legalized and culturally
accepted forms of prejudice and discrimination exist everywhere—from the United States to Somalia to
Tibet—restricting the freedom of individuals and often putting their lives at risk (Amnesty International
2012).

Global Classification
A major concern when discussing global inequality is how to avoid an ethnocentric bias implying that
less developed nations want to be like those who’ve attained post-industrial global power. Terms such
as developing (non-industrialized) and developed (industrialized) imply that unindustrialized countries
are somehow inferior, and must improve to participate successfully in the global economy, a label
indicating that all aspects of the economy cross national borders. We must take care in how we
delineate different countries. Over time, terminology has shifted to make way for a more inclusive view
of the world.
Cold War Terminology
Cold War terminology was developed during the Cold War era (1945–1980). Familiar and still used by
many, it involves classifying countries into first world, second world, and third world nations based on
respective economic development and standards of living. When this nomenclature was developed,
capitalistic democracies such as the U.S. and Japan were considered part of the first world. The
poorest, most undeveloped countries were referred to as the third world and included most of subSaharan Africa, Latin America, and Asia. The second world was the in-between category: nations not
as limited in development as the third world, but not as well off as the first world, having moderate
economies and standard of living, such as China or Cuba. Later, sociologist Manual Castells (1998)
added the term fourth world to refer to stigmatized minority groups that were denied a political voice
all over the globe (indigenous minority populations, prisoners, and the homeless, for example).
Also during the Cold War, global inequality was described in terms of economic development.
Along with developing and developed nations, the terms less-developed nation and underdeveloped
nation were used. This was the era when the idea of noblesse oblige (first-world responsibility) took
root, suggesting that the so-termed developed nations should provide foreign aid to the less-developed
and underdeveloped nations in order to raise their standard of living.
Immanuel Wallerstein: World Systems Approach
Wallerstein’s (1979) world systems approach uses an economic basis to understand global inequality.
He conceived the global economy as a complex system supporting an economic hierarchy that placed

213

214

CHAPTER 10 | GLOBAL INEQUALITY

some nations in positions of power with numerous resources and other nations in a state of economic
subordination. Those that were in a state of subordination faced significant obstacles to mobilization.
Core nations are dominant capitalist countries, highly industrialized, technological, and
urbanized. For example, Wallerstein contends that the U.S. is an economic powerhouse that can support
or deny support to important economic legislation with far-reaching implications, thus exerting control
over every aspect of the global economy and exploiting both semi-peripheral and peripheral nations.
One can look at free trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as
an example of how a core nation is able to leverage its power to gain the most advantageous position in
the matter of global trade.
Peripheral nations have very little industrialization; what they do have often represents the
outdated castoffs of core nations or the factories and means of production owned by core nations. They
typically have unstable government, inadequate social programs, and are economically dependent on
core nations for jobs and aid. There are abundant examples of countries in this category. Check the label
of your jeans or sweatshirt and see where it was made. Chances are it was a peripheral nation such as
Guatemala, Bangladesh, Malaysia, or Colombia. One can be sure the workers in these factories, which
are owned or leased by global core nation companies, are not enjoying the same privileges and rights of
American workers.
Semi-peripheral nations are in-between nations, not powerful enough to dictate policy but
nevertheless acting as a major source for raw material and an expanding middle-class marketplace for
core nations, while also exploiting peripheral nations. Mexico is an example, providing abundant cheap
agricultural labor to the U.S., and supplying goods to the U.S. market at a rate dictated by the U.S.
without the constitutional protections offered to U.S. workers.
World Bank Economic Classification by Income
While there is often criticism of the World Bank, both for its policies and its method of calculating data,
it is still a common source for global economic data. When using the World Bank categorization to
classify economies, the measure of GNI, or gross national income, provides a picture of the overall
economic health of nation. Gross national income equals all goods and services plus net income
earned outside the country by nationals and corporations headquartered in the country doing business
out of the country, measured in U.S. dollars. In other words, the GNI of a country includes not only the
value of goods and services inside the country, but also the value of income earned outside the country
if it is earned by U.S. nationals or U.S. businesses. That means that multinational corporations that
might earn billions in offices and factories around the globe are considered part of the United States’
GNI if they have headquarters in the U.S. Along with tracking the economy, the World Bank tracks
demographics and environmental health to provide a complete picture of whether a nation is highincome, middle-income, or low-income.
High-Income Nations
The World Bank defines high-income nations as having a gross national income of at least $12,276. It
separates out the OECD (Organization for Economic and Cooperative Development) countries, a group
of 34 nations whose governments work together to promote economic growth and sustainability.
According to the Work Bank (2011), in 2010, the average GNI of a high-income nation belonging to the
OECD was $40,136 and the average population was over one billion (1,032,856,261); on average, 77
percent of the population in these nations was urban. Some of these countries include the United States,
Germany, Canada, and the United Kingdom (World Bank 2011). In 2010, the average GNI of a highincome nation that did not belong to the OECD was $23,839 and the average population was about 94
million , of which 83 percent was urban. Examples of these countries include Saudi Arabia and Qatar
(World Bank 2011).
There are two major issues facing high-income countries: capital flight and deindustrialization.
Capital flight refers to the movement (flight) of capital from one nation to another, as when General
Motors automotive company closed American factories in Michigan and opened factories in Mexico.
Deindustrialization, a related issue, occurs as a consequence of capital flight, as no new companies
open to replace jobs lost to foreign nations. As expected, global companies move their industrial
processes to the places where they can get the most production with the least cost, including the
building of infrastructure, training of workers, shipment of goods, and, of course, employee wages. This
means that as emerging economies create their own industrial zones, global companies see the
opportunity for existing infrastructure and much lower costs. Those opportunities lead to businesses
closing the factories that provide jobs to the middle-class within core nations and moving their
industrial production to peripheral and semi-peripheral nations.

Capital Flight, Outsourcing, and Jobs in
America

As mentioned above, capital flight describes jobs and infrastructure moving from one nation to
another. Look at the American automobile industry. In the early 20th century, the cars driven in
America were made in America, employing thousands of workers in Detroit, and providing an
abundance of jobs in the factories and companies that produced everything that made building cars
possible. However, once the fuel crisis of the 1970s hit and Americans increasingly looked to
imported cars with better gas mileage, American auto manufacturing began to decline. During the
recession of 2008, the U.S. government bailed out the three main auto companies, underscoring
their vulnerability. At the same time, Japanese-owned Toyota and Honda and South Korean Kia
maintained stable sales levels.
Capital flight also occurs when services (as opposed to manufacturing) are relocated. Chances
are if you have called the tech support line for your cell phone or internet provider, you’ve spoken
to someone halfway across the globe. This professional might tell you her name is Susan or Joan,
but her accent makes it clear that her real name might be Parvati or Indira. It might be the middle
of the night in that country, yet these service providers pick up the line saying, “good morning,” as
though they are in the next town over. They know everything about your phone or your modem,
often using a remote server to log in to your home computer to accomplish what is needed. These
are the workers of the 21st century. They are not on factory floors or in traditional sweatshops;
they are educated, speak at least two languages, and usually have significant technology skills.
They are skilled workers, but they are paid a fraction of what similar workers are paid in the U.S.
For American and multinational companies, the equation makes sense. India and other semiperipheral countries have emerging infrastructures and education systems to fill their needs,
without core nation costs.
As services are relocated, so are jobs. In the United States, unemployment is high. Many
college-educated people are unable to find work, and those with only a high school diploma are in
even worse shape. We have, as a country, outsourced ourselves out of jobs, and not just menial
jobs, but white-collar work as well. But before we complain too bitterly, we must look at the
culture of consumerism that Americans embrace. A flat screen television that might have cost
$1,000 a few years ago is now $350. That cost savings has to come from somewhere. When
Americans seek the lowest possible price, shop at big box stores for the biggest discount they can
get, and generally ignore other factors in exchange for low cost, they are building the market for
outsourcing. And as the demand is built, the market will ensure it is met, even at the expense of the
people who wanted it in the first place.

CHAPTER 10 | GLOBAL INEQUALITY

Middle-Income Nations
The World Bank defines lower middle income countries as having a GNI that ranges from $1,006 to
$3,975 and upper middle income countries as having a GNI ranging from $3,976 to $12,275. According
to the World Bank (2011), in 2010, the average GNI of an upper middle income nation was $5,886 with
an average population of 2,452,168,701, of which 57 percent was urban. Thailand, China, and Namibia
are examples of middle-income nations (World Bank 2011).
Perhaps the most pressing issue for middle-income nations is the problem of debt accumulation.
As the name suggests, debt accumulation is the buildup of external debt, wherein countries borrow
money from other nations to fund their expansion or growth goals. As the uncertainties of the global
economy make repaying these debts, or even paying the interest on them, more challenging, nations can
find themselves in trouble. Once global markets have reduced the value of a country’s goods, it can be
very difficult to ever manage the debt burden. Such issues have plagued middle-income countries in
Latin America and the Caribbean, as well as East Asian and Pacific nations (Dogruel and Dogruel
2007). By way of example, even in the European Union, which is composed of more core nations than
semi-peripheral nations, the semi-peripheral nations of Italy and Greece face increasing debt burdens.
The economic downturns in both Greece and Italy are threatening the economy of the entire European
Union.
Low-Income Nations
The World Bank defines low-income countries as nations whose GNI was $1,005 or less in 2010.
According to the World Bank (2011), in 2010, the average GNI of a low-income nation was $528 and
the average population was 796,261,360, with 28 percent located in urban areas. For example,
Myanmar, Ethiopia, and Somalia are considered low-income countries. Low-income economies are
primarily found in Asia and Africa (World Bank 2011), where most of the world’s population lives.
There are two major challenges that these countries face: women are disproportionately affected by
poverty (in a trend towards a global feminization of poverty) and much of the population lives in
absolute poverty.
In some ways, the term global feminization of poverty says it all: around the world, women are
bearing a disproportionate percentage of the burden of poverty. This means more women live in poor
conditions, receive inadequate healthcare, bear the brunt of malnutrition and inadequate drinking water,
and so on. Throughout the 1990s, data indicated that while overall poverty rates were rising, especially
in peripheral nations, the rates of impoverishment increased for women nearly 20 percent more than for
men (Mogadham 2005).
Why is this happening? While there are myriad variables affecting women’s poverty, research
specializing in this issue identifies three causes:
1. The expansion of female-headed households
2. The persistence and consequences of intra-household inequalities and biases against women
3. The implementation of neoliberal economic policies around the world (Mogadham 2005)
In short, this means that within an impoverished household, women are more likely to go hungry
than men; in agricultural aid programs, women are less likely to receive help than men; and often,
women are left taking care of families with no male counterpart.

CHAPTER 10 | GLOBAL INEQUALITY

10.2 Global Wealth and Poverty

Figure 10.4 How poor is poor for these beggar children in Vietnam? (Photo courtesy of Augapfel/flickr)
What does it mean to be poor? Does it mean being a single mother with two kids in New York City,
waiting for her next paycheck before she can buy groceries? Does it mean living with almost no
furniture in your apartment because your income doesn’t allow for extras like beds or chairs? Or does it
mean the distended bellies of the chronically malnourished throughout the peripheral nations of SubSaharan Africa and South Asia? Poverty has a thousand faces and a thousand gradations; there is no
single definition that pulls together every part of the spectrum. You might feel you are poor if you can’t
afford cable television or your own car. Every time you see a fellow student with a new laptop and
smartphone you might feel that you, with your ten-year-old desktop computer, are barely keeping up.
However, someone else might look at the clothes you wear and the calories you consume and consider
you rich.

Types of Poverty
Social scientists define global poverty in different ways, taking into account the complexities and the
issues of relativism described above. Relative poverty is a state of living where people can afford
necessities but are unable to meet their society’s average standard of living. People often disparage
“keeping up with the Joneses”—the idea that you must keep up with the neighbors’ standard of living
to not feel deprived. But it is true that you might feel ”poor” if you are living without a car to drive to
and from work, without any money for a safety net should a family member fall ill, and without any
“extras” beyond just making ends meet.
Contrary to relative poverty, people who live in absolute poverty lack even the basic necessities,
which typically include adequate food, clean water, safe housing, and access to health care. Absolute
poverty is defined by the World Bank (2011) as when someone lives on less than a dollar a day. A
shocking number of people––88 million––live in absolute poverty, and close to 3 billion people live on
less than $2.50 a day (Shah 2011). If you were forced to live on $2.50 a day, how would you do it?
What would you deem worthy of spending money on, and what could you do without? How would you
manage the necessities—and how would you make up the gap between what you need to live and what
you can afford?

CHAPTER 10 | GLOBAL INEQUALITY

Subjective poverty describes poverty that is composed of many dimensions; it is subjectively
present when your actual income does not meet your expectations and perceptions. With the concept of
subjective poverty, the poor themselves have a greater say in recognizing when it is present. In short,
subjective poverty has more to do with how a person or a family defines themselves. This means that a
family subsisting on a few dollars a day in Nepal might think of themselves as doing well, within their
perception of normal. However, a westerner traveling to Nepal might visit the same family and see
extreme need.

Making Connections:

the

Big Picture

The Underground Economy Around the World
What do the driver of an unlicensed hack cab in New York, a piecework seamstress working from
her home in Mumbai, and a street tortilla vendor in Mexico City have in common? They are all
members of the underground economy, a loosely defined unregulated market unhindered by
taxes, government permits, or human protections. Official statistics before the worldwide recession
posit that the underground economy accounted for over 50 percent of non-agricultural work in
Latin America; the figure went as high as 80 percent in parts of Asia and Africa (Chen 2001). A
recent article in the Wall Street Journal discusses the challenges, parameters, and surprising
benefits of this informal marketplace. The wages earned in most underground economy jobs,
especially in peripheral nations, are a pittance––a few rupees for a handmade bracelet at a market,
or maybe 250 rupees (around five U.S. dollars) for a day’s worth of fruit and vegetable sales (Barta
2009). But these tiny sums mark the difference between survival and extinction for the world’s
poor.
The underground economy has never been viewed very positively by global economists.
After all, its members don’t pay taxes, don’t take out loans to grow their businesses, and rarely
earn enough to put money back into the economy in the form of consumer spending. But
according to the International Labor Organization (an agency of the United Nations), some 52
million people worldwide will lose their jobs due to the ongoing worldwide recession. And while
those in core nations know that unemployment rates and limited government safety nets can be
frightening, it is nothing compared to the loss of a job for those barely eking out an existence.
Once that job disappears, the chance of staying afloat is very slim.
Within the context of this recession, some see the underground economy as a key player in
keeping people alive. Indeed, an economist at the World Bank credits jobs created by the informal
economy as a primary reason why peripheral nations are not in worse shape during this recession.
Women in particular benefit from the informal sector. The majority of economically active women
in peripheral nations are engaged in the informal sector, which is somewhat buffered from the
economic downturn. The flip side, of course, is that it is equally buffered from the possibility of
economic growth.
Even in the United States, the informal economy exists, although not on the same scale as in
peripheral and semi-peripheral nations. It might include under-the-table nannies, gardeners, and
housecleaners, as well as unlicensed street vendors and taxi drivers. There are also those who run
informal businesses, like daycares or salons, from their houses. Analysts estimate that this type of
labor may make up 10 percent of the overall U.S. economy, a number that will likely grow as
companies reduce head counts, leaving more workers to seek other options. In the end, the article
suggests that, whether selling medicinal wines in Thailand or woven bracelets in India, the
workers of the underground economy at least have what most people want most of all: a chance to
stay afloat (Barta 2009).

Who Are the Impoverished?
Who are the impoverished? Who is living in absolute poverty? The truth that most of us would guess is
that the richest countries are often those with the least people. Compare the United States, which
possesses a relatively small slice of the population pie and owns by far the largest slice of the wealth
pie, with India. These disparities have the expected consequence. The poorest people in the world are
women and those in peripheral and semi-peripheral nations. For women, the rate of poverty is
particularly exacerbated by the pressure on their time. In general, time is one of the few luxuries the

very poor have, but study after study has shown that women in poverty, who are responsible for all
family comforts as well as any earnings they can make, have less of it. The result is that while men and
women may have the same rate of economic poverty, women are suffering more in terms of overall
wellbeing (Buvinic 1997). It is harder for females to get credit to expand businesses, to take the time to
learn a new skill, or to spend extra hours improving their craft so as to be able to earn at a higher rate.
Africa
The majority of the poorest countries in the world are in Africa. That is not to say there is not diversity
within the countries of that continent; countries like South Africa and Egypt have much lower rates of
poverty than Angola and Ethiopia, for instance. Overall, African income levels have been dropping
relative to the rest of the world, meaning that Africa as a whole is getting relatively poorer.
Exacerbating the problem, 2011 saw the beginning of a drought in Northeast Africa that could bring
starvation to millions in the region.
Why is Africa in such dire straits? Much of the continent’s poverty can be traced to the availability
of land, especially arable land (land that can be farmed). Centuries of struggle over land ownership
have meant that much useable land has been ruined or left unfarmed, while many countries with
inadequate rainfall have never set up an infrastructure to irrigate. Many of Africa’s natural resources
were long ago taken by colonial forces, leaving little agricultural and mineral wealth on the continent.
Further, African poverty is worsened by civil wars and inadequate governance that are the result of
a continent re-imagined with artificial colonial borders and leaders. Consider the example of Rwanda.
There, two ethnic groups cohabitated with their own system of hierarchy and management until
Belgians took control of the country in 1915 and rigidly confined members of the population into two
unequal ethnic groups. While, historically, members of the Tutsi group held positions of power, the
involvement of Belgians led to the Hutu’s seizing power during a 1960s revolt. This ultimately led to a
repressive government and genocide against Tutsis that left hundreds of thousands of Rwandans dead or
living in diaspora (U.S. Department of State 2011c). The painful rebirth of a self-ruled Africa has meant
many countries bear ongoing scars as they try to see their way towards the future (World Poverty
2012a).
Asia
While the majority of the world’s poorest countries are in Africa, the majority of the world’s poorest
people are in Asia. As in Africa, Asia finds itself with disparity in the distribution of poverty, with
Japan and South Korea holding much more wealth than India and Cambodia. In fact, most poverty is
concentrated in South Asia. One of the most pressing causes of poverty in Asia is simply the pressure
that the size of the population puts on its resources. In fact, many believe that China’s success in recent
times has much to do with its draconian population control rules. According to the U.S. State
department, China’s market-oriented reforms have contributed to its significant reduction of poverty
and the speed at which it has experienced an increase in income levels (U.S. Department of State
2011b). However, every part of Asia is feeling the current global recession, from the poorest countries
whose aid packages will be hit, to the more industrialized ones whose own industries are slowing down.
These factors make the poverty on the ground unlikely to improve any time soon (World Poverty
2012b).
Latin America
Poverty rates in some Latin American countries like Mexico have improved recently, in part due to
investment in education. But other countries like Paraguay and Peru continue to struggle. Although
there is a large amount of foreign investment in this part of the world, it tends to be higher-risk
speculative investment (rather than the more stable long-term investment Europe often makes in Africa
and Asia). The volatility of these investments means that the region has been unable to leverage them,
especially when mixed with high interest rates for aid loans. Further, internal political struggles, illegal
drug trafficking, and corrupt governments have added to the pressure (World Poverty 2012c).
Argentina is one nation that suffered from increasing debt load in the early 2000s, as the country
tried to fight hyperinflation by fixing the peso to the U.S. dollar. The move hurt the nation’s ability to
be competitive in the world market and ultimately created chronic deficits that could only be financed
by massive borrowing from other countries and markets. By 2001, so much money was leaving the
country that there was a financial panic, leading to riots and ultimately, the resignation of the president.

Sweatshops and Student Protests: Who’s
Making Your Team Spirit?

Figure 10.6 This protester seeks to bring attention to the issue of sweatshops. (Photo courtesy of Ohio AFL-CIO
Labor 2008/flickr)

Most of us don’t pay too much attention to where our favorite products are made. And certainly
when you’re shopping for a college sweatshirt or ball cap to wear to a school football game, you
probably don’t turn over the label, check who produced the item, and then research whether or not
the company has fair labor practices. But for the members of USAS––United Students Against
Sweatshops––that’s exactly what they do. The organization, which was founded in 1997, has
waged countless battles against both apparel makers and other multinational corporations that do
not meet what USAS considers fair working conditions and wages (USAS 2009).
Sometimes their demonstrations take on a sensationalist tone, as in 2006 when 20 Penn State
students protested while naked or nearly naked, in order to draw attention to the issue of sweatshop
labor. The school is actually already a member of an independent monitoring organization called
Worker Rights Consortium (WRC) that monitors working conditions and works to assist colleges
and universities with maintaining compliance with their labor code. But the students were
protesting in order to have the same code of conduct applied to the factories that provide materials
for the goods, not just where the final product is assembled (Chronicle of Higher Education 2006).
The USAS organization has chapters on over 250 campuses in the United States and Canada
and has waged countless campaigns against companies like Nike and Forever 21 apparel, Taco
Bell restaurants, and Sodexo food service. In 2000, members of USAS helped to create WRC.
Schools that affiliate with WRC pay annual fees that help offset the organization’s costs. Over 180
schools are affiliated with the organization. Yet, USAS still sees signs of inequality everywhere.
And the members feel that, as current and future workers, it is within their scope of responsibility
to ensure that workers of the world are treated fairly. For them, at least, the global inequality that
we see everywhere should not be ignored for a team spirit sweatshirt.

CHAPTER 10 | GLOBAL INEQUALITY

Consequences of Poverty

DFID - UK Department for International Development/flickr)

Not surprisingly, the consequences of poverty are often also causes. The poor often experience
inadequate health care, limited education, and the inaccessibility of birth control. But those born into
these conditions are incredibly challenged in their efforts to break out since these consequences of
poverty are also causes of poverty, perpetuating a cycle of disadvantage.
According to sociologists Neckerman and Torche (2007) in their analysis of global inequality
studies, the consequences of poverty are many. They have divided the consequences into three areas.
The first, termed “the sedimentation of global inequality,” relates to the fact that once poverty becomes
entrenched in an area, it is typically very difficult to reverse. As mentioned above, poverty exists in a
cycle where the consequences and causes are intertwined. The second consequence of poverty is its
effect on physical and mental health. Poor people face physical health challenges, including
malnutrition and high infant mortality rates. Mental health is also detrimentally affected by the
emotional stresses of poverty, with relative deprivation carrying the most robust effect. Again, as with
the ongoing inequality, the effects of poverty on mental and physical health become more entrenched as
time goes on. Neckerman and Torche’s third consequence of poverty is the prevalence of crime. Crossnationally, crime rates are higher, particularly with violent crime, in countries with higher levels of
income inequality (Fajnzylber, Lederman and Loayza 2002).

Slavery
While most of us are accustomed to thinking of slavery in terms of the antebellum South, modern day
slavery goes hand-in-hand with global inequality. In short, slavery refers to any time people are sold,
treated as property, or forced to work for little or no pay. Just as in pre-Civil War America, these
humans are at the mercy of their employers. Chattel slavery, the form of slavery practiced in the preCivil War American South, is when one person owns another as property. Child slavery, which may
include child prostitution, is a form of chattel slavery. Debt bondage, or bonded labor, involves the
poor pledging themselves as servants in exchange for the cost of basic necessities like transportation,
room, and board. In this scenario, people are paid less than they are charged for room and board. When
travel is involved, people can arrive in debt for their travel expenses and be unable to work their way
free, since their wages do not allow them to ever get ahead.
The global watchdog group Anti-Slavery International recognizes other forms of slavery: human
trafficking (where people are moved away from their communities and forced to work against their
will), child domestic work and child labor, and certain forms of servile marriage, in which women are
little more than chattel slaves (Anti-Slavery International 2012).

10.3 Theoretical Perspectives on Global
Stratification
As with any social issue, global or otherwise, there are a variety of theories that scholars develop to
study the topic. The two most widely applied perspectives on global stratification are modernization
theory and dependency theory.

221

222

CHAPTER 10 | GLOBAL INEQUALITY

Modernization Theory
According to modernization theory, low-income countries are affected by their lack of
industrialization and can improve their global economic standing through:
1. an adjustment of cultural values and attitudes to work
2. industrialization and other forms of economic growth (Armer and Katsillis 2010)
Critics point out the inherent ethnocentric bias of this theory. It supposes all countries have the
same resources and are capable of following the same path. In addition, it assumes that the goal of all
countries is to be as “developed” as possible. There is no room within this theory for the possibility that
industrialization and technology are not the best goals.
There is, of course, some basis for this assumption. Data show that core nations tend to have lower
maternal and child mortality rates, longer life spans, and less absolute poverty. It is also true that in the
poorest countries, millions of people die from the lack of clean drinking water and sanitation facilities,
which are benefits most of us take for granted. At the same time, the issue is more complex than the
numbers might suggest. Cultural equality, history, community, and local traditions are all at risk as
modernization pushes into peripheral countries. The challenge, then, is to allow the benefits of
modernization while maintaining a cultural sensitivity to what already exists.

Dependency Theory
Dependency theory was created in part as a response to the western-centric mindset of modernization
theory. It states that global inequality is primarily caused by core nations (or high-income nations)
exploiting semi-peripheral and peripheral nations (or middle-income and low-income nations), creating
a cycle of dependence (Hendricks 2010). As long as peripheral nations are dependent on core nations
for economic stimulus and access to a larger piece of the global economy, they will never achieve stable
and consistent economic growth. Further, the theory states that since core nations, as well as the World
Bank, choose which countries to make loans to, and for what they will loan funds, they are creating
highly segmented labor markets that are built to benefit the dominant market countries.
At first glance, it seems this theory ignores the formerly low-income nations that are now
considered middle-income nations and are on their way to becoming high-income nations and major
players in the global economy, such as China. But some dependency theorists would state that it is in
the best interests of core nations to ensure the long-term usefulness of their peripheral and semiperipheral partners. Following that theory, sociologists have found that entities are more likely to
outsource a significant portion of a company’s work if they are the dominant player in the equation; in
other words, companies want to see their partner countries healthy enough to provide work, but not so
healthy as to establish a threat (Caniels and Roeleveld 2009).

Making Connections:

Careers in Sociology

Factory Girls
We’ve examined functionalist and conflict theorist perspectives on global inequality, as well as
modernization and dependency theories. How might a symbolic interactionist approach this topic?
The book Factory Girls: From Village to City in Changing China, by Leslie T. Chang,
provides this opportunity. Chang follows two young women (Min and Chunming) employed at a
handbag plant. They help manufacture coveted purses and bags for the global market. As part of
the growing population of young people who are leaving behind the homesteads and farms of rural
China, these female factory workers are ready to enter the urban fray and pursue an ambitious
income.
Although Chang’s study is based in a town many have never heard of (Dongguan), this city
produces one-third of all shoes on the planet (Nike and Reebok are major manufacturers here) and
30 percent of the world’s computer disk drives, in addition to a plethora of apparel (Chang 2008).
But Chang’s focus is less centered on this global phenomenon on a large scale, and more
concerned with how it affects these two women. As a symbolic interactionist would do, Chang
examines the daily lives and interactions of Min and Chunming—their workplace friendships,
family relations, gadgets and goods—in this evolving global space where young women can leave

CHAPTER 10 | GLOBAL INEQUALITY

tradition behind and fashion their own futures. Their story is one that all people, not just scholars,
can learn from as we contemplate sociological issues like global economies, cultural traditions and
innovations, and opportunities for women in the workforce.

Section Summary
10.1 Global Stratification and Classification
Stratification refers to the gaps in resources both between nations and within nations. While economic
equality is of great concern, so is social equality, like the discrimination stemming from race, ethnicity,
gender, religion, and/or sexual orientation. While global inequality is nothing new, several factors make
it more relevant than ever, like the global marketplace and the pace of information sharing. Researchers
try to understand global inequality by classifying it according to factors such as how industrialized a
nation is, whether a country serves as a means of production or as an owner, and what income a nation
produces.

10.2 Global Wealth and Poverty
When looking at the world’s poor, we first have to define the difference between relative poverty,
absolute poverty, and subjective poverty. While those in relative poverty might not have enough to live
at their country’s standard of living, those in absolute poverty do not have, or barely have, basic
necessities such as food. Subjective poverty has more to do with one’s perception of one’s situation.
North America and Europe are home to fewer of the world’s poor than Africa, which has most poor
countries, or Asia, which has the most people living in poverty. Poverty has numerous negative
consequences, from increased crime rates to a detrimental impact on physical and mental health.

10.3 Theoretical Perspectives on Global Stratification
Modernization theory and dependency theory are two of the most common lenses sociologists use when
looking at the issues of global inequality. Modernization theory posits that countries go through
evolutionary stages and that industrialization and improved technology are the keys to forward
movement. Dependency theory, on the other hand, sees modernization theory as Eurocentric and
patronizing. With this theory, global inequality is the result of core nations creating a cycle of
dependence by exploiting resources and labor in peripheral and semi-peripheral countries.

Short Answer
10.1 Global Stratification and Classification
1. Consider the matter of rock-bottom prices at Walmart. What would a functionalist think of their
model of squeezing vendors to get the absolute lowest prices so they can pass them along to core nation
consumers?
2. Why do you think some scholars find Cold War terminology (“first world” and so on)
objectionable?
3. Give an example of the feminization of poverty in core nations. How is it the same or different in
peripheral nations?
4. Pretend you are a sociologist studying global inequality by looking at child labor manufacturing
Barbie dolls in China. What do you focus on? How will you find this information? What theoretical
perspective might you use?

10.2 Global Wealth and Poverty
5. Consider the concept of subjective poverty. Does it make sense that poverty is in the eye of the
beholder? When you see a homeless person, is your reaction different if he or she is seemingly content
versus begging? Why?
6. Think of people among your family, your friends, or your classmates who are relatively unequal in
terms of wealth. What is their relationship like? What factors come into play?
7. Go to your campus bookstore or visit its website. Find out who manufactures apparel and novelty
items with your school’s insignias. In what countries are these produced? Conduct some research to
determine how well your school adheres to the principles advocated by ASUS.

10.3 Theoretical Perspectives on Global Stratification
8. There is much criticism that modernization theory is Eurocentric. Do you think dependency theory is
also biased? Why or why not?

CHAPTER 11 | RACE AND ETHNICITY

Introduction to Race and Ethnicity
In a mixed vocational/academic high school, Ms. Ellis grades papers for her large, diverse, 11th grade
English class. She is currently looking at the papers of three students: Jose, who is Dominican, Kim,
who is Vietnamese, and Anthony, who is Italian American.
Jose’s grasp of English is weak, and he doesn’t show a high degree of understanding of the themes
of Hamlet. However, Ms. Ellis knows that Jose tried hard, and she also believes that, like many of his
fellow Hispanic students, he will probably not go to college and continue any studies of English
literature. His parents do not speak English and are not overly involved in his schooling. Jose excels in
Automotive Shop, which prepares him for a job in that industry, so Ms. Ellis feels that to push him in
English will not help him. She gives him a C+ and a few neutral words of encouragement without
spending a lot of time pointing out where he could improve.
Ms. Ellis wishes she could have more students like Kim. Kim is unfailingly polite, interested, and
hardworking, even though her English still needs work. Her paper on Hamlet is far from perfect, but
Ms. Ellis knows that she probably worked harder on it than anyone in the class. As is the case with
most of Ms. Ellis’s Asian students, both of Kim’s parents are anxious for Kim to go to college, so even
though Kim’s paper does not show much more understanding of Hamlet than Jose’s, Ms. Ellis gives her
a B and writes ample comments for areas of improvement.
Anthony is a thorn in Ms. Ellis’s side. In this school where most of the teachers and vocational
instructors are Irish American or Italian American, Anthony has always felt at home and overconfident.
His uncle is on the staff, and he has several siblings and cousins who have gone through the school. He
is aggressive and disruptive in class, distracting other students and causing Ms. Ellis to spend an
inordinate amount of time on maintaining discipline. Anthony’s paper is about the same level as Jose’s
and Kim’s, but since English is his first language, he really should be able to perform better. Ms. Ellis
gives him a C- and a few curt comments.
Ms. Ellis graded three similar papers very differently. She didn’t grade them only on their merits;
she relied heavily on her own knowledge of and feelings about the students themselves. Ms. Ellis was
guided by her prejudices: her preconceived notions of the students’ work, attitudes, and abilities. To the
extent that her prejudices affected her actions, Ms. Ellis also practiced discrimination. But what do
these terms mean? Does everyone have prejudices? Is everyone guilty of discrimination? How does our
society foster institutional prejudice and discrimination?

11.1 Racial, Ethnic, and Minority Groups
While many students first entering a sociology classroom are accustomed to conflating the terms
“race,” “ethnicity,” and “minority group,” these three terms have distinct meanings for sociologists. The
idea of race refers to superficial physical differences that a particular society considers significant,
while ethnicity is a term that describes shared culture. And minority groups describe groups that are
subordinate, or lacking power in society regardless of skin color or country of origin. For example, in
modern U.S. history, the elderly might be considered a minority group due to a diminished status
resulting from popular prejudice and discrimination against them. The World Health Organization’s
research on elderly maltreatment shows that 10 percent of nursing home staff admit to physically
abusing an elderly person in the past year, and 40 percent admit to psychological abuse (2011). As a
minority group, the elderly are also subject to economic, social, and workplace discrimination.

What Is Race?
Historically, the concept of race has changed across cultures and eras, eventually becoming less
connected with ancestral and familial ties, and more concerned with superficial physical characteristics.
In the past, theorists have posited categories of race based on various geographic regions, ethnicities,
skin colors, and more. Their labels for racial groups have connoted regions (Mongolia and the Caucus
Mountains, for instance) or denoted skin tones (black, white, yellow, and red, for example).
However, this typology of race developed during early racial science has fallen into disuse, and the
social construction of race is a far more common way of understanding racial categories. According to
this school of thought, race is not biologically identifiable. When considering skin color, for example,
the social construction of race perspective recognizes that the relative darkness or fairness of skin is an
evolutionary adaptation to the available sunlight in different regions of the world. Contemporary
conceptions of race, therefore, which tend to be based on socioeconomic assumptions, illuminate how
far removed modern race understanding is from biological qualities. In modern society, some people

CHAPTER 11 | RACE AND ETHNICITY

who consider themselves “white” actually have more melanin (a pigment that determines skin color) in
their skin than other people who identify as ”black.” Consider the case of the actress Rashida Jones. She
is the daughter of a black man (Quincy Jones) but she does not play a black woman in her television or
film roles. In some countries, such as Brazil, class is more important than skin color in determining
racial categorization. People with high levels of melanin in their skin may consider themselves "white"
if they enjoy a middle-class lifestyle. On the other hand, someone with low levels of melanin in their
skin might be assigned the identity of "black" if they have little education or money.
The social construction of race is also reflected in the way that names for racial categories change
with changing times. It’s worth noting that race, in this sense, is also a system of labeling that provides
a source of identity; specific labels fall in and out of favor during different social eras. For example, the
category ”negroid,” popular in the 19th century, evolved into the term “negro” by the 1960s, and then
this term fell from use and was replaced with “African American.” This latter term was intended to
celebrate the multiple identities that a black person might hold, but the word choice is a poor one: it
lumps together a large variety of ethnic groups under an umbrella term while excluding others who
could accurately be described by the label but who do not meet the spirit of the term. For example,
actress Charlize Theron is a blonde-haired, blue-eyed “African American.” She was born in South
Africa and later became a U.S. citizen. Is her identity that of an “African American” as most of us
understand the term?

What Is Ethnicity?
Ethnicity is a term that describes shared culture—the practices, values, and beliefs of a group. This
might include shared language, religion, and traditions, among other commonalities. Like race, the term
ethnicity is difficult to describe and its meaning has changed over time. And like race, individuals may
be identified or self-identify to ethnicities in complex, even contradictory, ways. For example, ethnic
groups such as Irish, Italian American, Russian, Jewish, and Serbian might all be groups whose
members are predominantly included in the racial category “white.” Conversely, the ethnic group
British includes citizens from a multiplicity of racial backgrounds: black, white, Asian, and more, plus a
variety of race combinations. These examples illustrate the complexity and overlap of these identifying
terms. Ethnicity, like race, continues to be an identification method that individuals and institutions use
today—whether through the census, affirmative action initiatives, non-discrimination laws, or simply in
personal day-to-day relations.

What Are Minority Groups?
Sociologist Louis Wirth (1945) defined a minority group as “any group of people who, because of
their physical or cultural characteristics, are singled out from the others in the society in which they live
for differential and unequal treatment, and who therefore regard themselves as objects of collective
discrimination.” The term minority connotes discrimination, and in its sociological use, the term
subordinate can be used interchangeably with the term minority, while the term dominant is often
substituted for the group that’s in the majority. These definitions correlate to the concept that the
dominant group is that which holds the most power in a given society, while subordinate groups are
those who lack power compared to the dominant group.
Note that being a numerical minority is not a characteristic of being a minority group; sometimes
larger groups can be considered minority groups due to their lack of power. It is the lack of power that
is the predominant characteristic of a minority, or subordinate group. For example, consider Apartheid
in South Africa, in which a numerical majority (the black inhabitants of the country) were exploited and
oppressed by the white minority.
According to Charles Wagley and Marvin Harris (1958), a minority group is distinguished by five
characteristics: (1) unequal treatment and less power over their lives, (2) distinguishing physical or
cultural traits like skin color or language, (3) involuntary membership in the group, (4) awareness of
subordination, and (5) high rate of in-group marriage. Additional examples of minority groups might
include the LBGT community, religious practitioners whose faith is not widely practiced where they
live, and people with disabilities.
Scapegoat theory, developed initially from Dollard’s (1939) Frustration-Aggression theory,
suggests that the dominant group will displace their unfocused aggression onto a subordinate group.
History has shown us many examples of the scapegoating of a subordinate group. An example from the
last century is the way that Adolf Hitler was able to use the Jewish people as scapegoats for Germany’s
social and economic problems. In the United States, recent immigrants have frequently been the
scapegoat for the nation’s—or an individual’s—woes. Many states have enacted laws to disenfranchise
immigrants; these laws are popular because they let the dominant group scapegoat a subordinate group.

CHAPTER 11 | RACE AND ETHNICITY

Multiple Identities

Figure 11.2 Golfer Tiger Woods has Chinese, Thai, African American, Native American, and Dutch heritage. Individuals
with multiple ethnic backgrounds are becoming more common. (Photo courtesy of familymwr/flickr)

Prior to the 20th century, racial intermarriage (referred to as miscegenation) was extremely rare, and in
many places, illegal. While the sexual subordination of slaves did result in children of mixed race, these
children were usually considered black, and therefore, property. There was no question of multiple
racial identities with the possible exception of the Creole. Creole society developed in the port city of
New Orleans, where a mixed-race culture grew from French and African inhabitants. Unlike in other
parts of the country, “Creoles of color” had greater social, economic, and educational opportunities than
most African Americans.
Increasingly during the modern era, the removal of miscegenation laws and a trend toward equal
rights and legal protection against racism have steadily reduced the social stigma attached to racial
exogamy (exogamy refers to marriage outside of one’s core social unit). It is now common for the
children of racially mixed parents to acknowledge and celebrate their various ethnic identities. Golfer
Tiger Woods, for instance, has Chinese, Thai, African American, Native American, and Dutch heritage;
he jokingly refers to his ethnicity as “Cablinasian,” a term he coined to combine several of his ethnic
backgrounds. While this is the trend, it is not yet evident in all aspects of our society. For example, the
U.S. Census only recently added additional categories for people to identify themselves, such as nonwhite Hispanic. A growing number of people chose multiple races to describe themselves on the 2010
Census, paving the way for the 2020 Census to provide yet more choices.

11.2 Stereotypes, Prejudice, and
Discrimination
Stereotypes
The terms stereotype, prejudice, discrimination, and racism are often used interchangeably in everyday
conversation. But when discussing these terms from a sociological perspective, it is important to define
them: stereotypes are oversimplified ideas about groups of people, prejudice refers to thoughts and
feelings about those groups, while discrimination refers to actions toward them. Racism is a type of
prejudice that involves set beliefs about a specific racial group.
As stated above, stereotypes are oversimplified ideas about groups of people. Stereotypes can be
based on race, ethnicity, age, gender, sexual orientation—almost any characteristic. They may be

CHAPTER 11 | RACE AND ETHNICITY

positive (usually about one’s own group, such as when women suggest they are less likely to complain
about physical pain) but are often negative (usually toward other groups, such as when members of a
dominant racial group suggest that a subordinate racial group is stupid or lazy). In either case, the
stereotype is a generalization that doesn’t take individual differences into account.
Where do stereotypes come from? In fact new stereotypes are rarely created; rather, they are
recycled from subordinate groups that have assimilated into society and are reused to describe newly
subordinate groups. For example, many stereotypes that are currently used to characterize black people
were used earlier in American history to characterize Irish and Eastern European immigrants.

Prejudice and Racism
Prejudice refers to beliefs, thoughts, feelings, and attitudes that someone holds about a group. A
prejudice is not based on experience; instead, it is a prejudgment, originating outside of actual
experience. Racism is a type of prejudice that is used to justify the belief that one racial category is
somehow superior or inferior to others. The Ku Klux Klan is an example of a racist organization; its
members’ belief in white supremacy has encouraged over a century of hate crime and hate speech.

Discrimination
While prejudice refers to biased thinking, discrimination consists of actions against a group of people.
Discrimination can be based on age, religion, health, and other indicators; race-based discrimination
and antidiscrimination laws strive to address this set of social problems.
Discrimination based on race or ethnicity can take many forms, from unfair housing practices to
biased hiring systems. Overt discrimination has long been part of U.S. history. In the late 19th century,
it was not uncommon for business owners to hang signs that read, “Help Wanted: No Irish Need
Apply.” And of course, southern Jim Crow laws, with their “Whites Only” signs, exemplified overt
discrimination that is not tolerated today.
However, discrimination cannot be erased from our culture just by enacting laws to abolish it.
Even if a magic pill managed to eradicate racism from each individual’s psyche, society itself would
maintain it. Sociologist Émile Durkheim calls racism a social fact, meaning that it does not require the
action of individuals to continue. The reasons for this are complex and relate to the educational,
criminal, economic, and political systems that exist.
For example, when a newspaper prints the race of individuals accused of a crime, it may enhance
stereotypes of a certain minority. Another example of racist practices is racial steering, in which real
estate agents direct prospective homeowners toward or away from certain neighborhoods based on their
race. Racist attitudes and beliefs are often more insidious and hard to pin down than specific racist
practices.
Prejudice and discrimination can overlap and intersect in many ways. To illustrate, here are four
examples of how prejudice and discrimination can occur. Unprejudiced nondiscriminators are openminded, tolerant, and accepting individuals. Unprejudiced discriminators might be those who,
unthinkingly, practice sexism in their workplace by not considering females for certain positions that
have traditionally been held by men. Prejudiced nondiscriminators are those who hold racist beliefs but
don’t act on them, such as a racist store owner who serves minority customers. Prejudiced
discriminators include those who actively make disparaging remarks about others or who perpetuate
hate crimes.
Discrimination also manifests in different ways. The illustrations above are examples of individual
discrimination, but other types exist. Institutional discrimination is when a societal system has
developed with an embedded disenfranchisement of a group, such as the U.S. military’s historical
nonacceptance of minority sexualities as recently experienced surrounding the “don’t ask, don’t tell”
policy.
Institutional discrimination can also involve the promotion of a group’s status, such as occurs with
white privilege. While most white people are willing to admit that non-white people live with a set of
disadvantages due to the color of their skin, very few white people are willing to acknowledge the
benefits they receive simply by being white. White privilege refers to the fact that dominant groups
often accept their experience as the normative (and hence, superior) experience. Failure to recognize
this “normality” as race-based is an example of a dominant group institutionalizing racism. Feminist
sociologist Peggy McIntosh (1988) described several examples of “white privilege.” For instance, white
women can easily find makeup that matches their skin tone. White people can be assured that, most of
the time, they will be dealing with authority figures of their own race. How many other examples of
white privilege can you think of?

The Confederate Flag vs. the First Amendment

Figure 11.3 To some, the Confederate flag is a symbol of pride in Southern history. To others, it is a grim reminder of
a degrading period of America’s past. (Photo courtesy of Eyeliam/flickr)

In January 2006, two girls walked into Burleson High School in Texas carrying purses that
displayed large images of Confederate flags. School administrators told the girls that they were in
violation of the dress code, which prohibited apparel with inappropriate symbolism or clothing that
discriminated based on race. To stay in school, they’d have to have someone pick up their purses
or leave them in the office. The girls chose to go home for the day, but proceeded on a path of
challenging the action, appealing first to the principal, then to the district superintendent, then to
the U.S. District Court, and finally to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.
Why did the school ban the purses, and why did they stand behind that ban, even when being
sued? Why did the girls, identified anonymously in court documents as A.M. and A.T., pursue
such strong legal measures for their right to carry the purses? The issue, of course, is not the
purses: it is the Confederate flag that adorns them. This case, A.M. and A.T. v Burleson
Independent School District et al. (2009), joins a long line of people and institutions that have
fought for their right to display the Confederate flag. In the end, the court sided with the district
and noted that the Confederate flag carried symbolism significant enough to disrupt normal school
activities.
While many young Americans like to believe that racism is mostly in the country’s past, this
case illustrates how racism and discrimination are quite alive today. If the Confederate flag is
synonymous with slavery, is there any place for its display in modern society? Those who fight for
their right to display the flag say that such a display should be covered by the First Amendment:
the right to free speech. But others say that the flag is equivalent to hate speech, which is not
covered by the First Amendment. Do you think that displaying the Confederate flag should
considered free speech or hate speech?

11.3 Theories of Race and Ethnicity
Theoretical Perspectives
Issues of race and ethnicity can be observed through three major sociological perspectives:
functionalism, conflict theory, and symbolic interactionism. As you read through these theories, ask
yourself which one makes the most sense, and why. Is more than one theory needed to explain racism,
prejudice, stereotypes, and discrimination?

CHAPTER 11 | RACE AND ETHNICITY

Functionalism
In the view of functionalism, racial and ethnic inequalities must have served an important function in
order to exist as long as they have. This concept, of course, is problematic. How can racism and
discrimination contribute positively to society? Sociologists who adhere to the functionalist view argue
that racism and discrimination do contribute positively, but only to the dominant group. Historically, it
has indeed served dominant groups well to discriminate against subordinate groups. Slavery, of course,
was beneficial to slaveholders. Holding racist views can benefit those who want to deny rights and
privileges to people they view as inferior to them, but over time, racism harms society. Outcomes of
race-based disenfranchisement—such as poverty levels, crime rates, and discrepancies in employment
and education opportunities—illustrate the long-term (and clearly negative) results of slavery and
racism in American society.
Conflict Theory
Conflict theories are often applied to inequalities of gender, social class, education, race, and ethnicity.
A conflict theory perspective of U.S. history would examine the numerous past and current struggles
between the white ruling class and racial and ethnic minorities, noting specific conflicts that have arisen
when the dominant group perceived a threat from the minority group. In the late 19th century, the rising
power of black Americans after the Civil War resulted in draconian Jim Crow laws that severely limited
black political and social power. The years since then have showed a pattern of attempted
disenfranchisement, with gerrymandering and voter suppression efforts aimed at predominantly
minority neighborhoods.
Feminist sociologist Patricia Hill Collins (1990) developed intersection theory, which suggests
we cannot separate the effects of race, class, gender, sexual orientation, and other attributes. When we
examine race and how it can bring us both advantages and disadvantages, it is important to
acknowledge that the way we experience race is shaped, for example, by our gender and class. Multiple
layers of disadvantage intersect to create the way we experience race. For example, if we want to
understand prejudice, we must understand that the prejudice focused on a white woman because of her
gender is very different from the layered prejudice focused on a poor Asian woman, who is affected by
stereotypes related to being poor, being a woman, and her ethnic status.
Interactionism
For symbolic interactionists, race and ethnicity provide strong symbols as sources of identity. In fact,
some interactionists propose that the symbols of race, not race itself, are what lead to racism. Famed
Interactionist Herbert Blumer (1958) suggested that racial prejudice is formed through interactions
between members of the dominant group: Without these interactions, individuals in the dominant group
would not hold racist views. These interactions contribute to an abstract picture of the subordinate
group that allows the dominant group to support its view of the subordinate group, thus maintaining the
status quo. An example of this might be an individual whose beliefs about a particular group are based
on images conveyed in popular media, and those are unquestionably believed because the individual
has never personally met a member of that group.

Culture of Prejudice
Culture of prejudice refers to the theory that prejudice is embedded in our culture. We grow up
surrounded by images of stereotypes and casual expressions of racism and prejudice. Consider the
casually racist imagery on grocery store shelves or the stereotypes that fill popular movies and
advertisements. It is easy to see how someone living in the Northeastern United States, who may know
no Mexican Americans personally, might gain a stereotyped impression from such sources as Speedy
Gonzalez or Taco Bell’s talking Chihuahua. Because we are all exposed to these images and thoughts, it
is impossible to know to what extent they have influenced our thought processes.

11.4 Intergroup Relationships
Intergroup relations (relationships between different groups of people) range along a spectrum between
tolerance and intolerance. The most tolerant form of intergroup relations is pluralism, in which no
distinction is made between minority and majority groups, but instead there’s equal standing. At the
other end of the continuum are amalgamation, expulsion, and even genocide—stark examples of
intolerant intergroup relations.

235

236

CHAPTER 11 | RACE AND ETHNICITY

Genocide
Genocide, the deliberate annihilation of a targeted (usually subordinate) group, is the most toxic
intergroup relationship. Historically, we can see that genocide has included both the intent to
exterminate a group and the function of exterminating of a group, intentional or not.
Possibly the most well-known case of genocide is Hitler’s attempt to exterminate the Jewish
people in the first part of the 20th century. Also known as the Holocaust, the explicit goal of Hitler’s
“Final Solution” was the eradication of European Jewry, as well as the decimation of other minority
groups such as Catholics, people with disabilities, and homosexuals. With forced emigration,
concentration camps, and mass executions in gas chambers, Hitler’s Nazi regime was responsible for
the deaths of 12 million people, six million of whom were Jewish. Hitler’s intent was clear, and the high
Jewish death toll certainly indicates that Hitler and his regime committed genocide. But how do we
understand genocide that is not so overt and deliberate?
During the European colonization of the United States, some historians estimate that Native
American populations dwindled from approximately 12 million people in the year 1500 to barely
237,000 Native Americans by the year 1900 (Lewy 2004). European settlers coerced American Indians
off their own lands, often causing thousands of deaths in forced removals, such as occurred in the
Cherokee or Potawatomi Trail of Tears. Settlers also enslaved Native Americans and forced them to
give up their religious and cultural practices. But the major cause of Native American death was neither
slavery nor war nor forced removal: it was the introduction of European diseases and Indians’ lack of
immunity to them. Smallpox, diphtheria, and measles flourished among indigenous American tribes
who had no exposure to the diseases and no ability to fight them. Quite simply, these diseases
decimated the tribes. How planned this genocide was remains a topic of contention. Some argue that the
spread of disease was an unintended effect of conquest, while others believe it was intentional with
rumors of smallpox-infected blankets being distributed as “gifts” to tribes.
Importantly, genocide is not a just a historical concept, but one practiced today. Recently, ethnic
and geographic conflicts in the Darfur region of Sudan have led to hundreds of thousands of deaths. As
part of an ongoing land conflict, the Sudanese government and their state-sponsored Janjaweed militia
have led a campaign of killing, forced displacement, and systematic rape of Darfuri people. Although a
treaty was signed in 2011, the peace is fragile and may break under pressure.

Expulsion
Expulsion refers to a subordinate group being forced, by a dominant group, to leave a certain area or
country. As seen in the examples of the Trail of Tears and the Holocaust, expulsion can be a factor in
genocide. However, it can also stand on its own as a destructive group interaction. Expulsion has often
occurred historically with an ethnic or racial basis. In the United States, President Franklin D.
Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066 in 1942, after the Japanese government’s attack on Pearl
Harbor. The Order authorized the establishment of internment camps for anyone with as little as oneeighth Japanese ancestry (i.e., one great-grandparent who was Japanese). Over 120,000 legal Japanese
residents and Japanese American citizens, many of them children, were held in these camps for up to
four years, despite the fact that there was never any evidence of collusion or espionage. (In fact, many
Japanese Americans continued to demonstrate their loyalty to the United States by serving in the
American military during the War.) In the 1990s, the U.S. executive branch issued a formal apology for
this expulsion; reparation efforts continue today.

Segregation
Segregation refers to the physical separation of two groups, particularly in residence, but also in
workplace and social functions. It is important to distinguish between de jure segregation (segregation
that is enforced by law) and de facto segregation (segregation that occurs without laws but because of
other factors). A stark example of de jure segregation is the apartheid movement of South Africa, which
existed from 1948 to 1994. Under apartheid, black South Africans were stripped of their civil rights and
forcibly relocated to areas that segregated them physically from their white compatriots. Only after
decades of degradation, violent uprisings, and international advocacy was apartheid finally abolished.
De jure segregation occurred in the United States for many years after the Civil War. During this
time, many former Confederate states passed “Jim Crow” laws that required segregated facilities for
blacks and whites. These laws were codified in 1896’s landmark Supreme Court case Plessey v.
Ferguson, which stated that “separate but equal” facilities were constitutional. For the next five
decades, blacks were subjected to legalized discrimination, forced to live, work, and go to school in
separate—but unequal—facilities. It wasn’t until 1954 and the Brown v. Board of Education case that

CHAPTER 11 | RACE AND ETHNICITY

the Supreme Court declared that “separate educational facilities are inherently unequal,” thus ending de
jure segregation in the United States.

Figure 11.4 In the “Jim Crow” South, it was legal to have “separate but equal” facilities for blacks and whites. (Photo

De facto segregation, however, cannot be abolished by any court mandate. Segregation is still alive
and well in the United States, with different racial or ethnic groups often segregated by neighborhood,
borough, or parish. Sociologists use segregation indices to measure racial segregation of different races
in different areas. The indices employ a scale from zero to 100, where zero is the most integrated and
100 is the least. In the New York metropolitan area, for instance, the black-white segregation index was
79 for the years 2005–2009. This means that 79 percent of either blacks or whites would have to move
in order for each neighborhood to have the same racial balance as the whole metro region (Population
Studies Center 2010).

Pluralism
Pluralism is represented by the ideal of the United States as a “salad bowl”: a great mixture of different
cultures where each culture retains its own identity and yet adds to the flavor of the whole. True
pluralism is characterized by mutual respect on the part of all cultures, both dominant and subordinate,
creating a multicultural environment of acceptance. In reality, true pluralism is a difficult goal to reach.
In the United States, the mutual respect required by pluralism is often missing, and the nation’s past
pluralist model of a melting pot posits a society where cultural differences aren’t embraced as much as
erased.

Assimilation
Assimilation describes the process by which a minority individual or group gives up its own identity by
taking on the characteristics of the dominant culture. In the United States, which has a history of
welcoming and absorbing immigrants from different lands, assimilation has been a function of
immigration.

237

CHAPTER 11 | RACE AND ETHNICITY

Figure 11.5 For many immigrants to the United States, the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of freedom and a new life.
Unfortunately, many immigrants have encountered prejudice and discrimination. (Photo courtesy of Mark Heard/flickr)

Most Americans have immigrant ancestors. In relatively recent history, between 1890 and 1920,
the United States became home to around 24 million immigrants. In the decades since then, further
waves of immigrants have come to these shores and have eventually been absorbed into American
culture, sometimes after facing extended periods of prejudice and discrimination. Assimilation may
lead to the loss of the minority group’s cultural identity as they become absorbed into the dominant
culture, but assimilation has minimal to no impact on the majority group’s cultural identity.
Some groups may keep only symbolic gestures of their original ethnicity. For instance, many Irish
Americans may celebrate Saint Patrick’s Day, many Hindu Americans enjoy a Diwali festival, and
many Mexican Americans may celebrate Cinco de Mayo (a May 5th commemoration of Mexican
independence and heritage). However, for the rest of the year, other aspects of their originating culture
may be forgotten.
Assimilation is antithetical to the “salad bowl” created by pluralism; rather than maintaining their
own cultural flavor, subordinate cultures give up their own traditions in order to conform to their new
environment. Sociologists measure the degree to which immigrants have assimilated to a new culture
with four benchmarks: socioeconomic status, spatial concentration, language assimilation, and
intermarriage. When faced with racial and ethnic discrimination, it can be difficult for new immigrants
to fully assimilate. Language assimilation, in particular, can be a formidable barrier, limiting
employment and educational options and therefore constraining growth in socioeconomic status.

Amalgamation
Amalgamation is the process by which a minority group and a majority group combine to form a new
group. Amalgamation creates the classic “melting pot” analogy; unlike the “salad bowl,” in which each
culture retains its individuality, the “melting pot” ideal sees the combination of cultures resulting in a
new culture entirely.
Amalgamation, also known as miscegenation, is achieved through intermarriage between races. In
the United States, anti-miscegenation laws flourished in the South during the Jim Crow era. It wasn’t
until 1967’s Loving v. Virginia that the last antimiscegenation law was struck from the books, making
these laws unconstitutional.

11.5 Race and Ethnicity in the United States
When colonists came to the New World, they found a land that did not need “discovering” since it was
already occupied. While the first wave of immigrants came from Western Europe, eventually the bulk
of people entering North America were from Northern Europe, then Eastern Europe, then Latin
America and Asia. And let us not forget the forced immigration of African slaves. Most of these groups

CHAPTER 11 | RACE AND ETHNICITY

underwent a period of disenfranchisement in which they were relegated to the bottom of the social
hierarchy before they managed (for those who could) to achieve social mobility. Today, our society is
multicultural, although the extent to which this multiculturality is embraced varies, and the many
manifestations of multiculturalism carry significant political repercussions. The sections below will
describe how several groups became part of American society, discuss the history of intergroup
relations for each faction, and assess each group’s status today.

Native Americans
The only nonimmigrant ethnic group in the United States, Native Americans were once a large
population but by 2010 made up only 0.9 percent of U.S. populace (U.S. Census 2010).

Warriors perpetuate unwelcome stereotypes. (Photo (a) courtesy of public domain/Wikimedia Commons; Photo (b)

The sports world abounds with team names like the Indians, the Warriors, the Braves, and even the
Savages and Redskins. These names arise from historically prejudiced views of Native Americans
as fierce, brave, and strong savages: attributes that would be beneficial to a sports team, but are not
necessarily beneficial to Americans who should be seen as more than just fierce savages.
Since the civil rights movement of the 1960s, the National Congress of American Indians
(NCAI) has been campaigning against the use of such mascots, asserting that the “warrior savage
myth . . . reinforces the racist view that Indians are uncivilized and uneducated and it has been
used to justify policies of forced assimilation and destruction of Indian culture” (NCAI Resolution
#TUL-05-087 2005). The campaign has met with only limited success. While some teams have
changed their names, hundreds of professional, college, and K–12 school teams still have names
derived from this stereotype. Another group, American Indian Cultural Support (AICS), is
especially concerned with such names at K-12 schools, grades where children should be gaining a
fuller and more realistic understanding of Native Americans than such stereotypes supply.
What do you think about such names? Should they be allowed or banned? What argument
would a symbolic interactionist make on this topic?
How and Why They Came
The earliest immigrants to America arrived millennia before European immigrants. Dates of the
migration are debated with estimates ranging from between 45,000 and 12,000 BCE. It is thought that
early Indians migrated to this new land in search of big game to hunt, which they found in huge herds
of grazing herbivores in the Americas. Over the centuries and then the millennia, Native American
culture blossomed into an intricate web of hundreds of interconnected tribes, each with its own
customs, traditions, languages, and religions.

CHAPTER 11 | RACE AND ETHNICITY

History of Intergroup Relations
Native American culture prior to European settlement is referred to as Pre-Columbian: that is, prior to
the coming of Christopher Columbus in 1492. Mistakenly believing that he had landed in the East
Indies, Columbus named the indigenous people “Indians:” a name that has persisted for centuries
despite it being a geographical misnomer used to homogenously label over 500 distinct people groups
who have their own languages and traditions.
The history of intergroup relations between European colonists and Native Americans is a brutal
one that most Americans are familiar with. As discussed in the section on genocide, the effect of
European settlement of the Americans was to nearly destroy the indigenous population. And although
Native Americans’ lack of immunity to European diseases caused the most deaths, overt mistreatment
of Native Americans by Europeans was equally devastating.
From the first Spanish colonists to the French, English, and Dutch who followed, European settlers
took what land they wanted, expanding across the continent at will. If indigenous people tried to retain
their stewardship of the land, Europeans fought them off with superior weapons. A key element of this
issue is the indigenous view of land and land ownership. Most tribes considered the earth a living entity
whose resources they were stewards of, the concepts of land ownership and conquest didn’t exist in
Native American society. Europeans’ domination of the Americas was indeed a conquest; one scholar
points out that Native Americans are the only minority group in the United States whose subordination
occurred purely through conquest by the dominant group (Marger 1993).
After the establishment of the United States government, discrimination against Native Americans
was codified and formalized in a series of laws intended to subjugate them and keep them from gaining
any power. Some of the most impactful laws are as follows:
• The Indian Removal Act of 1930 forced the relocation of any native tribes east of the Mississippi
River to lands west of the river.
• The Indian Appropriation Acts funded further removals and declared that no Indian tribe could be
recognized as an independent nation, tribe, or power with which the American government would
have to make treaties. This made it even easier for the U.S. government to take land it wanted.
• The Dawes Act of 1887 reversed the policy of isolating Native Americans on reservations, instead
forcing them onto individual properties that were intermingled with white settlers, thereby
reducing their capacity for power as a group.
Native American culture was further eroded by the establishment of Indian boarding schools in the
late 19th century. These schools, run by both Christian missionaries and the United States government,
had the express purpose of “civilizing” Native American children and assimilating them into white
society. The boarding schools were located off-reservation to ensure that children were separated from
their families and culture. Schools forced children to cut their hair, speak English, and practice
Christianity. Physical and sexual abuses were rampant for decades; only in 1987 did the Bureau of
Indian Affairs issue a policy on sexual abuse in boarding schools. Some scholars argue that many of the
problems that Native Americans face today result from almost a century of mistreatment at these
boarding schools.
Current Status
The eradication of Native American culture continued until the 1960s, when Native Americans were
able to participate in and benefit from the civil rights movement. The Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968
guaranteed Indian tribes most of the rights of the United States Bill of Rights. New laws like the Indian
Self-Determination Act of 1975 and the Education Assistance Act of the same year recognized tribal
governments and gave them more power. Indian boarding schools have dwindled to only a few, and
Native American cultural groups are striving to preserve and maintain old traditions to keep them from
being lost forever.
However, Native Americans (some of whom now wished to be called American Indians so as to
avoid the “savage” connotations of the term “native”) still suffer the effects of centuries of degradation.
Long-term poverty, inadequate education, cultural dislocation, and high rates of unemployment
contribute to Native American populations falling to the bottom of the economic spectrum. Native
Americans also suffer disproportionately with lower life expectancies than most groups in the United
States.

African Americans
As discussed in the section on race, the term African American can be a misnomer for many
individuals. Many people with dark skin may have their more recent roots in Europe or the Caribbean,
seeing themselves as Dominican American or Dutch American. Further, actual immigrants from Africa

CHAPTER 11 | RACE AND ETHNICITY

may feel that they have more of a claim to the term African American than those who are many
generations removed from ancestors who originally came to this country. This section will focus on the
experience of the slaves who were transported from Africa to the United States, and their progeny.
How and Why They Came
If Native Americans are the only minority group whose subordinate status occurred by conquest,
African Americans are the exemplar minority group in the United States whose ancestors did not come
here by choice. A Dutch sea captain brought the first Africans to the Virginia colony of Jamestown in
1619 and sold them as indentured servants. This was not an uncommon practice for either blacks or
whites, and indentured servants were in high demand. For the next century, black and white indentured
servants worked side by side. But the growing agricultural economy demanded greater and cheaper
labor, and by 1705, Virginia passed the slave codes declaring that any foreign-born non-Christian could
be a slave, and that slaves were considered property.
The next 150 years saw the rise of American slavery, with black Africans being kidnapped from
their own lands and shipped to the New World on the trans-Atlantic journey known as the Middle
Passage. Once in the Americas, the black population grew until American-born blacks outnumbered
those born in Africa. But colonial (and later, American) slave codes declared that the child of a slave
was a slave, so the slave class was created. By 1869, the slave trade was internal in the United States,
with slaves being bought and sold across state lines like livestock.
History of Intergroup Relations
There is no starker illustration of the dominant-subordinate group relationship than that of slavery. In
order to justify their severely discriminatory behavior, slaveholders and their supporters had to view
blacks as innately inferior. Slaves were denied even the most basic rights of citizenship, a crucial factor
for slaveholders and their supporters. Slavery poses an excellent example of conflict theory’s
perspective on race relations; the dominant group needed complete control over the subordinate group
in order to maintain its power. Whippings, executions, rapes, denial of schooling and health care were
all permissible and widely practiced.
Slavery eventually became an issue over which the nation divided into geographically and
ideologically distinct factions, leading to the Civil War. And while the abolition of slavery on moral
grounds was certainly a catalyst to war, it was not the only driving force. Students of American history
will know that the institution of slavery was crucial to the Southern economy, whose production of
crops like rice, cotton, and tobacco relied on the virtually limitless and cheap labor that slavery
provided. In contrast, the North didn’t benefit economically from slavery, resulting in an economic
disparity tied to racial/political issues.
A century later, the civil rights movement was characterized by boycotts, marches, sit-ins, and
freedom rides: demonstrations by a subordinate group that would no longer willingly submit to
domination. The major blow to America’s formally institutionalized racism was the Civil Rights Act of
1964. This Act, which is still followed today, banned discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex,
or national origin. Some sociologists, however, would argue that institutionalized racism persists.
Current Status
Although government-sponsored, formalized discrimination against African Americans has been
outlawed, true equality does not yet exist. The National Urban League’s 2011 Equality Index reports
that blacks’ overall equality level with whites has dropped in the past year, from 71.5 percent to 71.1
percent in 2010. The Index, which has been published since 2005, notes a growing trend of increased
inequality with whites, especially in the areas of unemployment, insurance coverage, and incarceration.
Blacks also trail whites considerably in the areas of economics, health, and education.
To what degree do racism and prejudice contribute to this continued inequality? The answer is
complex. 2008 saw the election of this country’s first African American president: Barack Hussein
Obama. Despite being popularly identified as black, we should note that President Obama is of a mixed
background that is equally white, and although all presidents have been publicly mocked at times
(Gerald Ford was depicted as a klutz, Bill Clinton as someone who could not control his libido), a
startling percentage of the critiques of Obama have been based on his race. The most blatant of these
was the controversy over his birth certificate, where the “birther” movement questioned his citizenship
and right to hold office. Although blacks have come a long way from slavery, the echoes of centuries of
disempowerment are still evident.

CHAPTER 11 | RACE AND ETHNICITY

Asian Americans
Like many groups this section discusses, Asian Americans represent a great diversity of cultures and
backgrounds. The experience of a Japanese American whose family has been in the United States for
three generations will be drastically different from a Laotian American who has only been in the U.S.
for a few years. This section primarily discusses Chinese, Japanese, and Vietnamese immigrants and
shows the differences between their experiences.
How and Why They Came
The national and ethnic diversity of Asian American immigration history is reflected in the variety of
their experiences in joining American society. Asian immigrants have come to the United States in
waves, at different times, and for different reasons.
The first Asian immigrants to come to the United States in the mid-19th century were Chinese.
These immigrants were primarily men whose intention was to work for several years in order to earn
incomes to support their families in China. Their main destination was the American West, where the
Gold Rush was drawing people with its lure of abundant money. The construction of the
Transcontinental Railroad was underway at this time, and the Central Pacific section hired thousands of
migrant Chinese men to complete the laying of rails across the rugged Sierra Nevada mountain range.
Chinese men also engaged in other manual labor like mining and agricultural work. The work was
grueling and underpaid, but like many immigrants, they persevered.
Japanese immigration began in the 1880s, on the heels of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882.
Many Japanese immigrants came to Hawaii to participate in the sugar industry; others came to the
mainland, especially to California. Unlike the Chinese, however, the Japanese had a strong government
that negotiated with the United States government to ensure the well-being of their immigrants.
Japanese men were able to bring their wives and families to the United States, and were thus able to
produce second- and third-generation Japanese Americans more quickly than their Chinese
counterparts.
The most recent large-scale Asian immigration came from Korea and Vietnam and largely took
place during the second half of the 20th century. While Korean immigration has been fairly gradual,
Vietnamese immigration occurred primarily post-1975, after the fall of Saigon and the establishment of
restrictive communist policies in Vietnam. Whereas many Asian immigrants came to the United States
to seek better economic opportunities, Vietnamese immigrants came as political refugees, seeking
asylum from harsh conditions in their homeland. The Refugee Act of 1980 helped them to find a place
to settle in the United States.

History of Intergroup Relations
Chinese immigration came to an abrupt end with the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. This act was a
result of anti-Chinese sentiment burgeoned by a depressed economy and loss of jobs. White workers
blamed Chinese migrants for taking jobs, and the passage of the Act meant the number of Chinese
workers decreased. Chinese men did not have the funds to return to China or to bring their families to
America, so they remained physically and culturally segregated in the Chinatowns of large cities. Later
legislation, the Immigration Act of 1924, further curtailed Chinese immigration. The Act included the
race-based National Origins Act, which was aimed at keeping American ethnic stock as undiluted as

CHAPTER 11 | RACE AND ETHNICITY

possible by reducing “undesirable” immigrants. It was not until after the Immigration and Nationality
Act of 1965 that Chinese immigration again increased and many Chinese families were reunited.
Although Japanese Americans have deep, long-reaching roots in the U.S., their history here has
not always been smooth. The California Alien Land Law of 1913 was aimed at them and other Asian
immigrants, and it prohibited aliens from owning land. An even uglier action was the Japanese
internment camps of World War II, discussed earlier as an illustration of expulsion.
Current Status
Asian Americans certainly have been subject to their share of racial prejudice, despite the seemingly
positive stereotype as the model minority. The model minority stereotype is applied to a minority
group that is seen as reaching significant educational, professional, and socioeconomic levels without
challenging the existing establishment.
This stereotype is typically applied to Asian groups in the United States, and it can result in
unrealistic expectations, putting a stigma on members of this group that do not meet the expectations.
Stereotyping all Asians as smart and capable can also lead to a lack of much-needed government
assistance and to educational and professional discrimination.

Hispanic Americans
Like the individuals comprising many “groups,” Hispanic Americans have a wide range of backgrounds
and nationalities. According to the 2010 U.S. Census, about 75 percent of the respondents who identify
as Hispanic report being of Mexican, Puerto Rican, or Cuban origin. Of the total Hispanic group, 60
percent reported as Mexican, 44 percent reported as Cuban, and nine percent reported as Puerto Rican.
Remember that the U.S. Census allows people to report as being more than one ethnicity.
Not only are there wide differences among the different origins that make up the Hispanic
American population, there are also different names for the group itself. The 2010 U.S. Census states
that “Hispanic” or “Latino” refers to a person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central
American, or other Spanish culture or origin regardless of race.” There have been some disagreements
over whether Hispanic or Latino is the correct term for a group this diverse, and whether it would be
better for people to refer to themselves as being of their origin specifically, for example, Mexican
American or Dominican American. This section will compare the experiences of Mexican Americans
and Cuban Americans.
How and Why They Came
Mexican Americans form the largest Hispanic subgroup and also the oldest. Mexican migration to the
United States started in the early 1900s in response to the need for cheap agricultural labor. Mexican
migration was often circular; workers would stay for a few years, and then go back to Mexico with
more money than they could have made in their country of origin. The length of Mexico’s shared
border with the United States has made immigration easier than for many other immigrant groups.
Cuban Americans are the second-largest Hispanic subgroup, and their history is quite different
from that of Mexican Americans. The main wave of Cuban immigration to the United States started
after Fidel Castro came to power in 1959 and reached its crest with the Mariel boatlift in 1980. Castro’s
Cuban Revolution ushered in an era of communism that continues to this day. To avoid having their
assets seized by the government, many wealthy and educated Cubans migrated north, generally to the
Miami area.
History of Intergroup Relations
For several decades, Mexican workers crossed the long border into America, both legally and illegally,
to work in the fields that provided produce for the developing United States. Western growers needed a
steady supply of labor, and the 1940s and 1950s saw the official federal Bracero Program (bracero is
Spanish for strong-arm) that offered protection to Mexican guest workers. Interestingly, 1954 also saw
the enactment of “Operation Wetback,” which deported thousands of illegal Mexican workers. From
these examples, we can see that the U.S. treatment of immigration from Mexico has been ambivalent at
best.
Sociologist Douglas Massey (2006) suggests that although the average standard of living in
Mexico may be lower in the United States, it is not so low as to make permanent migration the goal of
most Mexicans. However, the strengthening of the border that began with 1986’s Immigration Reform
and Control Act has made one-way migration the rule for most Mexicans. Massey argues that the rise
of illegal one-way immigration of Mexicans is a direct outcome of the law that was intended to reduce
it.

243

244

CHAPTER 11 | RACE AND ETHNICITY

Cuban Americans, perhaps because of their relative wealth and education level at the time of
immigration, have fared better than many immigrants. Further, because they were fleeing a Communist
country, they were given refugee status and offered protection and social services. The Cuban Migration
Agreement of 1995 has curtailed legal immigration from Cuba, leading many Cubans to try to
immigrate illegally by boat. According to a 2009 report from the Congressional Research Service, the
U.S. government applies a “wet foot/dry foot” policy toward Cuban immigrants; Cubans who are
intercepted while still at sea will be returned to Cuba, while those who reach the shore will be permitted
to stay in the United States.
Current Status
Mexican Americans, especially those who are here illegally, are at the center of a national debate about
immigration. Myers (2007) observes that no other minority group (except the Chinese) has immigrated
to the United States in such an environment of illegality. He notes that in some years, three times as
many Mexican immigrants may have entered the United States illegally as those who arrived legally. It
should be noted that this is due to enormous disparity of economic opportunity on two sides of an open
border, not because of any inherent inclination to break laws. In his report, “Measuring Immigrant
Assimilation in the United States,” Jacob Vigdor (2008) states that Mexican immigrants experience
relatively low rates of economic and civil assimilation. He further suggests that “the slow rates of
economic and civic assimilation set Mexicans apart from other immigrants, and may reflect the fact that
the large numbers of Mexican immigrants residing in the United States illegally have few opportunities
to advance themselves along these dimensions.”
By contrast, Cuban Americans are often seen as a model minority group within the larger Hispanic
group. Many Cubans had higher socioeconomic status when they arrived in this country, and their antiCommunist agenda has made them welcome refugees to this country. In south Florida, especially,
Cuban Americans are active in local politics and professional life. As with Asian Americans, however,
being a model minority can mask the issue of powerlessness that these minority groups face in U.S.
society.

Arizona’s Senate Bill 1070

Figure 11.8 Protesters in Arizona dispute the harsh new anti-immigration law. (Photo courtesy of rprathap/flickr)
As both legal and illegal immigrants, and with high population numbers, Mexican Americans are
often the target of stereotyping, racism, and discrimination. A harsh example of this is in Arizona,
where a new stringent immigration law—known as SB 1070 (for Senate Bill 1070)—has caused a
nationwide controversy. The law requires that during a lawful stop, detention, or arrest, Arizona
police officers must establish the immigration status of anyone they suspect may be here illegally.
The law makes it a crime for individuals to fail to have documents confirming their legal status,
and it gives police officers the right to detain people they suspect may be in the country illegally.
To many, the most troublesome aspect of this law is the latitude it affords police officers in
terms of whose citizenship they may question. Having “reasonable suspicion that the person is an
alien who is unlawfully present in the United States” is reason enough to demand immigration
papers (Senate Bill 1070 2010). Critics say this law will encourage racial profiling (the illegal
practice of law enforcement using race as a basis for suspecting someone of a crime), making it

CHAPTER 11 | RACE AND ETHNICITY

hazardous to be caught “Driving While Brown,” a takeoff on the legal term Driving While
Intoxicated (DWI) or the slang reference of “Driving While Black.” Driving While Brown refers
to the likelihood of getting pulled over just for being nonwhite.
SB 1070 has been the subject of many lawsuits, from parties as diverse as Arizona police
officers, the American Civil Liberties Union, and even the federal government, which is suing on
the basis of Arizona contradicting federal immigration laws (ACLU 2011). The future of SB 1070
is uncertain, but many other states have tried or are trying to pass similar measures. Do you think
such measures are appropriate?

Arab Americans
If ever a category was hard to define, the various groups lumped under the name “Arab American” is it.
After all, Hispanic Americans or Asian Americans are so designated because of their counties of origin.
But for Arab Americans, their country of origin—Arabia—has not existed for centuries. In addition,
Arab Americans represent all religious practices, despite there being a stereotype of them as Islamic. As
Myers (2007) asserts, not all Arabs are Muslim, and not all Muslims are Arab, complicating the
stereotype of what it means to be an Arab American. Geographically, the Arab region comprises the
Middle East and parts of northern Africa. People whose ancestry lies in that area or who speak
primarily Arabic may consider themselves Arabs.
The U.S. Census has struggled with the issue of Arab identity. The 2010 Census, as in previous
years, did not offer an “Arab” box to check under the question of race. Individuals who want to be
counted as Arabs had to check the box for “Some other race” and then write in their race. However,
when the Census data is tallied, they will be marked as white. This is problematic, however, denying
Arab Americans opportunities for federal assistance.
Why They Came
The first Arab immigrants came to this country in the late 19th and early 20th century. They were
predominantly Syrian, Lebanese, and Jordanian Christians, and they came to escape persecution and to
make a better life. These early immigrants and their descendants, who were more likely to think of
themselves as Syrian or Lebanese than Arab, represent almost half of the Arab American population
today (Myers 2007). Restrictive immigration policies from the 1920s until 1965 curtailed all
immigration, but Arab immigration since 1965 has been steady. Immigrants from this time period have
been more likely to be Muslim and more highly educated, escaping political unrest and looking for
better opportunities.
History of Intergroup Relations
Relations between Arab Americans and the dominant majority have been marked by mistrust,
misinformation, and deeply entrenched beliefs. Helen Samhan of the Arab American Institute suggests
that Arab-Israeli conflicts in the 1970s contributed significantly to cultural and political anti-Arab
sentiment in the United States (2001). The United States has historically supported the State of Israel,
while some Middle Eastern countries deny the existence of the Israeli state. Disputes over these issues
have involved Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, and Palestine.
As is often the case with stereotyping and prejudice, the actions of extremists come to define the
entire group, regardless of the fact that most U.S. citizens with ties to the Middle Eastern community
condemn terrorist actions, as do most inhabitants of the Middle East. Would it be fair to judge all
Catholics by the events of the Inquisition? Of course, the United States was deeply affected by the
events of September 11, 2001. This event has left a deep scar on the American psyche, and it has
fortified anti-Arab sentiment for a large percentage of Americans. In the first month after 9/11,
hundreds of hate crimes were perpetrated against people who looked like they might be of Arab
descent.

Current Status
Although the rate of hate crimes against Arab Americans has slowed, Arab Americans are still victims
of racism and prejudice. Racial profiling has proceeded against Arab Americans as a matter of course
since 9/11. Particularly when engaged in air travel, being young and Arab-looking is enough to warrant
a special search or detainment. This Islamophobia (irrational fear of or hatred against Muslims) does
not show signs of abating. Scholars noted that white domestic terrorists like Timothy McVeigh, who
detonated a bomb at an Oklahoma courthouse in 1995, have not inspired similar racial profiling or hate
crimes against whites.

White Ethnic Americans
As we have seen, there is no minority group that fits easily in a category or that can be described
simply. While sociologists believe that individual experiences can often be understood in light of their
social characteristics (such as race, class, or gender), we must balance this perspective with awareness
that no two individuals’ experiences are alike. Making generalizations can lead to stereotypes and
prejudice. The same is true for white ethnic Americans, who come from diverse backgrounds and have

CHAPTER 11 | RACE AND ETHNICITY

had a great variety of experiences. In this section, we will focus on German, Irish, Italian, and Eastern
European immigrants.
Why They Came
White ethnic Europeans formed the second and third great waves of immigration, from the early 19th
century to the mid-20th century. They joined a newly minted United States that was primarily made up
of white Protestants from England. While most immigrants came searching for a better life, their
experiences were not all the same.
The first major influx of European immigrants came from Germany and Ireland, starting in the
1820s. Germans came both for economic opportunity and to escape political unrest and military
conscription, especially after the Revolutions of 1848. Many German immigrants of this period were
political refugees: liberals who wanted to escape from an oppressive government. They were well-off
enough to make their way inland, and they formed heavily German enclaves in the Midwest that exist
to this day.
The Irish immigrants of the same time period were not always as well off financially, especially
after the Irish Potato Famine of 1945. Irish immigrants settled mainly in the cities of the East Coast,
where they were employed as laborers and where they faced significant discrimination.
German and Irish immigration continued into the late 19th century and earlier 20th century, at
which point the numbers for Southern and Eastern European immigrants started growing as well.
Italians, mainly from the Southern part of the country, began arriving in large numbers in the 1890s.
Eastern European immigrants—people from Russia, Poland, Bulgaria, and Austria-Hungary—started
arriving around the same time. Many of these Eastern Europeans were peasants forced into a
hardscrabble existence in their native lands; political unrest, land shortages, and crop failures drove
them to seek better opportunities in the United States. The Eastern European immigration wave also
included Jewish people escaping pogroms (anti-Jewish uprisings) of Eastern Europe and the Pale of
Settlement in what was then Poland and Russia.
History of Intergroup Relations
In a broad sense, German immigrants were not victimized to the same degree as many of the other
subordinate groups this section discusses. While they may not have been welcomed with open arms,
they were able to settle in enclaves and establish roots. A notable exception to this was during the lead
up to World War I and through World War II, when anti-German sentiment was virulent.
Irish immigrants, many of whom were very poor, were more of an underclass than the Germans. In
Ireland, the English had oppressed the Irish for centuries, eradicating their language and culture and
discriminating against their religion (Catholicism). Although the Irish had a larger population than the
English, they were a subordinate group. This dynamic reached into the new world, where Anglo
Americans saw Irish immigrants as a race apart: dirty, lacking ambition, and suitable for only the most
menial jobs. In fact, Irish immigrants were subject to criticism identical to that with which the dominant
group characterized African Americans. By necessity, Irish immigrants formed tight communities
segregated from their Anglo neighbors.
The later wave of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe was also subject to intense
discrimination and prejudice. In particular, the dominant group—which now included second- and
third-generation Germans and Irish—saw Italian immigrants as the dregs of Europe and worried about
the purity of the American race (Myers 2007). Italian immigrants lived in segregated slums in
Northeastern cities, and in some cases were even victims of violence and lynchings similar to what
African Americans endured. They worked harder and were paid less than other workers, often doing the
dangerous work that other laborers were reluctant to take on.
Current Status
The U.S. Census from 2008 shows that 16.5 percent of respondents reported being of German descent:
the largest group in the country. For many years, German Americans endeavored to maintain a strong
cultural identity, but they are now culturally assimilated into the dominant culture.
There are now more Irish Americans in the United States than there are Irish in Ireland. One of the
country’s largest cultural groups, Irish Americans have slowly achieved acceptance and assimilation
into the dominant group.
Myers (2007) states that Italian Americans’ cultural assimilation is “almost complete, but with
remnants of ethnicity.” The presence of “Little Italy” neighborhoods—originally segregated slums
where Italians congregated in the 19th century—exist today. While tourists flock to the saints’ festivals

in Little Italies, most Italian Americans have moved to the suburbs at the same rate as other white

Section Summary

CHAPTER 11 | RACE AND ETHNICITY

11.1 Racial, Ethnic, and Minority Groups
Race is fundamentally a social construct. Ethnicity is a term that describes shared culture and national
origin. Minority groups are defined by their lack of power.

11.2 Stereotypes, Prejudice, and Discrimination
Stereotypes are oversimplified ideas about groups of people. Prejudice refers to thoughts and feelings,
while discrimination refers to actions. Racism refers to the belief that one race is inherently superior or
inferior to other races.

11.3 Theories of Race and Ethnicity
Functionalist views of race study the role dominant and subordinate groups play to create a stable social
structure. Conflict theorists examine power disparities and struggles between various racial and ethnic
groups. Interactionists see race and ethnicity as important sources of individual identity and social
symbolism. The concept of culture of prejudice recognizes that all people are subject to stereotypes that
are ingrained in their culture.

11.4 Intergroup Relationships
Intergroup relations range from a tolerant approach of pluralism to intolerance as severe as genocide. In
pluralism, groups retain their own identity. In assimilation, groups conform to the identity of the
dominant group. In amalgamation, groups combine to form a new group identity.

11.5 Race and Ethnicity in the United States
The history of the American people contains an infinite variety of experiences that sociologist
understand follow patterns. From the indigenous people who first inhabited these lands to the waves of
immigrants over the past 500 years, migration is an experience with many shared characteristics. Most
groups have experienced various degrees of prejudice and discrimination as they have gone through the
process of assimilation.

CHAPTER 12 | GENDER, SEX, AND SEXUALITY

Introduction to Gender, Sex, and Sexuality
When Harry was born, his parents, Steve and Barb, were delighted to add another boy to their family.
But as their baby boy began to grow and develop, they noticed that Harry began to express himself in a
manner that they viewed as more feminine than masculine. He gravitated toward dolls and other toys
that our culture typically associates with girls. But Harry’s preference was not simply about liking pink
more than blue or flowers more than fire trucks. He even began to draw himself as a girl, complete with
a dress and high-heeled shoes. In fact, Harry did not just wish to be a girl; he believed he was a girl.
In kindergarten, Harry often got into arguments with male classmates because he insisted that he
was a girl, not a boy. He even started calling himself “Hailey.” Steve and Barb met with several
psychologists, all of whom told them that Hailey was transgendered. But Steve and Barb had a hard
time understanding that their five-year-old son could have already developed a gender identity that
went against society’s expectations. Concerned with the social ramifications associated with his child
being transgendered, Steve hoped this was just a phase. But Barb, and eventually Steve, realized that
Harry’s feelings were genuine and unyielding, and they made the decision to let Harry live as Hailey—a
girl. They came to this decision after concluding that the criticism he would endure from his peers and
other members of society would be less damaging than the confusion he might experience internally if
he were forced to live as a boy.
Many transgendered children grow up hating their bodies, and this population can have high rates
of drug abuse and suicide (Weiss 2011). Fearful of these outcomes and eager to make their child happy,
Steven and Barb now refer to Harry as Hailey and allow her to dress and behave in manners that are
considered feminine. To a stranger, Hailey is likely to appear just like any other girl and may even be
considered extra girly due to her love of all things pink. But to those who once knew Hailey as Harry,
Hailey is likely to endure more ridicule and rejection as the result of adopting a feminine gender
identity.
Currently, seven-year-old Hailey and her parents are comfortable with her gender status, but Steve
and Barb are concerned about what questions and problems might arise as she gets older. “Who’s going
to love my child?” asks Steve (Ling 2011). This question isn’t asked because Hailey is unlovable, but
because American society has yet to fully listen to or understand the personal narratives of the
transgendered population (Hanes and Sanger 2010).
In this chapter, we will discuss the differences between sex and gender, along with issues like
gender identity and sexuality. We will also explore various theoretical perspectives on the subjects of
gender and sexuality.

12.1 The Difference Between Sex and Gender

Figure 12.2 While the biological differences between males and females are fairly straightforward, the social and cultural
aspects of being a man or woman can be complicated. (Photo courtesy of FaceMePLS/flickr)

When filling out a document such as a job application or school registration form you are often asked to
provide your name, address, phone number, birth date, and sex or gender. But have you ever been asked
to provide your sex and your gender? As with most people, it may not have occurred to you that sex
and gender are not the same. However, sociologists and most other social scientists view sex and gender
as conceptually distinct. Sex refers to physical or physiological differences between males and females,
including both primary sex characteristics (the reproductive system) and secondary characteristics such
as height and muscularity. Gender is a term that refers to social or cultural distinctions associated with

CHAPTER 12 | GENDER, SEX, AND SEXUALITY

being male or female. Gender identity is the extent to which one identifies as being either masculine or
feminine (Diamond 2002).
A person’s sex, as determined by his or her biology, does not always correspond with his or her
gender. Therefore, the terms sex and gender are not interchangeable. A baby boy who is born with male
genitalia will be identified as male. As he grows, however, he may identify with the feminine aspects of
his culture. Since the term sex refers to biological or physical distinctions, characteristics of sex will not
vary significantly between different human societies. For example, all persons of the female sex, in
general, regardless of culture, will eventually menstruate and develop breasts that can lactate.
Characteristics of gender, on the other hand, may vary greatly between different societies. For example,
in American culture, it is considered feminine (or a trait of the female gender) to wear a dress or skirt.
However, in many Middle Eastern, Asian, and African cultures, dresses or skirts (often referred to as
sarongs, robes, or gowns) can be considered masculine. The kilt worn by a Scottish male does not make
him appear feminine in his culture.
The dichotomous view of gender (the notion that one is either male or female) is specific to certain
cultures and is not universal. In some cultures gender is viewed as fluid. In the past, some
anthropologists used the term berdache to refer to individuals who occasionally or permanently dressed
and lived as the opposite gender. The practice has been noted among certain Native American tribes
(Jacobs, Thomas, and Lang 1997). Samoan culture accepts what they refer to as a “third gender.”
Fa’afafine, which translates as “the way of the woman,” is a term used to describe individuals who are
born biologically male but embody both masculine and feminine traits. Fa’afafines are considered an
important part of Samoan culture. Individuals from other cultures may mislabel them as homosexuals
because fa’afafines have a varied sexual life that may include men or women (Poasa 1992).

Making Connections:

Social Policy

& Debate

The Legalese of Sex and Gender
The terms sex and gender have not always been differentiated in the English language. It was not
until the 1950s that American and British psychologists and other professionals working with
intersex and transsexual patients formally began distinguishing between sex and gender. Since
then, psychological and physiological professionals have increasingly used the term gender (Moi
2005). By the end of the 21st century, expanding the proper usage of the term gender to everyday
language became more challenging—particularly where legal language is concerned. In an effort
to clarify usage of the terms sex and gender, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in a
1994 briefing, “The word gender has acquired the new and useful connotation of cultural or
attitudinal characteristics (as opposed to physical characteristics) distinctive to the sexes. That is to
say, gender is to sex as feminine is to female and masculine is to male” (J.E.B. v. Alabama, 144 S.
Ct. 1436 [1994]). Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg had a different take, however.
Viewing the words as synonymous, she freely swapped them in her briefings so as to avoid having
the word “sex” pop up too often. It is thought that her secretary supported this practice by
suggestions to Ginsberg that “those nine men” (the other Supreme Court justices), “hear that word
and their first association is not the way you want them to be thinking” (Case 1995). This anecdote
reveals that even human experience that is assumed to be biological and personal (such as our selfperception and behavior) is actually a socially defined variable by culture.

Sexual Orientation
A person’s sexual orientation is their emotional and sexual attraction to a particular sex (male or
female). Sexual orientation is typically divided into four categories: heterosexuality, the attraction to
individuals of the opposite sex; homosexuality, the attraction to individuals of one’s own sex;
bisexuality, the attraction to individuals of either sex; and asexuality, no attraction to either sex.
Heterosexuals and homosexuals may also be referred to informally as “straight” and “gay,”
respectively. The United States is a heteronormative society, meaning it supports heterosexuality as the
norm. Consider that homosexuals are often asked, “When did you know you were gay?” but
heterosexuals are rarely asked, “When did you know that you were straight?” (Ryle 2011).
According to current scientific understanding, individuals are usually aware of their sexual
orientation between middle childhood and early adolescence (American Psychological Association

257

258

CHAPTER 12 | GENDER, SEX, AND SEXUALITY

2008). They do not have to participate in sexual activity to be aware of these emotional, romantic, and
physical attractions; people can be celibate and still recognize their sexual orientation. Homosexual
women (also referred to as lesbians), homosexual men (also referred to as gays), and bisexuals of both
genders may have very different experiences of discovering and accepting their sexual orientation. At
the point of puberty, some may be able to claim their sexual orientations while others may be unready
or unwilling to make their homosexuality or bisexuality known since it goes against American society’s
historical norms (APA 2008).
Alfred Kinsey was among the first to conceptualize sexuality as a continuum rather than a strict
dichotomy of gay or straight. To classify this continuum of heterosexuality and homosexuality, Kinsey
created a six-point rating scale that ranges from exclusively heterosexual to exclusively homosexual
(see the figure below). In his 1948 work Sexual Behavior in the Human Male, Kinsey writes, “Males do
not represent two discrete populations, heterosexual and homosexual. The world is not to be divided
into sheep and goats … The living world is a continuum in each and every one of its aspects” (Kinsey
1948).

Figure 12.3 The Kinsey scale indicates that sexuality can be measured by more than just heterosexuality and
homosexuality.

Later scholarship by Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick expanded on Kinsey’s notions. She coined the term
“homosocial” to oppose “homosexual,” describing non-sexual same-sex relations. Sedgwick recognized
that in American culture, males are subject to a clear divide between the two sides of this continuum,
whereas females enjoy more fluidity. This can be illustrated by the way women in America can express
homosocial feelings (nonsexual regard for people of the same sex) through hugging, handholding, and
physical closeness. In contrast, American males refrain from these expressions since they violate the
heteronormative expectation. While women experience a flexible norming of variations of behavior that
spans the heterosocial-homosocial spectrum, male behavior is subject to strong social sanction if it
veers into homosocial territory because of societal homophobia (Sedgwick 1985).
There is no scientific consensus regarding the exact reasons why an individual holds a
heterosexual, homosexual, or bisexual orientation. There has been research conducted to study the
possible genetic, hormonal, developmental, social, and cultural influences on sexual orientation, but
there has been no evidence that links sexual orientation to one factor (APA 2008). Research, however,
does present evidence showing that homosexuals and bisexuals are treated differently than
heterosexuals in schools, the workplace, and the military. It is reported that in the workplace, for
example, discrimination based on sexual orientation occurs at a rate of 4 per 10,000, which is higher
than the rate of discrimination based on race, which stands at 3.90 (Sears and Mallory 2007.)
Much of this discrimination is based on stereotypes, misinformation, and homophobia, an
extreme or irrational aversion to homosexuals. Major policies to prevent discrimination based on sexual
orientation have not come into effect until the last few years. In 2011, President Obama overturned
“don’t ask, don’t tell,” a controversial policy that required homosexuals in the US military to keep their
sexuality undisclosed. Between 2004 and 2010, five states and the District of Columbia legalized gay
marriage. The Employee Non-Discrimination Act, which ensures workplace equality regardless of
sexual orientation, is still pending full government approval. Organizations such as GLAAD (Gay &
Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) advocate for homosexual rights and encourage governments and
citizens to recognize the presence of sexual discrimination and work to prevent it. Other advocacy
agencies frequently use the acronyms LBGT and LBGTQ, which stands for “Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual,
Transgender” (and “Queer” or “Questioning” when the Q is added).

CHAPTER 12 | GENDER, SEX, AND SEXUALITY

Gender Roles
As we grow, we learn how to behave from those around us. In this socialization process, children are
introduced to certain roles that are typically linked to their biological sex. The term gender role refers
to society’s concept of how men and women are expected to act and how they should behave. These
roles are based on norms, or standards, created by society. In American culture, masculine roles are
usually associated with strength, aggression, and dominance, while feminine roles are usually
associated with passivity, nurturing, and subordination. Role learning starts with socialization at birth.
Even today, our society is quick to outfit male infants in blue and girls in pink, even applying these
color-coded gender labels while a baby is in the womb.
One way children learn gender roles is through play. Parents typically supply boys with trucks, toy
guns, and superhero paraphernalia, which are active toys that promote motor skills, aggression, and
solitary play. Daughters are often given dolls and dress-up apparel that foster nurturing, social
proximity, and role play. Studies have shown that children will most likely choose to play with “gender
appropriate” toys (or same-gender toys) even when cross-gender toys are available because parents give
children positive feedback (in the form of praise, involvement, and physical closeness) for gender
normative behavior (Caldera, Huston, and O’Brien 1998).

The drive to adhere to masculine and feminine gender roles continues later in life. Men tend to
outnumber women in professions such as law enforcement, the military, and politics. Women tend to
outnumber men in care-related occupations such as childcare, healthcare, and social work. These
occupational roles are examples of typical American male and female behavior, derived from our
culture’s traditions. Adherence to them demonstrates fulfillment of social expectations but not
necessarily personal preference (Diamond 2002).

Gender Identity
American society allows for some level of flexibility when it comes to acting out gender roles. To a
certain extent, men can assume some feminine roles and women can assume some masculine roles
without interfering with their gender identity. Gender identity is an individual’s self-conception of
being male or female based on his or her association with masculine or feminine gender roles.
Individuals who identify with the role that is the opposite of their biological sex are called
transgender. Transgendered males, for example, have such a strong emotional and psychological
connection to the feminine aspects of society that they identify their gender as female. The parallel
connection to masculinity exists for transgendered females. It is difficult to determine the prevalence of
transgenderism in society. However, it is estimated that two to five percent of the US population is
transgendered (Transgender Law and Policy Institute 2007).
Transgendered individuals who wish to alter their bodies through medical interventions such as
surgery and hormonal therapy—so that their physical being is better aligned with gender identity—are
called transsexuals. They may also be known as male-to-female (MTF) or female-to-male (FTM). Not

CHAPTER 12 | GENDER, SEX, AND SEXUALITY

all transgendered individuals choose to alter their bodies: many will maintain their original anatomy but
may present themselves to society as the opposite gender. This is typically done by adopting the dress,
hairstyle, mannerisms, or other characteristic typically assigned to the opposite gender. It is important to
note that people who cross-dress, or wear clothing that is traditionally assigned to opposite gender, are
not necessarily transgendered. Cross-dressing is typically a form of self-expression, entertainment, or
personal style, not necessarily an expression against one’s assigned gender (APA 2008).
There is no single, conclusive explanation for why people are transgendered. Transgendered
expressions and experiences are so diverse that it is difficult to identify their origin. Some hypotheses
suggest biological factors such as genetics or prenatal hormone levels as well as social and cultural
factors such as childhood and adulthood experiences. Most experts believe that all of these factors
contribute to a person’s gender identity (APA 2008).
It is known, however, that transgendered and transsexual individuals experience discrimination
based on their gender identity. People who identify as transgendered are twice as likely to experience
assault or discrimination as non-transgendered individuals; they are also one and a half times more
likely to experience intimidation (National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs 2010). Organizations
such as the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs and Global Action for Trans Equality work to
prevent, respond to, and end all types of violence against transgender, transsexual, and homosexual
individuals. These organizations hope that by educating the public about gender identity and
empowering transgender and transsexual individuals, this violence will end.

What if you had to live as the opposite sex? If you are a man, imagine that you were forced to
wear frilly dresses, dainty shoes, and makeup to special occasions, and you were expected to enjoy
romantic comedies and TLC reality shows. If you are a woman, imagine that you were forced to
wear shapeless clothing, put only minimal effort into your personal appearance, not show emotion,
and watch countless hours of sporting events and sports-related commentary. It would be pretty
uncomfortable, right? Well, maybe not. Many people enjoy participating in activities that are
typically associated with the opposite sex and would not mind if some of the cultural expectations
for men and women were loosened.
Now, imagine that when you look at your body in the mirror, you feel disconnected. You feel
your genitals are shameful and dirty, and you feel as though you are trapped in someone else’s
body with no chance of escape. As you get older, you hate the way your body is changing, and,
therefore, you hate yourself. These elements of disconnect and shame are important to understand
when discussing transgendered individuals. Fortunately, sociological studies pave the way for a
deeper and more empirically grounded understanding of transgendered experience.

Gender and Socialization
The phrase “boys will be boys” is often used to justify behavior such as pushing, shoving, or other
forms of aggression from young boys. The phrase implies that such behavior is unchangeable and
something that is part of a boy’s nature. Aggressive behavior, when it does not inflict significant harm,
is often accepted from boys and men because it is congruent with the cultural script for masculinity.
The “script” written by society is in some ways similar to a script written by a playwright. Just as a
playwright expects actors to adhere to a prescribed script, society expects women and men to behave
according to the expectations of their respective gender role. Scripts are generally learned through a
process known as socialization, which teaches people to behave according to social norms.
Socialization
Children learn at a young age that there are distinct expectations for boys and girls. Cross-cultural
studies reveal that children are aware of gender roles by age two or three. At four or five, most children
are firmly entrenched in culturally appropriate gender roles (Kane 1996). Children acquire these roles
through socialization, a process in which people learn to behave in a particular way as dictated by

261

262

CHAPTER 12 | GENDER, SEX, AND SEXUALITY

societal values, beliefs, and attitudes. For example, society often views riding a motorcycle as a
masculine activity and, therefore, considers it to be part of the male gender role. Attitudes such as this
are typically based on stereotypes, oversimplified notions about members of a group. Gender
stereotyping involves overgeneralizing about the attitudes, traits, or behavior patterns of women or
men. For example, women may be thought of as too timid or weak to ride a motorcycle.

Figure 12.7 Although our society may have a stereotype that associates motorcycles with men, female bikers
demonstrate that a woman’s place extends far beyond the kitchen in modern America. (Photo courtesy of Robert Couse-Baker/
flickr)

Gender stereotypes form the basis of sexism. Sexism refers to prejudiced beliefs that value one sex
over another. Sexism varies in its level of severity. In parts of the world where women are strongly
undervalued, young girls may not be given the same access to nutrition, healthcare, and education as
boys. Further, they will grow up believing that they deserve to be treated differently from boys
(UNICEF 2011; Thorne 1993). While illegal in the United States when practiced as discrimination,
unequal treatment of women continues to pervade social life. It should be noted that discrimination
based on sex occurs at both the micro- and macro-levels. Many sociologists focus on discrimination
that is built into the social structure; this type of discrimination is known as institutional discrimination
(Pincus 2008).
Gender socialization occurs through four major agents of socialization: family, education, peer
groups, and mass media. Each agent reinforces gender roles by creating and maintaining normative
expectations for gender-specific behavior. Exposure also occurs through secondary agents such as
religion and the workplace. Repeated exposure to these agents over time leads men and women into a
false sense that they are acting naturally rather than following a socially constructed role.
Family is the first agent of socialization. There is considerable evidence that parents socialize sons
and daughters differently. Generally speaking, girls are given more latitude to step outside of their
prescribed gender role (Coltrane and Adams 2004; Kimmel 2000; Raffaelli and Ontai 2004). However,
differential socialization typically results in greater privileges afforded to sons. For instance, boys are
allowed more autonomy and independence at an earlier age than daughters. They may be given fewer
restrictions on appropriate clothing, dating habits, or curfew. Sons are also often free from performing
domestic duties such as cleaning or cooking and other household tasks that are considered feminine.
Daughters are limited by their expectation to be passive and nurturing, generally obedient, and to
assume many of the domestic responsibilities.
Even when parents set gender equality as a goal, there may be underlying indications of inequality.
For example, when dividing up household chores, boys may be asked to take out the garbage or
perform other tasks that require strength or toughness, while girls may be asked to fold laundry or
perform duties that require neatness and care. It has been found that fathers are firmer in their
expectations for gender conformity than are mothers, and their expectations are stronger for sons than
they are for daughters (Kimmel 2000). This is true in many types of activities, including preference of
toys, play styles, discipline, chores, and personal achievements. As a result, boys tend to be particularly
attuned to their father’s disapproval when engaging in an activity that might be considered feminine,
like dancing or singing (Coltraine and Adams 2008). It should be noted that parental socialization and
normative expectations vary along lines of social class, race, and ethnicity. African-American families,
for instance, are more likely than Caucasians to model an egalitarian role structure for their children
(Staples and Boulin Johnson 2004).
The reinforcement of gender roles and stereotypes continues once a child reaches school age. Until
very recently, schools were rather explicit in their efforts to stratify boys and girls. The first step toward
stratification was segregation. Girls were encouraged to take home economics or humanities courses
and boys to take math and science courses.

CHAPTER 12 | GENDER, SEX, AND SEXUALITY

Studies suggest that gender socialization still occurs in schools today, perhaps in less obvious
forms (Lips 2004). Teachers may not even realize that they are acting in ways that reproduce gender
differentiated behavior patterns. Yet, any time they ask students to arrange their seats or line up
according to gender, teachers are asserting that boys and girls should be treated differently (Thorne
1993).
Even in levels as low as kindergarten, schools subtly convey messages to girls indicating that they
are less intelligent or less important than boys. For example, in a study involving teacher responses to
male and female students, data indicated that teachers praised male students far more than their female
counterparts. Additionally, teachers interrupted girls more and gave boys more opportunities to expand
on their ideas (Sadker and Sadker 1994). Further, in social as well as academic situations, teachers have
traditionally positioned boys and girls oppositionally—reinforcing a sense of competition rather than
collaboration (Thorne 1993). Boys are also permitted a greater degree of freedom regarding rulebreaking or minor acts of deviance, whereas girls are expected to follow rules carefully and to adopt an
obedient posture (Ready 2001). Schools reinforce the polarization of gender roles and the age-old
“battle of the sexes” by positioning girls and boys in competitive arrangements.
Mimicking the actions of significant others is the first step in the development of a separate sense
of self (Mead 1934). Like adults, children become agents who actively facilitate and apply normative
gender expectations to those around them. When children do not conform to the appropriate gender
role, they may face negative sanctions such as being criticized or marginalized by their peers. Though
many of these sanctions are informal, they can be quite severe. For example, a girl who wishes to take
karate class instead of dance lessons may be called a “tomboy” and face difficulty gaining acceptance
from both male and female peer groups (Ready 2001). Boys, especially, are subject to intense ridicule
for gender nonconformity (Coltrane and Adams 2004; Kimmel 2000).
Mass media serves as another significant agent of gender socialization. In television and movies,
women tend to have less significant roles and are often portrayed as wives or mothers. When women
are given a lead role, they are often one of two extremes: a wholesome, saint-like figure or a
malevolent, hypersexual figure (Etaugh and Bridges 2003). This same inequality is pervasive in
children’s movies (Smith 2008). Research indicates that of the 101 top-grossing G-rated movies
released between 1990 and 2005, three out of four characters were male. Out of those 101 movies, only
seven were near being gender balanced, with a character ratio of less than 1.5 males per 1 female
(Smith 2008).
Television commercials and other forms of advertising also reinforce inequality and gender-based
stereotypes. Women are almost exclusively present in ads promoting cooking, cleaning, or childcarerelated products (Davis 1993). Think about the last time you saw a man star in a dishwasher or laundry
detergent commercial. In general, women are underrepresented in roles that involve leadership,
intelligence, or a balanced psyche. Of particular concern is the depiction of women in ways that are
dehumanizing, especially in music videos. Even in mainstream advertising, however, themes
intermingling violence and sexuality are quite common (Kilbourne 2000).
Social Stratification and Inequality
Stratification refers to a system in which groups of people experience unequal access to basic, yet
highly valuable, social resources. The United States is characterized by gender stratification (as well as
stratification of race, income, occupation, and the like). Evidence of gender stratification is especially
keen within the economic realm. Despite making up nearly half (49.8 percent) of payroll employment,
men vastly outnumber women in authoritative, powerful, and, therefore, high-earning jobs (U.S. Census
Bureau 2010). Even when a woman’s employment status is equal to a man’s, she will generally only
make 77 cents for every dollar made by her male counterpart (U.S. Census Bureau 2010). Additionally,
women who are in the paid labor force still do the majority of the unpaid work at home. On an average
day, 84 percent of women (compared to 67 percent of men) spend time doing household management
activities (U.S. Census Bureau 2011). This double duty keeps working women in a subordinate role in
the family structure (Hochschild and Machung 1989).
Gender stratification through the division of labor is not exclusively American. According to
George Murdock’s classic work, Outline of World Cultures (1954), all societies classify work by
gender. When a pattern appears in all societies, it is called a cultural universal. While the phenomenon
of assigning work by gender is universal, its specifics are not. The same task is not assigned to either
men or women worldwide. But the way each task’s associated gender is valued is notable. In Murdock’s
examination of the division of labor among 324 societies around the world, he found that in nearly all
cases the jobs assigned to men were given greater prestige (Murdock and White 1968). Even if the job
types were very similar and the differences slight, men’s work was still considered more vital.

CHAPTER 12 | GENDER, SEX, AND SEXUALITY

There is a long history of gender stratification in the United States. When looking to the past, it
would appear that society has made great strides in terms of abolishing some of the most blatant forms
of gender inequality (see timeline below) but underlying effects of male dominance still permeate many
aspects of society.

Theoretical Perspectives on Gender
Sociological theories serve to guide the research process and offer a means for interpreting research
data and explaining social phenomena. For example, a sociologist interested in gender stratification in
education may study why middle-school girls are more likely than their male counterparts to fall behind
grade-level expectations in math and science. Another scholar might investigate why women are
underrepresented in political office, while another might examine how congresswomen are treated by
their male counterparts in meetings.
Structural Functionalism
Structural functionalism has provided one of the most important perspectives of sociological research in
the twentieth century and has been a major influence on research in the social sciences, including
gender studies. Viewing the family as the most integral component of society, assumptions about
gender roles within marriage assume a prominent place in this perspective.
Functionalists argue that gender roles were established well before the pre-industrial era when men
typically took care of responsibilities outside of the home, such as hunting, and women typically took
care of the domestic responsibilities in or around the home. These roles were considered functional
because women were often limited by the physical restraints of pregnancy and nursing and unable to
leave the home for long periods of time. Once established, these roles were passed on to subsequent
generations since they served as an effective means of keeping the family system functioning properly.
When changes occurred in the social and economic climate of the United States during World War
II, changes in the family structure also occurred. Many women had to assume the role of breadwinner
(or modern hunter and gatherer) alongside their domestic role in order to stabilize a rapidly changing
society. When the men returned from war and wanted to reclaim their jobs, society fell back into a state
of imbalance, as many women did not want to forfeit their wage-earning positions (Hawke 2007).
Conflict Theory
According to conflict theory, society is a struggle for dominance among social groups (like women
versus men) that compete for scarce resources. When sociologists examine gender from this
perspective, we can view men as the dominant group and women as the subordinate group. According
to conflict theory, social problems are created when dominant groups exploit or oppress subordinate
groups. Consider the Women’s Suffrage Movement or the debate over women’s “right to choose” their
reproductive futures. It is difficult for women to rise above men, as dominant group members create the
rules for success and opportunity in society (Farrington and Chertok 1993).

CHAPTER 12 | GENDER, SEX, AND SEXUALITY

Friedrich Engels, a German sociologist, studied family structure and gender roles. Engels
suggested that the same owner-worker relationship seen in the labor force is also seen in the household,
with women assuming the role of the proletariat. This is due to women’s dependence on men for the
attainment of wages, which is even worse for women who are entirely dependent upon their spouses for
economic support. Contemporary conflict theorists suggest that when women become wage earners,
they can gain power in the family structure and create more democratic arrangements in the home,
although they may still carry the majority of the domestic burden, as noted earlier (Rismanand and
Johnson-Sumerford 1998).
Feminist Theory
Feminist theory is a type of conflict theory that examines inequalities in gender-related issues. It uses
the conflict approach to examine the maintenance of gender roles and inequalities. Radical feminism, in
particular, considers the role of the family in perpetuating male dominance. In patriarchal societies,
men’s contributions are seen as more valuable than those of women. Additionally, women often
perceive a disconnect between their personal experiences and the experiences upheld by society as a
whole. Patriarchal perspectives and arrangements are widespread and taken for granted. As a result,
women’s viewpoints tend to be silenced or marginalized to the point of being discredited or considered
invalid.
Sanday’s study of the Indonesian Minangkabau (2004) revealed that in societies that some
consider to be matriarchies (where women comprise the dominant group), women and men tend to
work cooperatively rather than competitively regardless of whether a job is considered feminine by
American standards. The men, however, do not experience the sense of bifurcated consciousness under
this social structure that modern U.S. females encounter (Sanday 2004).
Symbolic Interactionism
Symbolic interactionism aims to understand human behavior by analyzing the critical role of symbols
in human interaction. This is certainly relevant to the discussion of masculinity and femininity. Imagine
that you walk into a bank, hoping to get a small loan for school, a home, or a small business venture. If
you meet with a male loan officer, you may state your case logically by listing all of the hard numbers
that make you a qualified applicant as a means of appealing to the analytical characteristics associated
with masculinity. If you meet with a female loan officer, you may make an emotional appeal by stating
your good intentions as a means of appealing to the caring characteristics associated with femininity.
Because the meanings attached to symbols are socially created and not natural, and fluid, not
static, we act and react to symbols based on the current assigned meaning. The word gay, for example,
once meant “cheerful,” but by the 1960s it carried the primary meaning of “homosexual.” In transition,
it was even known to mean “careless” or “bright and showing” (Oxford American Dictionary 2010).
Furthermore, the word gay (as it refers to a homosexual), carried a somewhat negative and unfavorable
meaning 50 years ago, but has since gained more neutral and even positive connotations.
These shifts in symbolic meaning apply to family structure as well. A half-century ago, when only
20 percent of married women with preschool-aged children were part of the paid workforce, a working
mother was considered an anomaly and there was a general view that women who worked were
“selfish” and not good mothers. Today, when a majority of women with preschool-aged children are
part of the paid workforce (60 percent), a working mother is viewed as more normal (Coltrane and
Adams 2008).
Sociologist Charles H. Cooley’s concept of the “looking-glass self” (1902) can also be applied to
interactionist gender studies. Cooley suggests that one’s determination of self is based mainly on the
view of society (for instance, if society perceives a man as masculine, then that man will perceive
himself as masculine). When people perform tasks or possess characteristics based on the gender role
assigned to them, they are said to be doing gender. This notion is based on the work of West &
Zimmerman (1987). Whether we are expressing our masculinity or femininity, West and Zimmerman
argue, we are always “doing gender.” Thus, gender is something we do or perform, not something we
are.

Making Connections:

Sociological Research

Being Male, Being Female, and Being Healthy
In 1971, Broverman and Broverman conducted a groundbreaking study on the traits mental health
workers ascribed to males and females. When asked to name the characteristics of a female, the
list featured words such as unaggressive, gentle, emotional, tactful, less logical, not ambitious,
dependent, passive, and neat. The list of male characteristics featured words such as aggressive,
rough, unemotional, blunt, logical, direct, active, and sloppy (Seem and Clark 2006). Later, when
asked to describe the characteristics of a healthy person (not gender specific), the list was nearly
identical to that of a male.
This study uncovered the general assumption that being female is associated with being
somewhat unhealthy or not of sound mind. This concept seems extremely dated, but in 2006, Seem
and Clark replicated the study and found similar results. Again, the characteristics associated with
a healthy male were very similar to that of a healthy (genderless) adult. The list of characteristics
associated with being female broadened somewhat but did not show significant change from the
original study (Seem and Clark 2006). This interpretation of feminine characteristic may help us
one day better understand gender disparities in certain illnesses, such as why one in eight women
can be expected to develop clinical depression in her lifetime (National Institute of Mental Health
1999). Perhaps these diagnoses are not just a reflection of women’s health, but also a reflection of
society’s labeling of female characteristics, or the result of institutionalized sexism.

12.3 Sex and Sexuality

Figure 12.9 Sexual practices can differ greatly among groups. Recent trends include the finding that married couples have
sex more frequently than do singles and that 27 percent of married couples in their 30s have sex at least twice a week (NSSHB
2010). (Photo courtesy of epSos.de/flickr)

Sexual Attitudes and Practices
In the area of sexuality, sociologists focus their attention on sexual attitudes and practices, not on
physiology or anatomy. Sexuality is viewed as a person’s capacity for sexual feelings. Studying sexual
attitudes and practices is a particularly interesting field of sociology because sexual behavior is a
cultural universal. Throughout time and place, the vast majority of human beings have participated in
sexual relationships (Broude 2003). Each society, however, interprets sexuality and sexual activity in
different ways. Many societies around the world have different attitudes about premarital sex, the age of
sexual consent, homosexuality, masturbation, and other sexual behaviors that are not consistent with
universally cultural norms (Widmer, Treas and Newcomb 1998). At the same time, sociologists have
learned that certain norms (like disapproval of incest) are shared among most societies. Likewise,
societies generally have norms that reinforce their accepted social system of sexuality.
What is considered “normal” in terms of sexual behavior is based on the mores and values of the
society. Societies that value monogamy, for example, would likely oppose extramarital sex. Individuals
are socialized to sexual attitudes by their family, education system, peers, media, and religion.

CHAPTER 12 | GENDER, SEX, AND SEXUALITY

Historically, religion has been the greatest influence on sexual behavior in most societies, but in more
recent years, peers and the media have emerged as two of the strongest influences, particularly with
American teens (Potard, Courtois, and Rusch 2008). Let us take a closer look at sexual attitudes in the
United States and around the world.
Sexuality around the World
Cross-national research on sexual attitudes in industrialized nations reveals that normative standards
differ across the world. For example, several studies have shown that Scandinavian students are more
tolerant of premarital sex than are American students (Grose 2007). A study of 37 countries reported
that non-Western societies—like China, Iran, and India—valued chastity highly in a potential mate,
while Western European countries—such as France, the Netherlands, and Sweden—placed little value
on prior sexual experiences (Buss 1989).
Even among Western cultures, attitudes can differ. For example, according to a 33,590-person
survey across 24 countries, 89 percent of Swedes responded that there is nothing wrong with premarital
sex, while only 42 percent of Irish responded this way. From the same study, 93 percent of Filipinos
responded that sex before age 16 is always wrong or almost always wrong, while only 75 percent of
Russians responded this way (Widmer, Treas, and Newcomb 1998). Sexual attitudes can also vary
within a country. For instance, 45 percent of Spaniards responded that homosexuality is always wrong,
while 42 percent responded that it is never wrong; only 13 percent responded somewhere in the middle
(Widmer, Treas, and Newcomb 1998).
Of industrialized nations, Sweden is thought to be the most liberal when it comes to attitudes about
sex, including sexual practices and sexual openness. The country has very few regulations on sexual
images in the media, and sex education, which starts around age six, is a compulsory part of Swedish
school curricula. Sweden’s permissive approach to sex has helped the country avoid some of the major
social problems associated with sex. For example, rates of teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted
disease are among the world’s lowest (Grose 2007). It would appear that Sweden is a model for the
benefits of sexual freedom and frankness. However, implementing Swedish ideals and policies
regarding sexuality in other, more politically conservative, nations would likely be met with resistance.
Sexuality in the United States
The United States prides itself on being the land of the “free,” but it is rather restrictive when it comes
to its citizens’ general attitudes about sex compared to other industrialized nations. In an international
survey, 29 percent of Americans stated that premarital sex is always wrong, while the average among
the 24 countries surveyed was 17 percent. Similar discrepancies were found in questions about the
condemnation of sex before the age of 16, extramarital sex, and homosexuality, with American total
disapproval of these each acts being 12, 13, and 11 percent higher, respectively, than the study’s average
(Widmer, Treas and Newcomb 1998).
American culture is particularly restrictive in its attitudes about sex when it comes to women and
sexuality. It is widely believed that men are more sexual than are women. In fact, there is a popular
notion that men think about sex every seven seconds. Research, however, suggests that men think about
sex an average of 19 times per day, compared to 10 times per day for women (Fisher, Moore, and
Pittenger 2011).
Belief that men have—or have the right to—more sexual urges than women creates a double
standard. Ira Reiss, a pioneer researcher in the field of sexual studies, defined the double standard as
prohibiting premarital sexual intercourse for women but allowing it for men (Reiss 1960). This standard
has evolved into allowing women to engage in premarital sex only within committed love relationships,
but allowing men to engage in sexual relationships with as many partners as they wish without
condition (Milhausen and Herold 1999). Due to this double standard, a woman is likely to have fewer
sexual partners in her life time than a man. According to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) survey, the average 35-year-old woman has had three opposite-sex sexual partners while the
average 35-year-old man has had twice as many (Centers for Disease Control 2011).
The future of a society’s sexual attitudes may be somewhat predicted by the values and beliefs that
a country’s youth expresses about sex and sexuality. Data from the 2008 National Survey of Family
Growth reveals that 64 percent of boys and 71 percent of girls ages 15–19 said they “agree” or
“strongly agree” that “it’s okay for an unmarried female to have a child.” In a separate survey, 65
percent of teens stated that they “strongly agreed” or “somewhat agreed” that although waiting until
marriage for sex is a nice idea, it’s not realistic (NBC News 2005). This does not mean that today’s
youth have given up traditional sexual values such as monogamy. Nearly all college men (98.9 percent)
and women (99.2 percent) who participated in a 2002 study on sexual attitudes stated they wished to

267

268

CHAPTER 12 | GENDER, SEX, AND SEXUALITY

settle down with one mutually exclusive sexual partner at some point in their lives, ideally within the
next five years (Pedersen et al. 2002).
Sex Education
One of the biggest controversies regarding sexual attitudes is sexual education in American classrooms.
Unlike in Sweden, sex education is not required in all public school curricula in the United States. The
heart of the controversy is not about whether sex education should be taught in school (studies have
shown that only seven percent of Americans oppose sex education in schools), it is about the type of sex
education that should be taught.
Much of the debate is over the issue of abstinence. In a 2005 survey, 15 percent of Americans
believed that schools should teach abstinence exclusively and should not provide contraceptives or
information on how to obtain them. Forty-six percent believed that schools should institute an
abstinence-plus approach, which teaches children that abstinence is best, but still gives information
about protected sex. Thirty-six percent believed that teaching about abstinence is not important and that
sex education should focus on sexual safety and responsibility (NPR 2010).
Research suggests that while government officials may still be debating about the content of
sexual education in public schools, the majority of Americans are not. Those who advocated for
abstinence-only programs may be the proverbial squeaky wheel when it comes to this controversy, as
they represent only 15 percent of parents. Fifty-five percent of Americans feel that giving teens
information about sex and how to obtain and use protection will not encourage them to have sexual
relations earlier than they would under an abstinence program. Additionally, 77 percent think such a
curriculum would make teens more likely to practice safe sex now and in the future (NPR 2004).
Sweden, which has a comprehensive sex education program in its public schools that educates
participants about safe sex, can serve as a model for this approach. The teenage birthrate in Sweden is 7
per 1,000 births, compared with 49 per 1,000 births in the United States. Additionally, among 15- to
19-year-olds, reported cases of gonorrhea in Sweden are nearly 600 times lower than in the United
States (Grose 2007).

mandated the HPV vaccine for middle-school girls in his home state of Texas. Since the vaccine, which helps prevent cervical
cancer, also protects against a sexually-transmitted virus, abstinence-only conservatives criticized his action. (Photo courtesy of

Sociological Perspectives on Sex and Sexuality
Sociologists representing all three major theoretical perspectives study the role that sexuality plays in
social life today. Scholars recognize that sexuality continues to be an important and defining social
location and that the manner in which sexuality is constructed has a significant effect on perceptions,
interactions, and outcomes.
Structural Functionalism
When it comes to sexuality, functionalists stress the importance of regulating sexual behavior to ensure
marital cohesion and family stability. Since functionalists identify the family unit as the most integral

CHAPTER 12 | GENDER, SEX, AND SEXUALITY

component in society, they maintain a strict focus on it at all times and argue in favor of social
arrangements that promote and ensure family preservation.
Functionalists such as Talcott Parsons (1955) have long argued that the regulation of sexual
activity is an important function of the family. Social norms surrounding family life have, traditionally,
encouraged sexual activity within the family unit (marriage) and have discouraged activity outside of it
(premarital and extramarital sex). From a functionalist point of view, the purpose of encouraging sexual
activity in the confines of marriage is to intensify the bond between spouses and to ensure that
procreation occurs within a stable, legally recognized relationship. This structure gives offspring the
best possible chance for appropriate socialization and the provision of basic resources.
From a functionalist standpoint, homosexuality cannot be promoted on a large-scale as an
acceptable substitute for heterosexuality. If this occurred, procreation would eventually cease. Thus,
homosexuality, if occurring predominantly within the population, is dysfunctional to society. This
criticism does not take into account the increasing legal acceptance of same-sex marriage, or the rise in
gay and lesbian couples who choose to bear and raise children through a variety of available resources.
Conflict Theory
From a conflict theory perspective, sexuality is another area in which power differentials are present
and where dominant groups actively work to promote their worldview as well as their economic
interests. Recently, we have seen the debate over the legalization of gay marriage intensify nationwide.
While five states (Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, New Hampshire, and Vermont) and the District of
Columbia have legalized same-sex marriage, 30 states have adopted statutes or constitutional provisions
preventing same-sex marriage. One of these provisions, the Defense of Marriage Act, states that
marriage between one man and one woman is the only domestic legal union that shall be valid or
recognized.
For conflict theorists, there are two key dimensions to the debate over same-sex marriage—one
ideological and the other economic. Dominant groups (in this instance, heterosexuals) wish for their
worldview—which embraces traditional marriage and the nuclear family—to win out over what they
see as the intrusion of a secular, individually driven worldview. On the other hand, many gay and
lesbian activists argue that legal marriage is a fundamental right that cannot be denied based on sexual
orientation and that, historically, there already exists a precedent for changes to marriage laws: the
1960s legalization of formerly forbidden interracial marriages is one example.
From an economic perspective, activists in favor of same-sex marriage point out that legal
marriage brings with it certain entitlements, many of which are financial in nature, like Social Security
benefits and medical insurance (Solmonese 2008). Denial of these benefits to gay couples is wrong,
they argue. Conflict theory suggests that as long as heterosexuals and homosexuals struggle over these
social and financial resources, there will be some degree of conflict.
Symbolic Interactionism
Interactionists focus on the meanings associated with sexuality and with sexual orientation. Since
femininity is devalued in American society, those who adopt such traits are subject to ridicule; this is
especially true for boys or men. Just as masculinity is the symbolic norm, so too has heterosexuality
come to signify normalcy. Prior to 1973, the American Psychological Association (APA) defined
homosexuality as an abnormal or deviant disorder. Interactionist labeling theory recognizes the impact
this has made. Before 1973, the APA was powerful in shaping social attitudes toward homosexuality by
defining it as pathological. Today, the APA cites no association between sexual orientation and
psychopathology and sees homosexuality as a normal aspect of human sexuality (APA 2008).
Interactionists are also interested in how discussions of homosexuals often focus almost
exclusively on the sex lives of gays and lesbians; homosexuals, especially men, may be assumed to be
hypersexual and, in some cases, deviant. Interactionism might also focus on the slurs used to describe
homosexuals. Labels such as “queen” and “fag” are often used to demean homosexual men by
feminizing them. This subsequently affects how homosexuals perceive themselves. Recall Cooley’s
“looking-glass self,” which suggests that self develops as a result of one’s interpretation and evaluation
of the responses of others (Cooley 1902). Constant exposure to derogatory labels, jokes, and pervasive
homophobia would lead to a negative self-image, or worse, self-hate. The CDC reports that homosexual
youths who experience high levels of social rejection are six times more likely to have high levels of
depression and eight times more likely to have attempted suicide (CDC 2011).
Queer Theory
Queer Theory is a perspective that problematizes the manner in which we have been taught to think
about sexual orientation. By calling their discipline “queer,” these scholars are rejecting the effects of

269

270

CHAPTER 12 | GENDER, SEX, AND SEXUALITY

labeling; instead, they embrace the word “queer” and have reclaimed it for their own purposes. Queer
theorists reject the dichotomization of sexual orientations into two mutually exclusive outcomes,
homosexual or heterosexual. Rather, the perspective highlights the need for a more flexible and fluid
conceptualization of sexuality—one that allows for change, negotiation, and freedom. The current
schema used to classify individuals as either “heterosexual” or “homosexual” pits one orientation
against the other. This mirrors other oppressive schemas in our culture, especially those surrounding
gender and race (black versus white, male versus female).
Queer theorist Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick argued against American society’s monolithic definition of
sexuality—against its reduction to a single factor: the sex of one’s desired partner. Sedgwick identified
dozens of other ways in which people’s sexualities were different, such as:
• Even identical genital acts mean very different things to different people.
• Sexuality makes up a large share of the self-perceived identity of some people, a small share of
others’.
• Some people spend a lot of time thinking about sex, others little.
• Some people like to have a lot of sex, others little or none.
• Many people have their richest mental/emotional involvement with sexual acts that they don’t do,
or don’t even want to do.
• Some people like spontaneous sexual scenes, others like highly scripted ones, others like
spontaneous-sounding ones that are nonetheless totally predictable.
• Some people, homo- hetero- and bisexual, experience their sexuality as deeply embedded in a
matrix of gender meanings and gender differentials. Others of each sexuality do not (Sedgwick
1990).
In the end, queer theory strives to question the ways society perceives and experiences sex, gender,
and sexuality, opening the door to new scholarly understanding.
Throughout this chapter we have examined the complexities of gender, sex, and sexuality.
Differentiating between sex, gender, and sexual orientation is an important first step to a deeper
understanding and critical analysis of these issues. Understanding the sociology of sex, gender, and
sexuality will help to build awareness of the inequalities experienced by subordinate groups such as
women, homosexuals, and transgendered individuals.

transsexuals: transgendered individuals who wish to alter their bodies through medical
interventions such as surgery and hormonal therapy

Section Summary
12.1 The Difference Between Sex and Gender
The terms “sex” and “gender” refer to two different identifiers. Sex denotes biological characteristics
differentiating males and females, while gender denotes social and cultural characteristics of masculine
and feminine behavior. Sex and gender are not always synchronous. Individuals who strongly identify
with the opposing gender are considered transgendered.

12.2 Gender
Children become aware of gender roles in their earliest years, and they come to understand and perform
these roles through socialization, which occurs through four major agents: family, education, peer
groups, and mass media. Socialization into narrowly prescribed gender roles results in the stratification
of males and females. Each sociological perspective offers a valuable view for understanding how and
why gender inequality occurs in our society.

12.3 Sex and Sexuality
When studying sex and sexuality, sociologists focus their attention on sexual attitudes and practices, not
on physiology or anatomy. Norms regarding gender and sexuality vary across cultures. In general, the
United States tends to be fairly conservative in its sexual attitudes. As a result, homosexuals continue to
face opposition and discrimination in most major social institutions.

CHAPTER 13 | AGING AND THE ELDERLY

Introduction to Aging and the Elderly
At age 52, Bridget Fisher became a first-time grandmother. She worked in human resources at a
scientific research company, a job she’d held for 20 years. She had raised two children, divorced her
first husband, remarried, and survived a cancer scare.
Her fast-paced job required her to travel around the country, setting up meetings and conferences.
The company did not offer retirement benefits. Bridget had seen many employees put in 10, 15, or 20
years of service only to get laid off when they were considered too old. Because of laws against age
discrimination, the company executives were careful to prevent any records from suggesting age as the
reason for the layoffs.
Seeking to avoid the crisis she would face if she were laid off, Bridget went into action. She took
advantage of the company’s policy to put its employees through college if they continued to work two
years past graduation. Completing evening classes in nursing at the local technical school, she became a
registered nurse after four years. She worked two more years, then quit her job in HR, and accepted a
part-time nursing job at a family clinic. Her new job offered retirement benefits. Bridget no longer had
to travel to work and she was able to spend more time with her family and to cultivate new hobbies.
Today, Bridget Fisher, 62, is a wife, mother of two, grandmother of three, part-time nurse, master
gardener, and quilt club member. She enjoys golfing and camping with her husband and taking her
terriers to the local dog park. She does not expect to retire from the workforce for five or ten more
years, and though the government officially considers her a senior citizen, she doesn’t feel old. In fact,
while bouncing her grandchild on her knee, Bridget tells her daughter, 38, “I never felt younger.”
Age is not merely a number; it represents a wealth of life experiences that shape whom we
become. With medical advancements that prolong human life, old age has taken on a new meaning in
societies with the means to provide high-quality medical care. However, many aspects of the aging
experience depend on social class, race, gender, and other social factors.

13.1 Who Are the Elderly? Aging in Society
Think of American movies and television shows you have watched recently. Did any of them feature
older actors and actresses? What roles did they play? How were these older actors portrayed? Were they
cast as main characters in a love story? Grouchy old people?
Many media portrayals of the elderly reflect negative cultural attitudes toward aging. In the United
States, society tends to glorify youth, associating it with beauty and sexuality. In comedies, the elderly
are often associated with grumpiness or hostility. Rarely do the roles of older people convey the fullness
of life experienced by seniors—as employees, lovers, or the myriad roles they have in real life. What
values does this reflect?
One hindrance to society’s fuller understanding of aging is that people rarely understand the
process of aging until they reach old age themselves. (As opposed to childhood, for instance, which we
can all look back on.) Therefore, myths and assumptions about the elderly and aging are common.
Many stereotypes exist surrounding the realities of being an older adult. While individuals often
encounter stereotypes associated with race and gender and are thus more likely to think critically about
them, many people accept age stereotypes without question (Levy 2002). Each culture has a certain set
of expectations and assumptions about aging, all of which are part of our socialization.
While the landmarks of maturing into adulthood are a source of pride, signs of natural aging can
be cause for shame or embarrassment. Some people try to fight off the appearance of aging with
cosmetic surgery. Although many seniors report that their lives are more satisfying than ever, and their
self-esteem is stronger than when they were young, they are still subject to cultural attitudes that make
them feel invisible and devalued.
Gerontology is a field of science that seeks to understand the process of aging and the challenges
encountered as seniors grow older. Gerontologists investigate age, aging, and the aged. Gerontologists
study what it is like to be an older adult in a society and the ways that aging affects members of a
society. As a multidisciplinary field, gerontology includes the work of medical and biological scientists,
social scientists, and even financial and economic scholars.
Social gerontology refers to a specialized field of gerontology that examines the social (and
sociological) aspects of aging. Researchers focus on developing a broad understanding of the
experiences of people at specific ages, such as mental and physical wellbeing, plus age-specific
concerns such as the process of dying. Social gerontologists work as social researchers, counselors,

CHAPTER 13 | AGING AND THE ELDERLY

community organizers, and service providers for older adults. Because of their specialization, social
gerontologists are in a strong position to advocate for older adults.
Scholars in these disciplines have learned that “aging” reflects not just the physiological process of
growing older, but also our attitudes and beliefs about the aging process. You’ve likely seen online
calculators that promise to determine your “real age” as opposed to your chronological age. These ads
target the notion that people may “feel” a different age than their actual years. Some 60-year-olds feel
frail and elderly, while some 80-year-olds feel sprightly.
Equally revealing is that as people grow older they define “old age” in terms of greater years than
their current age (Logan 1992). Many people want to postpone old age, regarding it as a phase that will
never arrive. Some older adults even succumb to stereotyping their own age group (Rothbaum 1983).
In the United States, the experience of being elderly has changed greatly over the past century. In
the late 1800s and early 1900s, many U.S. households were home to multigenerational families, and the
experiences and wisdom of elders was respected. They offered wisdom and support to their children
and often helped raise their grandchildren (Sweetser 1984).
But in today’s society, with most households confined to the nuclear family, attitudes toward the
elderly have changed. In 2000, the U.S. Census Bureau reported that, of the 105.5 million households in
the country, only about 4 million of them (3.7 percent) were multigenerational (U.S. Census Bureau
2001). It is no longer typical for older relatives to live with their children and grandchildren.
Attitudes toward the elderly have also been affected by large societal changes that have happened
over the past 100 years. Researchers believe industrialization and modernization have contributed
greatly to lowering the power, influence, and prestige the elderly once held.
The elderly have both benefitted and suffered from these rapid social changes. In modern societies,
a strong economy created new levels of prosperity for many people. Health care has become more
widely accessible and medicine has advanced, allowing the elderly to live longer. However, older
people are not as essential to the economic survival of their families and communities as they were in
the past.

Studying Aging Populations

to genetic differences, health habits, hair dyes, Botox, and the like make traditional signs of aging increasingly unreliable. (Photo

Since its creation in 1790, the U.S. Census Bureau has been tracking age in the population. Age is an
important factor to analyze with accompanying demographic figures, such as income and health. The
population pyramid below shows projected age distribution patterns for the next several decades.

279

280

CHAPTER 13 | AGING AND THE ELDERLY

Figure 13.3 This population pyramid shows the age distribution pattern for 2010 and projected patterns for 2030 and 2050
(Graph courtesy of the U.S. Census Bureau).

Statisticians use data to calculate the median age of a population, that is, the number that marks the
halfway point in a group’s age range. In the United States, the median age is about 40 (U.S. Census
Bureau 2010). That means that about half of Americans are under 40 and about half are over 40. This
median age has been increasing, indicating the population as a whole is growing older.
A cohort is a group of people who share a statistical or demographic trait. People belonging to the
same age cohort were born in the same time frame. Understanding a population’s age composition can
point to certain social and cultural factors and help governments and societies plan for future social and
economic challenges. The cohort below compares the age distribution of the United States as a whole to
the indigenous population.
Sociological studies on aging might help explain the difference between Native American age
cohorts and the general population. While Native American societies have a strong tradition of revering
their elders, they also have a lower life expectancy because of lack of access to health care and high
levels of mercury in fish, a traditional part of their diet.

Phases of Aging: The Young-Old, Middle-Old, and Old-Old
In the United States, all people over age 18 are considered adults, but there is a large difference between
a person aged 21 and a person who is 45. More specific breakdowns, such as “young adult” and
“middle-aged adult,” are helpful. In the same way, groupings are helpful in understanding the elderly.
The elderly are often lumped together, grouping everyone over the age of 65. But a 65-year-old’s
experience of life is much different than a 90-year-old’s.
The United States’ older adult population can be divided into three life-stage subgroups: the
young-old (approximately 65–74), the middle-old (ages 75–84), and the old-old (over age 85). Today’s
young-old age group is generally happier, healthier, and financially better off than the young-old of
previous generations. In the United States, people are better able to prepare for aging because resources
are more widely available.
Also, many people are making proactive quality-of-life decisions about their old age while they are
still young. In the past, family members made care decisions when an elderly person reached a health
crisis, often leaving the elderly person with little choice about what would happen. The elderly are now
able to choose housing, for example, that allows them some independence while still providing care
when it is needed. Living wills, retirement planning, and medical power of attorney are other concerns
that are increasingly handled in advance.

CHAPTER 13 | AGING AND THE ELDERLY

The Graying of the United States

Figure 13.4 As senior citizens make up a larger percentage of the United States, the organizations supporting them grow
stronger. (Photo courtesy of Congressman George Miller/flickr)

What does it mean to be elderly? Some define it as an issue of physical health, while others simply
define it by chronological age. The U.S. government, for example, typically classifies people aged 65
years old as elderly, at which point citizens are eligible for federal benefits such as Social Security and
Medicare. The World Health Organization has no standard, other than noting that 65 years old is the
commonly accepted definition in most core nations, but it suggests a cut-off somewhere between 50
and 55 years old for semi-peripheral nations, such as those in Africa (World Health Organization 2012).
AARP (formerly the American Association of Retired Persons) cites 50 as the eligible age of
membership. It is interesting to note AARP’s name change; by taking the word “retired” out of its
name, the organization can broaden its base to any older Americans, not just retirees. This is especially
important now that many people are working to age 70 and beyond.
There is an element of social construction, both local and global, in the way individuals and
nations define who is elderly; that is, the shared meaning of the concept of elderly is created through
interactions among people in society. This is exemplified by the truism that you are only as old as you
feel.
Demographically, the U.S. population over age 65 increased from 3 million in 1900 to 33 million
in 1994 (Hobbs 1994) and to 36.8 million in 2010 (U.S. Census Bureau 2011c). This is a greater than
tenfold increase in the elderly population, compared to a mere tripling of both the total population and
of the population under 65 (Hobbs 1994). This increase has been called “the graying of America,” a
term that describes the phenomenon of a larger and larger percentage of the population getting older
and older. There are several reasons why America is graying so rapidly. One of these is life expectancy:
the average number of years a person born today may expect to live. When reviewing Census Bureau
statistics grouping the elderly by age, it is clear that in the United States, at least, we are living longer.
Between 2000 and 2012, the number of elderly citizens between 90 and 94 increased by more than 30
percent, and the number of elderly citizens 95 to 99 increased by almost 30 percent. Finally, the number
of centenarians (those 100 years or older) increased by 2,910: a mere 5.8 percent, but impressive
nonetheless (Werner 2011).
It is interesting to note that not all Americans age equally. Most glaring is the difference between
men and women; as the graph below shows, women have longer life expectancies than men. In 2010,
there were ninety 65-year-old men per one hundred 65-year-old women. However, there were only
eighty 75-year-old men per one hundred 75-year-old women, and only sixty 85-year-old men per one
hundred 85-year-old women. Nevertheless, as the graph shows, the sex ratio actually increased over
time, indicating that men are closing the gap between their life spans and those of women (U.S. Census
Bureau 2010).

281

Figure 13.5 This U.S. Census graph shows that women live significantly longer than men. However, over the past two
decades, men have narrowed the percentage by which women outlive them. (Graph courtesy of the U.S. Census Bureau)

Baby Boomers
Of particular interest to gerontologists right now is the population of baby boomers, the cohort born
between 1946 and 1964 and just now reaching age 65. Coming of age in the 1960s and early 1970s, the
baby boom generation was the first group of children and teenagers with their own spending power and
therefore their own marketing power (Macunovich 2000). As this group has aged, it has redefined what
it means to be young, middle aged, and, now, old. People in the boomer generation do not want to grow
old the way their grandparents did; the result is a wide range of products designed to ward off the
effects—or the signs—of aging. Previous generations of people over 65 were “old.” Baby boomers are
in “later life” or “the third age” (Gilleard and Higgs 2007).
The baby boom generation is the cohort driving much of the dramatic increase in the over-65
population. The figure below shows a comparison of the U.S. population by age and gender between
2000 and 2010. The biggest bulge in the pyramid (representing the largest population group) moves up
the pyramid over the course of the decade; in 2000, the largest population group was age 35 to 55. In
2010, that group was age 45 to 65, meaning the oldest baby boomers are just reaching the age at which
the U.S. Census considers them elderly. In 2020, we can predict, the baby boom bulge will continue to
rise up the pyramid, making the largest U.S. population group between 65 and 85 years old.

CHAPTER 13 | AGING AND THE ELDERLY

Figure 13.6 In this U.S. Census pyramid chart, the baby boom bulge was aged 35 to 55 in 2000. In 2010, they were aged
45 to 65. (Graph courtesy of the U.S. Census Bureau)

This aging of the baby boom cohort has serious implications for our society. Health care is one of
the areas most impacted by this trend. For years, hand-wringing has abounded about the additional
burden the boomer cohort will place on Medicare, a government-funded program that provides health
care services to people over 65. And indeed, the Congressional Budget Office’s 2008 long-term outlook
report shows that Medicare spending is expected to increase from 3 percent of gross domestic product
(GDP) in 2009 to 8 percent of GDP in 2030, and to 15 percent in 2080 (Congressional Budget Office
2008).
Certainly, as boomers age, they will put increasing burdens on the entire U.S. health care system.
A study from 2008 indicates that medical schools are not producing enough medical professionals who
specialize in treating geriatric patients (Gerontological Society of America 2008). However, other
studies indicate that aging boomers will bring economic growth to the health care industries,
particularly in areas like pharmaceutical manufacturing and home health care services (Bierman 2011).
Further, some argue that many of our medical advances of the past few decades are a result of boomers’
health requirements. Unlike the elderly of previous generations, boomers do not expect that turning 65
means their active lives are over. They are not willing to abandon work or leisure activities, but they
may need more medical support to keep living vigorous lives. This desire of a large group of
over-65-year-olds wanting to continue with a high activity level is driving innovation in the medical
industry (Shaw).
The economic impact of aging boomers is also an area of concern for many observers. Although
the baby boom generation earned more than previous generations and enjoyed a higher standard of
living, they also spent their money lavishly and did not adequately prepare for retirement. According to
a 2008 report from the McKinsey Global Institute, approximately two-thirds of early boomer
households have not accumulated enough savings to maintain their lifestyles. This will have a ripple
effect on the economy as boomers work and spend less (Farrel et al. 2008).
Just as some observers are concerned about the possibility of Medicare being overburdened, Social
Security is considered to be at risk. Social Security is a government-run retirement program funded
primarily through payroll taxes. With enough people paying into the program, there should be enough
money for retirees to take out. But with the aging boomer cohort starting to receive Social Security
benefits, and with fewer workers paying into the Social Security trust fund, economists warn that the
system will collapse by the year 2037. A similar warning came in the 1980s; in response to

283

284

CHAPTER 13 | AGING AND THE ELDERLY

recommendations from the Greenspan Commission, the retirement age (the age at which people could
start receiving Social Security benefits) was raised from 62 to 67 and the payroll tax was increased. A
similar hike in retirement age, perhaps to 70, is a possible solution to the current threat to Social
Security (Reuteman 2010).

Aging around the World

Figure 13.7 Cultural values and attitudes can shape people’s experience of aging. (Photo courtesy of Tom Coppen/flickr)
From 1950 to approximately 2010, the global population of individuals age 65 and older increased
by a range of 5–7 percent (Lee 2009). This percentage is expected to increase and will have a huge
impact on the dependency ratio: the number of productive working citizens to non-productive (young,
disabled, elderly) (Bartram and Roe 2005). One country that will soon face a serious aging crisis is
China, which is on the cusp of an “aging boom”: a period when its elderly population will dramatically
increase. The number of people above age 60 in China today is about 178 million, which amounts to
13.3 percent of its total population (Xuequan 2011). By 2050, nearly a third of the Chinese population
will be age 60 or older, putting a significant burden on the labor force and impacting China’s economic
growth (Bannister, Bloom, and Rosenberg 2010).
As health care improves and life expectancy increases across the world, elder care will be an
emerging issue. Wienclaw (2009) suggests that with fewer working-age citizens available to provide
home care and long-term assisted care to the elderly, the costs of elder care will increase.
Worldwide, the expectation governing the amount and type of elder care varies from culture to
culture. For example, in Asia the responsibility for elder care lies firmly on the family (Yap, Thang, and
Traphagan 2005). This is different from the approach in most Western countries, where the elderly are
considered independent and are expected to tend to their own care. It is not uncommon for family
members to intervene only if the elderly relative requires assistance, often due to poor health. Even
then, caring for the elderly is considered voluntary. In the United States, decisions to care for an elderly
relative are often conditionally based on the promise of future returns, such as inheritance or, in some
cases, the amount of support the elderly provided to the caregiver in the past (Hashimoto 1996).
These differences are based on cultural attitudes toward aging. In China, several studies have
noted the attitude of filial piety (deference and respect to one’s parents and ancestors in all things)as
defining all other virtues (Hsu 1971; Hamilton 1990). Cultural attitudes in Japan prior to approximately
1986 supported the idea that the elderly deserve assistance (Ogawa and Retherford 1993). However,
seismic shifts in major social institutions (like family and economy) have created an increased demand
for community and government care. For example, the increase in women working outside the home
has made it more difficult to provide in-home care to aging parents, leading to an increase in the need
for government-supported institutions (Raikhola and Kuroki 2009).
In the United States, by contrast, many people view caring for the elderly as a burden. Even when
there is a family member able and willing to provide for an elderly family member, 60 percent of family
caregivers are employed outside the home and are unable to provide the needed support. At the same
time, however, many middle-class families are unable to bear the financial burden of “outsourcing”
professional health care, resulting in gaps in care (Bookman and Kimbrel 2011). It is important to note
that even within the United States not all demographic groups treat aging the same way. While most
Americans are reluctant to place their elderly members into out-of-home assisted care, demographically
speaking, the groups least likely to do so are Latinos, African Americans, and Asians (Bookman and
Kimbrel 2011).
Globally, the United States and other core nations are fairly well equipped to handle the demands
of an exponentially increasing elderly population. However, peripheral and semi-peripheral nations face

CHAPTER 13 | AGING AND THE ELDERLY

similar increases without comparable resources. Poverty among elders is a concern, especially among
elderly women. The feminization of the aging poor, evident in peripheral nations, is directly due to the
number of elderly women in those countries who are single, illiterate, and not a part of the labor force
(Mujahid 2006).
In 2002, the Second World Assembly on Aging was held in Madrid, Spain, resulting in the Madrid
Plan, an internationally coordinated effort to create comprehensive social policies to address the needs
of the worldwide aging population. The plan identifies three themes to guide international policy on
aging: 1) publically acknowledging the global challenges caused by, and the global opportunities
created by, a rising global population; 2) empowering the elderly; and 3) linking international policies
on aging to international policies on development (Zelenev 2008).
The Madrid Plan has not yet been successful in achieving all its aims. However, it has increased
awareness of the various issues associated with a global aging population, as well as raising the
international consciousness to the way that the factors influencing the vulnerability of the elderly
(social exclusion, prejudice and discrimination, and a lack of socio-legal protection) overlap with other
developmental issues (basic human rights, empowerment, and participation), leading to an increase in
legal protections (Zelenev 2008).

13.2 The Process of Aging
As human beings grow older, they go through different phases or stages of life. It is helpful to
understand aging in the context of these phases. A life course is the period from birth to death,
including a sequence of predictable life events such as physical maturation. Each phase comes with
different responsibilities and expectations, which of course vary by individual and culture. Children
love to play and learn, looking forward to becoming preteens. As preteens begin to test their
independence, they are eager to become teenagers. Teenagers anticipate the promises and challenges of
adulthood. Adults become focused on creating families, building careers, and experiencing the world as
an independent person. Finally, many adults look forward to old age as a wonderful time to enjoy life
without as much pressure from work and family life. In old age, grandparenthood can provide many of
the joys of parenthood without all the hard work that parenthood entails. And as work responsibilities
abate, old age may be a time to explore hobbies and activities that there was no time for earlier in life.
But for other people, old age is not a phase looked forward to. Some people fear old age and do
anything to “avoid” it, seeking medical and cosmetic fixes for the natural effects of age. These differing
views on the life course are the result of the cultural values and norms into which people are socialized.
Through the phases of the life course, dependence and independence levels change. At birth,
newborns are dependent on caregivers for everything. As babies become toddlers and toddlers become
adolescents and then teenagers, they assert their independence more and more. Gradually, children are
considered adults, responsible for their own lives, although the point at which this occurs is widely
variable among individuals, families, and cultures.
As Riley (1978) notes, the process of aging is a lifelong process and entails maturation and change
on physical, psychological, and social levels. Age, much like race, class, and gender, is a hierarchy in
which some categories are more highly valued than others. For example, while many children look
forward to gaining independence, Packer and Chasteen (2006) suggest that even in children, age
prejudice leads both society and the young to view aging in a negative light. This, in turn, can lead to a
widespread segregation between the old and the young at the institutional, societal, and cultural levels
(Hagestad and Uhlenberg 2006).

Making Connections:

Sociological Research

Dr. Ignatz Nascher and the Birth of Geriatrics
In the early 1900s, a New York physician named Dr. Ignatz Nascher coined the term geriatrics, a
medical specialty focusing on the elderly. He created the word by combining two Greek words:
geron (old man) and iatrikos (medical treatment). Nascher based his work on what he observed as
a young medical student, when he saw many acutely ill elderly people who were diagnosed simply
as “being old.” There was nothing medicine could do, his professors declared, about the syndrome
of “old age.”

285

286

CHAPTER 13 | AGING AND THE ELDERLY

Nascher refused to accept this dismissive view, seeing it as medical neglect. He believed it
was a doctor’s duty to prolong life and relieve suffering whenever possible. In 1914, he published
his views in his book Geriatrics: The Diseases of Old Age and Their Treatment (Clarfield 1990).
Nascher saw the practice of caring for the elderly as separate from the practice of caring for the
young, just as pediatrics (caring for children) is different from caring for grown adults (Clarfield
1990)
Nascher had high hopes for his pioneering work. He wanted to treat the aging, especially
those who were poor and had no one to care for them. Many of the elderly poor were sent to live in
“almshouses,” or public old-age homes (Cole 1993). Conditions were often terrible in these
almshouses, where the aging were often sent and just forgotten.
As hard as it might be to believe today, Nascher’s approach was considered unique. At the
time of Nascher’s death, in 1944, he was disappointed that the field of geriatrics had not made
greater strides. In what ways are the elderly better off today than they were before Nascher’s
ideas?

Biological Changes

Figure 13.8 Aging can be a visible, public experience. Many people recognize the signs of aging and, because of the
meanings that culture assigns to these changes, believe that being older means being in physical decline. Many older people,
however, remain healthy, active, and happy. (Photo courtesy of Pedro Riberio Simoes/flickr)

Each person experiences age-related changes based on many factors. Biological factors such as
molecular and cellular changes are called primary aging, while aging that occurs due to controllable
factors such as lack of physical exercise and poor diet is called secondary aging (Whitbourne and
Whitbourne 2010).
Most people begin to see signs of aging after age 50, when they notice the physical markers of age.
Skin becomes thinner, drier, and less elastic. Wrinkles form. Hair begins to thin and gray. Men prone to
balding start losing hair. The difficulty or relative ease with which people adapt to these changes is
dependent in part on the meaning given to aging by their particular culture. A culture that values
youthfulness and beauty above all else leads to a negative perception of growing old. Conversely, a
culture that reveres the elderly for their life experience and wisdom contributes to a more positive
perception of what it means to grow old.
The effects of aging can feel daunting, and sometimes the fear of physical changes (like declining
energy, food sensitivity, and loss of hearing and vision) is more challenging to deal with than the
changes themselves. The way people perceive physical aging is largely dependent on how they were
socialized. If people can accept the changes in their bodies as a natural process of aging, the changes
will not seem as frightening.
According to the federal Administration on Aging (2011), in 2009 fewer people over 65 assessed
their health as “excellent” or “very good” (41.6 percent) compared to those aged 18–64 (64.4 percent).

CHAPTER 13 | AGING AND THE ELDERLY

Evaluating data from the National Center for Health Statistics and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics,
the Administration on Aging found that from 2006 to 2008, the most frequently reported health issues
for those over 65 included arthritis (50 percent), hypertension (38 percent), heart disease (32 percent),
and cancer (22 percent). Additionally, about 27 percent of people age 60 and older are considered obese
by current medical standards. Parker and Thorslunf (2006) found that while the trend is toward steady
improvement in most disability measures, there is a concomitant increase in functional impairments
(disability) and chronic diseases. At the same time, medical advances have reduced some of the
disabling effects of those diseases (Crimmins 2004).
Some impacts of aging are gender specific. Some of the disadvantages that aging women face rise
from long-standing social gender roles. For example, Social Security favors men over women,
inasmuch as women do not earn Social Security benefits for the unpaid labor they perform as an
extension of their gender roles. In the health care field, elderly female patients are more likely than
elderly men to see their health care concerns trivialized (Sharp 1995) and are more like to have the
health issues labeled psychosomatic (Munch 2004). Another female-specific aspect of aging is that
mass-media outlets often depict elderly females in terms of negative stereotypes and as less successful
than older men (Bazzini and Mclntosh I997).
For men, the process of aging—and society’s response to and support of the experience—may be
quite different. The gradual decrease in male sexual performance that occurs as a result of primary
aging is medicalized and constructed as needing treatment (Marshall and Katz 2002) so that a man may
maintain a sense of youthful masculinity. On the other hand, aging men have fewer opportunities to
assert the masculine identities in the company of other men (e.g., sports participation) (Drummond
1998). And some social scientists have observed that the aging male body is depicted in the Western
world as genderless (Spector-Mersel 2006).

Social and Psychological Changes
Male or female, growing older means confronting the psychological issues that come with entering the
last phase of life. Young people moving into adulthood take on new roles and responsibilities as their
lives expand, but an opposite arc can be observed in old age. What are the hallmarks of social and
psychological change?
Retirement—the idea that one may stop working at a certain age—is a relatively recent idea. Up
until the late 19th century, people worked about 60 hours a week and did so until they were physically
incapable of continuing. Following the American Civil War, veterans receiving pensions were able to
withdraw from the workforce, and the number of working older men began declining. A second large
decline in the number of working men began in the post-World War II era, probably due to the

287

288

CHAPTER 13 | AGING AND THE ELDERLY

availability of Social Security, and a third large decline in the 1960s and 1970s was probably due to the
social support offered by Medicare and the increase in Social Security benefits (Munnell 2011).
In the 21st century, most people hope that at some point they will be able to stop working and
enjoy the fruits of their labor. But do people look forward to this time or do they fear it? When people
retire from familiar work routines, some easily seek new hobbies, interests, and forms of recreation.
Many find new groups and explore new activities, but others may find it more difficult to adapt to new
routines and loss of social roles, losing their sense of self-worth in the process.
Each phase of life has challenges that come with the potential for fear. Erik H. Erikson
(1902–1994), in his view of socialization, broke the typical life span into eight phases. Each phase
presents a particular challenge that must be overcome. In the final stage, old age, the challenge is to
embrace integrity over despair. Some people are unable to successfully overcome the challenge. They
may have to confront regrets, such as being disappointed in their children’s lives or perhaps their own.
They may have to accept that they will never reach certain career goals. Or they must come to terms
with what their career success has cost them, such as time with their family or declining personal
health. Others, however, are able to achieve a strong sense of integrity, embracing the new phase in life.
When that happens, there is tremendous potential for creativity. They can learn new skills, practice new
activities, and peacefully prepare for the end of life.
For some, overcoming despair might entail remarriage after the death of a spouse. A study
conducted by Kate Davidson (2002) reviewed demographic data that asserted men were more likely to
remarry after the death of a spouse, and suggested that widows (the surviving female spouse of a
deceased male partner) and widowers (the surviving male spouse of a deceased female partner)
experience their postmarital lives differently. Many surviving women enjoyed a new sense of freedom,
as many were living alone for the first time. On the other hand, for surviving men, there was a greater
sense of having lost something, as they were now deprived of a constant source of care as well as the
focus on their emotional life.

Aging and Sexuality

Figure 13.10 In Harold and Maude, a 1971 cult classic movie, a 20-something young man falls in love with a 79-year-old
woman. The world reacts in disgust. What is your response to this picture, given that that the two people are meant to be lovers,
not grandmother and grandson? (Photo courtesy of luckyjackson/flickr)

It is no secret that Americans are squeamish about the subject of sex. And when the subject is the
sexuality of elderly people? No one wants to think about it or even talk about it. That fact is part of
what makes 1971’s Harold and Maude so provocative. In this cult favorite film, Harold, an alienated
young man, meets and falls in love with Maude, a 79-year-old woman. What is so telling about the film
is the reaction of his family, priest, and psychologist, who exhibit disgust and horror at such a match.
Although it is difficult to have an open, public national dialogue about aging and sexuality, the
reality is that our sexual selves do not disappear after age 65. People continue to enjoy sex—and not
always safe sex—well into their later years. In fact, some research suggests that as many as one in five
new cases of AIDS occur in adults over 65 (Hillman 2011).
In some ways, old age may be a time to enjoy sex more, not less. For women, the elder years can
bring a sense of relief as the fear of an unwanted pregnancy is removed and the children are grown and
taking care of themselves. However, while we have expanded the number of psycho-pharmaceuticals to
address sexual dysfunction in men, it was not until very recently that the medical field acknowledged
the existence of female sexual dysfunctions (Bryant 2004).

Aging “Out:” LGBT Seniors

Figure 13.11 As same-sex marriage becomes a possibility, many gay and lesbian couples are finally able to tie the
knot—sometimes as seniors—after decades of waiting. (Photo courtesy of Fibonacci Blue/flickr).

How do different groups in our society experience the aging process? Are there any experiences
that are universal, or do different populations have different experiences? An emerging field of
study looks at how lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgendered (LGBT) people experience the aging
process and how their experience differs from that of other groups or the dominant group. This
issue is expanding with the aging of the baby boom generation; not only will aging boomers
represent a huge bump in the general elderly population, but the number of LGBT seniors is
expected to double by 2030 (Fredriksen-Goldsen et al. 2011).
A recent study titled The Aging and Health Report: Disparities and Resilience among
Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Older Adults finds that LGBT older adults have higher
rates of disability and depression than their heterosexual peers. They are also less likely to have a
support system that might provide elder care: a partner and supportive children (FredriksenGoldsen et al. 2011). Even for those LGBT seniors who are partnered, some states do not
recognize a legal relationship between two people of the same sex, reducing their legal protection
and financial options.
As they transition to assisted-living facilities, LGBT people have the added burden of
“disclosure management:” the way they share their sexual and relationship identity. In one case
study, a 78-year-old lesbian lived alone in a long-term care facility. She had been in a long-term
relationship of 32 years and had been visibly active in the gay community earlier in her life.
However, in the long-term care setting, she was much quieter about her sexual orientation. She
“selectively disclosed” her sexual identity, feeling safer with anonymity and silence (Jenkins et al.
2010). A study from the National Senior Citizens Law Center reports that only 22 percent of
LGBT older adults expect they could be open about their sexual orientation or gender identity in a
long-term care facility. Even more telling is the finding that only 16 percent of non-LGBT older
adults expected that LGBT people could be open with facility staff (National Senior Citizens Law
Center 2011).
Same-sex marriage—a civil rights battleground that is being fought in many states—can have
major implications for the way the LGBT community ages. With marriage comes the legal and
financial protection afforded to opposite-sex couples, as well as less fear of exposure and a
reduction in the need to “retreat to the closet” (Jenkins et al. 2010). Changes in this area are
coming slowly, and in the meantime, advocates have many policy recommendations for how to
improve the aging process for LGBT individuals. These recommendations include increasing
federal research on LGBT elders, increasing (and enforcing existing) laws against discrimination,
and amending the federal Family and Medical Leave Act to cover LGBT caregivers (Grant 2009).

CHAPTER 13 | AGING AND THE ELDERLY

Death and Dying

Figure 13.12 A young man sits at the grave of his great-grandmother. (Photo courtesy of Sara Goldsmith/flickr)
For most of human history, the standard of living was significantly lower than it is now. Humans
struggled to survive with few amenities and very limited medical technology. The risk of death due to
disease or accident was high in any life stage, and life expectancy was low. As people began to live
longer, death became associated with old age.
For many teenagers and young adults, losing a grandparent or another older relative can be the first
loss of a loved one they experience. It may be their first encounter with grief, a psychological,
emotional, and social response to the feelings of loss that accompanies death or a similar event.
People tend to perceive death, their own and that of others, based on the values of their culture.
While some may look upon death as the natural conclusion to a long, fruitful life, others may find the
prospect of dying frightening to contemplate. People tend to have strong resistance to the idea of their
own death, and strong emotional reactions of loss to the death of loved ones. Viewing death as a loss, as
opposed to a natural or tranquil transition, is often considered normal in the United States.
What may be surprising is how few studies were conducted on death and dying prior to the 1960s.
Death and dying were fields that had received little attention until a psychologist named Elisabeth
Kübler-Ross began observing people who were in the process of dying. As Kübler-Ross witnessed
people’s transition toward death, she found some common threads in their experiences. She observed
that the process had five distinct stages: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. She
published her findings in a 1969 book called On Death and Dying. The book remains a classic on the
topic today.
Kübler-Ross found that a person’s first reaction to the prospect of dying is denial: This is
characterized by not wanting to believe that he or she is dying, with common thoughts such as “I feel
fine” or “This is not really happening to me.” The second stage is anger, when loss of life is seen as
unfair and unjust. A person then resorts to the third stage, bargaining: trying to negotiate with a higher
power to postpone the inevitable by reforming or changing the way he or she lives. The fourth stage,
psychological depression, allows for resignation as the situation begins to seem hopeless. In the final
stage, a person adjusts to the idea of death and reaches acceptance. At this point, the person can face
death honestly, regarding it as a natural and inevitable part of life, and can make the most of their
remaining time.
The work of Kübler-Ross was eye-opening when it was introduced. It broke new ground and
opened the doors for sociologists, social workers, health practitioners, and therapists to study death and
help those who were facing death. Kübler-Ross’s work is generally considered a major contribution to
thanatology: the systematic study of death and dying.
Of special interests to thanatologists is the concept of “dying with dignity.” Modern medicine
includes advanced medical technology that may prolong life without a parallel improvement to the
quality of life one may have. In some cases, people may not want to continue living when they are in
constant pain and no longer enjoying life. Should patients have the right to choose to die with dignity?
Dr. Jack Kevorkian was a staunch advocate for physician-assisted suicide: the voluntary or physicianassisted use of lethal medication provided by a medical doctor to end one’s life. This right to have a
doctor help a patient die with dignity is controversial. In the United States, Oregon was the first state to
pass a law allowing physician-assisted suicides. In 1997, Oregon instituted the Death with Dignity Act,
which required the presence of two physicians for a legal assisted suicide. This law was successfully

CHAPTER 13 | AGING AND THE ELDERLY

challenged by U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft in 2001, but the appeals process ultimately upheld
the Oregon law. Subsequently, both Montana and Washington have passed similar laws.
The controversy surrounding death with dignity laws is emblematic of the way our society tries to
separate itself from death. Health institutions have built facilities to comfortably house those who are
terminally ill. This is seen as a compassionate act, helping relieve the surviving family members of the
burden of caring for the dying relative. But studies almost universally show that people prefer to die in
their own homes (Lloyd, White, and Sutton 2011). Is it our social responsibility to care for elderly
relatives up until their death? How do we balance the responsibility for caring for an elderly relative
with our other responsibilities and obligations? As our society grows older, and as new medical
technology can prolong life even further, the answers to these questions will develop and change.
The changing concept of hospice is an indicator of our society’s changing view of death. Hospice
is a type of health care that treats terminally ill people when “cure-oriented treatments” are no longer an
option (Hospice Foundation of America 2012b). Hospice doctors, nurses, and therapists receive special
training in the care of the dying. The focus is not on getting better or curing the illness, but on passing
out of this life in comfort and peace. Hospice centers exist as a place where people can go to die in
comfort, and increasingly, hospice services encourage at-home care so that someone has the comfort of
dying in a familiar environment, surrounded by family (Hospice Foundation of America 2012a). While
many of us would probably prefer to avoid thinking of the end of our lives, it may be possible to take
comfort in the idea that when we do approach death in a hospice setting, it is in a familiar, relatively
controlled place.

13.3 Challenges Facing the Elderly
Aging comes with many challenges. The loss of independence is one potential part of the process, as
are diminished physical ability and age discrimination. The term senescence refers to the aging process,
including biological, emotional, intellectual, social, and spiritual changes. This section discusses some
of the challenges we encounter during this process.
As already observed, many older adults remain highly self-sufficient. Others require more care.
Because the elderly typically no longer hold jobs, finances can be a challenge. And due to cultural
misconceptions, older people can be targets of ridicule and stereotypes. The elderly face many
challenges in later life, but they do not have to enter old age without dignity.

Poverty

(b)

(a)

Figure 13.13 While elderly poverty rates showed an improvement trend for decades, the 2008 recession has changed
some older people’s financial futures. Some who had planned a leisurely retirement have found themselves at risk of late-age
destitution. (Photo (a) courtesy of Michael Cohen/flickr; photo (b) courtesy of Alex Proimos/flickr)

For many people in the United States, growing older once meant living with less income. In 1960,
almost 35 percent of the elderly existed on poverty-level incomes. A generation ago, the nation’s oldest
populations had the highest risk of living in poverty.
At the start of the 21st century, the older population was putting an end to that trend. Among
people over 65, the poverty rate fell from 30 percent in 1967 to 9.7 percent in 2008, well below the
national average of 13.2 percent (U.S. Census Bureau 2009). However, with the subsequent recession,
which severely reduced the retirement savings of many while taxing public support systems, how are
the elderly affected? According to the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, the national

291

292

CHAPTER 13 | AGING AND THE ELDERLY

poverty rate among the elderly had risen to 14 percent by 2010 (Urban Institute and Kaiser Commission
2010).
Before the recession hit, what had changed to cause a reduction in poverty among the elderly?
What social patterns contributed to the shift? For several decades, a greater number of women joined
the workforce. More married couples earned double incomes during their working years and saved
more money for their retirement. Private employers and governments began offering better retirement
programs. By 1990, senior citizens reported earning 36 percent more income on average than they did
in 1980; that was five times the rate of increase for people under age 35 (U.S. Census Bureau 2009).
In addition, many people were gaining access to better health care. New trends encouraged people
to live more healthful lifestyles, placing an emphasis on exercise and nutrition. There was also greater
access to information about the health risks of behaviors such as cigarette smoking, alcohol
consumption, and drug use. Because they were healthier, many older people continue to work past the
typical retirement age, providing more opportunity to save for retirement. Will these patterns return
once the recession ends? Sociologists will be watching to see. In the meantime, they are realizing the
immediate impact of the recession on elderly poverty.
During the recession, older people lost some of the financial advantages that they’d gained in the
1980s and 1990s. From October 2007 to October 2009 the values of retirement accounts for people over
age 50 lost 18 percent of their value. The sharp decline in the stock market also forced many to delay
their retirement (Administration on Aging 2009).

Ageism

Figure 13.14 Are these street signs humorous or offensive? What shared assumptions make them humorous? Or is
memory loss too serious to be made fun of? (Photo courtesy of Tumbleweed/flickr)

Driving to the grocery store, Peter, 23, got stuck behind a car on a four-lane main artery through his
city’s business district. The speed limit was 35 miles per hour, and while most drivers sped along at 40
to 45 mph, the driver in front of him was going the minimum speed. Peter tapped on his horn. He
tailgated the driver. Finally, Peter had a chance to pass the car. He glanced over. Sure enough, Peter
thought, a gray-haired old man guilty of “DWE,” driving while elderly.
At the grocery store, Peter waited in the checkout line behind an older woman. She paid for her
groceries, lifted her bags of food into her cart, and toddled toward the exit. Peter, guessing her to be
about 80, was reminded of his grandmother. He paid for his groceries and caught up with her.
“Can I help you with your cart?” he asked.
“No, thank you. I can get it myself,” she said and marched off toward her car.
Peter’s responses to both older people, the driver and the shopper, were prejudiced. In both cases,
he made unfair assumptions. He assumed the driver drove cautiously simply because the man was a
senior citizen, and he assumed the shopper needed help carrying her groceries just because she was an
older woman.
Responses like Peter’s toward older people are fairly common. He didn’t intend to treat people
differently based on personal or cultural biases, but he did. Ageism is discrimination (when someone

CHAPTER 13 | AGING AND THE ELDERLY

acts on a prejudice) based on age. Dr. Robert Butler coined the term in 1968, noting that ageism exists
in all cultures (Brownell). Ageist attitudes and biases based on stereotypes reduce elderly people to
inferior or limited positions.
Ageism can vary in severity. Peter’s attitudes are probably seen as fairly mild, but relating to the
elderly in ways that are patronizing can be offensive. When ageism is reflected in the workplace, in
health care, and in assisted-living facilities, the effects of discrimination can be more severe. Ageism
can make older people fear losing a job, feel dismissed by a doctor, or feel a lack of power and control
in their daily living situations.
In early societies, the elderly were respected and revered. Many preindustrial societies observed
gerontocracy, a type of social structure wherein the power is held by a society’s oldest members. In
some countries today, the elderly still have influence and power and their vast knowledge is respected.
In many modern nations, however, industrialization contributed to the diminished social standing
of the elderly. Today wealth, power, and prestige are also held by those in younger age brackets. The
average age of corporate executives was 59 in 1980. In 2008, the average age had lowered to 54 (Stuart
2008). Some older members of the workforce felt threatened by this trend and grew concerned that
younger employees in higher level positions would push them out of the job market. Rapid
advancements in technology and media have required new skill sets that older members of the
workforce are less likely to have.
Changes happened not only in the workplace but also at home. In agrarian societies, a married
couple cared for their aging parents. The oldest members of the family contributed to the household by
doing chores, cooking, and helping with child care. As economies shifted from agrarian to industrial,
younger generations moved to cities to work in factories. The elderly began to be seen as an expensive
burden. They did not have the strength and stamina to work outside the home. What began during
industrialization, a trend toward older people living apart from their grown children, has become
commonplace.

Mistreatment and Abuse
Mistreatment and abuse of the elderly is a major social problem. As expected, with the biology of
aging, the elderly sometimes become physically frail. This frailty renders them dependent on others for
care—sometimes for small needs like household tasks, and sometimes for assistance with basic
functions like eating and toileting. Unlike a child, who also is dependent on another for care, an elder is
an adult with a lifetime of experience, knowledge, and opinions—a more fully developed person. This
makes the care providing situation more complex.
Elder abuse describes when a caretaker intentionally deprives an older person of care or harms the
person in their charge. Caregivers may be family members, relatives, friends, health professionals, or
employees of senior housing or nursing care. The elderly may be subject to many different types of
abuse.
In a 2009 study on the topic led by Dr. Ron Acierno, the team of researchers identified five major
categories of elder abuse: 1) physical abuse, such as hitting or shaking, 2) sexual abuse including rape
and coerced nudity, 3) psychological or emotional abuse, such as verbal harassment or humiliation, 4)
neglect or failure to provide adequate care, and 5) financial abuse or exploitation (Acierno 2010).
The National Center on Elder Abuse (NCEA), a division of the U.S. Administration on Aging,
also identifies abandonment and self-neglect as types of abuse. Table 13.1 shows some of the signs and
symptoms that the NCEA encourages people to notice.

How prevalent is elder abuse? Two recent U.S. studies found that roughly 1 in 10 elderly people
surveyed had suffered at least one form of elder abuse. Some social researchers believe elder abuse is
underreported and that the number may be higher. The risk of abuse also increases in people with health
issues such as dementia (Kohn and Verhoek-Oftedahl 2011). Older women were found to be victims of
verbal abuse more often than their male counterparts.
In Acierno’s study, which included a sample of 5,777 respondents age 60 and older, 5.2 percent of
respondents reported financial abuse, 5.1 percent said they’d been neglected, and 4.6 endured emotional
abuse (Acierno 2010). The prevalence of physical and sexual abuse was lower at 1.6 and 0.6 percent,
respectively (Acierno 2010).
Other studies have focused on the caregivers to the elderly in an attempt to discover the causes of
elder abuse. Researchers identified factors that increased the likelihood of caregivers perpetrating abuse
against those in their care. Those factors include inexperience, having other demands such as jobs (for
those who weren’t professionally employed as caregivers), caring for children, living full time with the
dependent elder, and experiencing high stress, isolation, and lack of support (Kohn and VerhoekOftedahl 2011).
A history of depression in the caregiver was also found to increase the likelihood of elder abuse.
Neglect was more likely when care was provided by paid caregivers. Many of the caregivers who
physically abused elders were themselves abused—in many cases, when they were children. Family
members with some sort of dependency on the elder in their care were more likely to physically abuse
that elder. For example, an adult child caring for an elderly parent while, at the same time, depending
on some form of income from that parent, would be considered more likely to perpetrate physical abuse
(Kohn and Verhoek-Oftedahl 2011).
A survey in Florida found that 60.1 percent of caregivers reported verbal aggression as a style of
conflict resolution. Paid caregivers in nursing homes were at a high risk of becoming abusive if they
had low job satisfaction, treated the elderly like children, or felt burnt out (Kohn and Verhoek-Oftedahl
2011). Caregivers who tended to be verbally abusive were found to have had less training, lower
education, and higher likelihood of depression or other psychiatric disorders. Based on the results of
these studies, many housing facilities for seniors have increased their screening procedures for
caregiver applicants.

World War II Veterans

Figure 13.15 World War II (1941–1945) veterans and members of an Honor Flight from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, visit
the National World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C. Most of these men and women were in their late teens or 20s
when they served. (Photo courtesy of Sean Hackbarth/flickr)

World War II veterans are aging. Many are in their 80s and 90s. They are dying at an estimated
rate of about 740 per day, according to the U.S. Veterans Administration (National Center for
Veterans Analysis and Statistics 2011). Data suggest that by 2036, there will be no living veterans
of WWII (U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs).
When these veterans came home from the war and ended their service, little was known about
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). These heroes did not receive the mental and physical health
care that could have helped them. As a result, many of them, now in old age, are dealing with the
effects of PTSD. Research suggests a high percentage of World War II veterans are plagued by
flashback memories and isolation, and that many “self-medicate” with alcohol.
Research has found that veterans of any conflict are more than twice as likely as non-veterans
to commit suicide, with rates highest among the oldest veterans. Reports show that WWII-era
veterans are four times as likely to take their own lives as people of the same age with no military
service (Glantz 2010).
In May 2004, the National World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C., was completed and
dedicated to honor those who served during the conflict. Dr. Earl Morse, a physician and retired
Air Force captain, treated many WWII veterans. He encouraged them to visit the memorial,
knowing it could help them heal. Many WWII veterans expressed interest in seeing the memorial.
Unfortunately, many were in their 80s and were neither physically nor financially able to travel on
their own. Dr. Morse arranged to personally escort some of the veterans and enlisted volunteer
pilots who would pay for the flights themselves. He also raised money, insisting the veterans pay
nothing. By the end of 2005, 137 veterans, many in wheelchairs, had made the trip. The Honor
Flight Network was up and running.
As of 2010, the Honor Flight Network had flown more than 120,000 U.S. veterans of World
War II, and some veterans of the Korean War, to Washington. The round-trip flights leave for daylong trips from airports in 30 states, staffed by volunteers who care for the needs of the elderly
travelers (Honor Flight Network 2011).

13.4 Theoretical Perspectives on Aging
What roles do individual senior citizens play in your life? How do you relate to and interact with older
people? What role do they play in neighborhoods and communities, in cities and in states? Sociologists
are interested in exploring the answers to questions such as these through three different perspectives:
functionalism, symbolic interactionism, and conflict theory.

295

296

CHAPTER 13 | AGING AND THE ELDERLY

Functionalism
Functionalists analyze how the parts of society work together. Functionalists gauge how society’s parts
are working together to keep society running smoothly. How does this perspective address aging? The
elderly, as a group, are one of society’s vital parts.
Functionalists find that people with better resources who stay active in other roles adjust better to
old age (Crosnoe and Elder 2002). Three social theories within the functional perspective were
developed to explain how older people might deal with later-life experiences.

Figure 13.16 Does being old mean disengaging from the world? (Photo courtesy of Candida Performa/Wikimedia
Commons)

The earliest gerontological theory in the functionalist perspective is disengagement theory, which
suggests that withdrawing from society and social relationships is a natural part of growing old. There
are several main points to the theory. First, because everyone expects to die one day, and because we
experience physical and mental decline as we approach death, it is natural to withdraw from individuals
and society. Second, as the elderly withdraw, they receive less reinforcement to conform to social
norms. Therefore, this withdrawal allows a greater freedom from the pressure to conform. Finally,
social withdrawal is gendered, meaning it is experienced differently by men and women. Because men
focus on work and women focus on marriage and family, when they withdraw they will be unhappy and
directionless until they adopt a role to replace their accustomed role that is compatible with the
disengaged state (Cummings and Henry 1961).
The suggestion that old age was a distinct state in the life course, characterized by a distinct
change in roles and activities, was groundbreaking when it was first introduced. However, the theory is
no longer accepted in its classic form. Criticisms typically focus on the application of the idea that
seniors universally naturally withdraw from society as they age, and that it does not allow for a wide
variation in the way people experience aging (Hothschild 1975).
The social withdrawal that Cummings and Henry recognized (1961), and its notion that elderly
people need to find replacement roles for those they’ve lost, is addressed anew in activity theory.
According to this theory, activity levels and social involvement are key to this process, and key to
happiness (Havinghurst 1961; Neugarten 1964; Havinghurst, Neugarten, and Tobin 1968). According to
this theory, the more active and involved an elderly person is, the happier he or she will be. Critics of
this theory point out that access to social opportunities and activity are not equally available to all.
Moreover, not everyone finds fulfillment in the presence of others or participation in activities.
Reformulations of this theory suggest that participation in informal activities, such as hobbies, are what
most effect later life satisfaction (Lemon, Bengtson, and Petersen 1972).
According to continuity theory, the elderly make specific choices to maintain consistency in
internal (personality structure, beliefs) and external structures (relationships), remaining active and
involved throughout their elder years. This is an attempt to maintain social equilibrium and stability by
making future decisions on the basis of already developed social roles (Atchley 1971; Atchley 1989).
One criticism of this theory is its emphasis on so-called “normal” aging, which marginalizes those with
chronic diseases such as Alzheimer’s.

The Graying of American Prisons

Figure 13.17 Would you want to spend your retirement here? A growing elderly prison population requires asking
questions about how to deal with senior inmates. (Photo courtesy of Claire Rowland/Wikimedia Commons)

Earl Grimes is a 79-year-old inmate at a state prison. He has undergone two cataract surgeries and
takes about $1,000 a month worth of medication to manage a heart condition. He needs significant
help moving around, which he obtains by bribing younger inmates. He is serving a life prison term
for a murder he committed 38 years—half a lifetime—ago (Warren 2002).
Grimes’ situation exemplifies the problems facing prisons today. According to a recent report
released by Human Rights Watch (2012), there are now more than 124,000 prisoners age 55 or
older and over 26,000 prisoners age 65 or older in the U.S. prison population. These numbers
represent an exponential rise over the last two decades. Why are American prisons graying so
rapidly?
Two factors contribute significantly to this country’s aging prison population. One is the
tough-on-crime reforms of the 1980s and 1990s, when mandatory minimum sentencing and “three
strikes” policies sent many people to jail for 30 years to life, even when the third strike was a
relatively minor offense (Leadership Conference N.d.). Many of today’s elderly prisoners are those
who were incarcerated 30 years ago for life sentences. The other factor influencing today’s aging
prison population is the aging of the overall population. As discussed in the section on aging in the
United States, the percentage of people over 65 is increasing each year due to rising life
expectancies and the aging of the baby boom generation.
So why should it matter that the elderly prison population is growing so swiftly? As discussed
in the section on the process of aging, growing older is accompanied by a host of physical
problems, like failing vision, mobility, and hearing. Chronic illnesses like heart disease, arthritis,
and diabetes also become increasingly common as people age, whether they are in prison or not. In
many cases, elderly prisoners are physically incapable of committing a violent—or possibly
any—crime. Is it ethical to keep them locked up for the short remainder of their lives?
There seem to be a lot of reasons, both financial and ethical, to release some elderly prisoners
to live the rest of their lives—and die—in freedom. However, few lawmakers are willing to appear
soft on crime by releasing convicted felons from prison, especially if their sentence was “life
without parole” (Warren 2002).

Conflict Perspective

public policy and alter the allotment of available resources. (Photo courtesy of longislandwins/flickr)

Theorists working the conflict perspective view society as inherently unstable, an institution that
privileges the powerful wealthy few while marginalizing everyone else. According to the guiding
principle of conflict theory, social groups compete with other groups for power and scarce resources.
Applied to society’s aging population, the principle means that the elderly struggle with other
groups—for example, younger society members—to retain a certain share of resources. At some point,
this competition may become conflict.
For example, some people complain that the elderly get more than their fair share of society’s
resources. In hard economic times, there is great concern about the huge costs of Social Security and
Medicare. One of every four tax dollars, or about 28 percent, is spent on these two programs. In 1950,
the federal government paid $781 million in Social Security payments. Now, the payments are 870
times higher. In 2008, the government paid $296 billion (Statistical Abstract 2011). The medical bills of
the nation’s elderly population are rising dramatically. While there is more care available to certain
segments of the senior community, it must be noted that the financial resources available to the aging
can vary tremendously by race, social class, and gender.
There are three classic theories of aging within the conflict perspective. Modernization theory
(Cowgill and Holmes 1972) suggests that the primary cause of the elderly losing power and influence in
society are the parallel forces of industrialization and modernization. As societies modernize, the status
of elders decreases, and they are increasingly likely to experience social exclusion. Before
industrialization, strong social norms bound the younger generation to care for the older. Now, as
societies industrialize, the nuclear family replaces the extended family. Societies become increasingly
individualistic, and norms regarding the care of older people change. In an individualistic industrial
society, caring for an elderly relative is seen as a voluntary obligation that may be ignored without fear
of social censure.
The central reasoning of modernization theory is that as long as the extended family is the standard
family, as in preindustrial economies, elders will have a place in society and a clearly defined role. As
societies modernize, the elderly, unable to work outside of the home, have less to offer economically
and are seen as a burden. This model may be applied to both the developed and the developing world,
and it suggests that as people age they will be abandoned and lose much of their familial support since
they become a nonproductive economic burden.
Another theory in the conflict perspective is age stratification theory(Riley, Johnson, and Foner
1972). Though it may seem obvious now, with our awareness of ageism, age stratification theorists
were the first to suggest that members of society might be stratified by age, just as they are stratified by
race, class, and gender. Because age serves as a basis of social control, different age groups will have
varying access to social resources such as political and economic power. Within societies, behavioral
age norms, including norms about roles and appropriate behavior, dictate what members of age cohorts
may reasonably do. For example, it might be considered deviant for an elderly woman to wear a bikini
because it violates norms denying the sexuality of older females. These norms are specific to each age
strata, developing from culturally based ideas about how people should “act their age.”
Thanks to amendments to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), which drew
attention to some of the ways in which our society is stratified based on age, U.S. workers no longer
must retire upon reaching a specified age. As first passed in 1967, the ADEA provided protection
against a broad range of age discrimination and specifically addressed termination of employment due

CHAPTER 13 | AGING AND THE ELDERLY

to age, age specific layoffs, advertised positions specifying age limits or preferences, and denial of
health care benefits to those over 65 (U.S. EEOC 2012).
Age stratification theory has been criticized for its broadness and its inattention to other sources of
stratification and how these might intersect with age. For example, one might argue that an older white
male occupies a more powerful role, and is far less limited in his choices, compared to an older white
female based on his historical access to political and economic power.
Finally, exchange theory (Dowd 1975), a rational choice approach, suggests we experience an
increased dependence as we age and must increasingly submit to the will of others because we have
fewer ways of compelling others to submit to us. Indeed, inasmuch as relationships are based on mutual
exchanges, as the elderly become less able to exchange resources, they will see their social circles
diminish. In this model, the only means to avoid being discarded is to engage in resource management,
like maintaining a large inheritance or participating in social exchange systems via child care. In fact,
the theory may depend too much on the assumption that individuals are calculating. It is often criticized
for affording too much emphasis to material exchange and devaluing nonmaterial assets such as love
and friendship.

Figure 13.19 The subculture of aging theory posits that the elderly create their own communities because they have been
excluded from other groups. (Photo courtesy of Icnacio Palomo Duarte/flickr)

Symbolic Interactionism
Generally, theories within the symbolic interactionist perspective focus on how society is created
through the day-to-day interaction of individuals, as well as the way people perceive themselves and
others based on cultural symbols. This microanalytic perspective assumes that if people develop a sense
of identity through their social interactions, their sense of self is dependent on those interactions. A
woman whose main interactions with society make her feel old and unattractive may lose her sense of
self. But a woman whose interactions make her feel valued and important will have a stronger sense of
self and a happier life.
Symbolic interactionists stress that the changes associated with old age, in and of themselves, have
no inherent meaning. Nothing in the nature of aging creates any particular, defined set of attitudes.
Rather, attitudes toward the elderly are rooted in society.
One microanalytical theory is Rose’s (1962) subculture of aging theory, which focuses on the
shared community created by the elderly when they are excluded (due to age), voluntarily or
involuntarily, from participating in other groups. This theory suggests that elders will disengage from
society and develop new patterns of interaction with peers who share common backgrounds and
interests. For example, a group consciousness may develop within such groups as AARP around issues
specific to the elderly like the Medicare “doughnut hole,” focused on creating social and political
pressure to fix those issues. Whether brought together by social or political interests, or even
geographic regions, elders may find a strong sense of community with their new group.
Another theory within the symbolic interaction perspective is selective optimization with
compensation theory. Baltes and Baltes (1990) based their theory on the idea that successful personal
development throughout the life course and subsequent mastery of the challenges associated with
everyday life are based on the components of selection, optimization, and compensation. Though this
happens at all stages in the life course, in the field of gerontology, researchers focus attention on
balancing the losses associated with aging with the gains stemming from the same. Here, aging is a
process and not an outcome, and the goals (compensation) are specific to the individual.
According to this theory, our energy diminishes as we age, and we select (selection) personal goals
to get the most (optimize) for the effort we put into activities, in this way making up for (compensation)

299

300

CHAPTER 13 | AGING AND THE ELDERLY

the loss of a wider range of goals and activities. In this theory, the physical decline postulated by
disengagement theory may result in more dependence, but that is not necessarily negative, as it allows
aging individuals to save their energy for the most meaningful activities. For example, a professor who
values teaching sociology may participate in a phased retirement, never entirely giving up teaching, but
acknowledging personal physical limitations that allow teaching only one or two classes per year.
Swedish sociologist Lars Tornstam developed a symbolic interactionist theory called
gerotranscendence: the idea that as people age, they transcend the limited views of life they held in
earlier times. Tornstam believes that throughout the aging process, the elderly become less self-centered
and feel more peaceful and connected to the natural world. Wisdom comes to the elderly, Tornstam’s
theory states, and as the elderly tolerate ambiguities and seeming contradictions, they let go of conflict,
and develop softer views of right and wrong (Tornstam 2005).
Tornstam does not claim that everyone will achieve wisdom in aging. Some elderly people might
still grow bitter and isolated, feel ignored and left out, or become grumpy and judgmental. Symbolic
interactionists believe that, just as in other phases of life, individuals must struggle to overcome their
own failings and turn them into strengths.

Section Summary
13.1 Who Are the Elderly? Aging in Society
The social study of aging uses population data and cohorts to predict social concerns related to aging
populations. In the United States, the population is increasingly older (called “the graying of America”),
especially due to the baby boomer segment. Global studies on aging reveal a difference in life
expectancy between core and peripheral nations as well as a discrepancy in nations’ preparedness for
the challenges of increasing elderly populations.

13.2 The Process of Aging
Old age affects every aspect of human life: biological, social, and psychological. Although medical
technology has lengthened life expectancies, it cannot eradicate aging and death. Cultural attitudes
shape the way our society views old age and dying, but these attitudes shift and evolve over time.

13.3 Challenges Facing the Elderly
As people enter old age, they face challenges. Ageism, which involves stereotyping and discrimination
against the elderly, leads to misconceptions about their abilities. Although elderly poverty has been
improving for decades, many older people may be detrimentally affected by the 2008 recession. Some
elderly people grow physically frail and, therefore, dependent on caregivers, which increases their risk
of elder abuse.

13.4 Theoretical Perspectives on Aging
The three major sociological perspectives inform the theories of aging. Theories in the functionalist
perspective focus on the role of elders in terms of the functioning of society as a whole. Theories in the

301

302

CHAPTER 13 | AGING AND THE ELDERLY

conflict perspective concentrate on how elders, as a group, are at odds with other groups in society. And
theories in the symbolic interactionist perspective focus on how elders’ identities are created through
their interactions.

Short Answer
13.1 Who Are the Elderly? Aging in Society
1. Baby boomers have been called the “Me Generation.” Do you know any baby boomers? In what way
do they exemplify their generation?
2. What social issues involve age disaggregation (breakdowns into groups) of a population? What kind
of sociological studies would consider age an important factor?
3. Conduct a mini-census by counting the members of your extended family, emphasizing age. Try to
include three or four generations, if possible. Create a table and include total population plus
percentages of each generation. Next, begin to analyze age patterns in your family. What issues are
important and specific to each group? What trends can you predict about your own family over the next
10 years based on this census? For example, how will family members’ needs and interests and
relationships change the family dynamic?

13.2 The Process of Aging
4. Test Elisabeth Kübler-Ross’s five stages of grief. Think of someone or something you have lost. You
might consider the loss of a relationship, possession, or aspect of your self-identity. For example,
perhaps you dissolved a childhood friendship, sold your car, or got a bad haircut. For even a small loss,
did you experience all five stages of grief? If so, how did the expression of each stage manifest? Did the
process happen slowly or rapidly? Did the stages occur out of order? Did you reach acceptance? Try to
recall the experience and analyze your own response to loss. Does your experience facilitate your
empathizing with the elderly?
5. What do you think it will be like to be 10, 20, and 50 years older than you are now? What facts are
your assumptions based on? Are any of your assumptions about getting older false? What kind of
sociological study could you establish to test your assumptions?
6. What is your relationship to aging and to time? Look back on your own life. How much and in what
ways did you change in 10 years and in 20 years? Does a decade seem like a long time or a short time
in a life span? Now apply some of your ideas to the idea of aging. Do you think older people share
similar experiences as they age?

13.3 Challenges Facing the Elderly
7. Make a list of all the biases, generalizations, and stereotypes about elderly people that you have seen
or heard. Include everything, no matter how small or seemingly trivial. Try to rate the items on your
list. Which statements can be considered myths? Which frequently turn into discrimination?
8. Have you known any person who experienced prejudice or discrimination based on age? Think of
someone who has been denied an experience or opportunity simply for being too old. Write the story as
a case study.
9. Think of an older person you know well, perhaps a grandparent, other relative, or neighbor. How
does this person defy certain stereotypes of aging?
10. Older people suffer discrimination, and often, so do teenagers. Compare the discrimination of the
elderly to that of teenagers. What do the groups share in common and how are they different?

13.4 Theoretical Perspectives on Aging
11. Remember Bridget Fisher, the 62-year-old woman from the introduction? Consider her life
experiences from all three sociological points of view. Analyze her situation as if you were a
functionalist, a symbolic interactionist, and a conflict theorist.
12. Which lifestyle do you think is healthiest for aging people—activity, continuity, or disengagement
theories? What are the pros and cons of each theory? Find examples of real people who illustrate the
theories, either from your own experience or your friends’ relationships with older people. Do your
examples show positive or negative aspects of the theory they illustrate?

Introduction to Marriage and Family
Christina and James met in college and have been dating for more than five years. For the past two
years, they have been living together in a condo they purchased jointly. While Christina and James were
confident in their decision to enter into a commitment like a 20-year mortgage, they are unsure if they
want to enter into marriage. The couple had many discussions about marriage and decided that it just
didn’t seem necessary. Wasn’t it only a piece of paper? And didn’t half of all marriages end in divorce?
Neither Christina nor James had seen much success with marriage while growing up. Christina
was raised by a single mother. Her parents never married, and her father has had little contact with the
family since she was a toddler. Christina and her mother lived with her maternal grandmother, who
often served as a surrogate parent. James grew up in a two-parent household until age seven, when his
parents divorced. He lived with his mother for a few years, and then later with his mother and her
boyfriend until he left for college. James remained close with his father who remarried and had a baby
with his new wife.
Recently, Christina and James have been thinking about having children and the subject of
marriage has resurfaced. Christina likes the idea of her children growing up in a traditional family,
while James is concerned about possible marital problems down the road and negative consequences
for the children should that occur. When they shared these concerns with their parents, James’s mom
was adamant that the couple should get married. Despite having been divorced and having a live-in
boyfriend of 15 years, she believes that children are better off when their parents are married.
Christina’s mom believes that the couple should do whatever they want but adds that it would “be nice”
if they wed. Christina and James’s friends told them, married or not married, they would still be a
family.
Christina and James’s scenario may be complicated, but it is representative of the lives of many
young couples today, particularly those in urban areas (Useem 2007). The U.S. Census Bureau reports
that the number of unmarried couples has grown from fewer than one million in the 1970s to 6.4
million in 2008. Cohabitating, but unwed, couples account for 10 percent of all opposite-sex couples in
the United States (U.S. Census Bureau 2008). Some may never choose to wed (Jayson 2008). With
fewer couples marrying, the traditional American family structure is becoming less common.

14.1 What Is Marriage? What Is a Family?

Figure 14.2 The modern concept of family is far more encompassing than in past decades. What do you think constitutes
a family? (Photo (a) courtesy Gareth Williams/flickr; photo (b) courtesy Guillaume Paumier/ Wikimedia Commons)

Marriage and family are key structures in most societies. While the two institutions have historically
been closely linked in American culture, their connection is becoming more complex. The relationship
between marriage and family is an interesting topic of study to sociologists.
What is marriage? Different people define it in different ways. Not even sociologists are able to
agree on a single meaning. For our purposes, we’ll define marriage as a legally recognized social
contract between two people, traditionally based on a sexual relationship and implying a permanence of
the union. In practicing cultural relativism, we should also consider variations, such as whether a legal
union is required (think of “common law” marriage and its equivalents), or whether more than two
people can be involved (consider polygamy). Other variations on the definition of marriage might
include whether spouses are of opposite sexes or the same sex, and how one of the traditional
expectations of marriage (to produce children) is understood today.
Sociologists are interested in the relationship between the institution of marriage and the
institution of family because, historically, marriages are what create a family, and families are the most
basic social unit upon which society is built. Both marriage and family create status roles that are
sanctioned by society.
So what is a family? A husband, a wife, and two children—maybe even a pet—has served as the
model for the traditional American family for most of the 20th century. But what about families that
deviate from this model, such as a single-parent household or a homosexual couple without children?
Should they be considered families as well?
The question of what constitutes a family is a prime area of debate in family sociology, as well as
in politics and religion. Social conservatives tend to define the family in terms of structure with each
family member filling a certain role (like father, mother, or child). Sociologists, on the other hand, tend
to define family more in terms of the manner in which members relate to one another than on a strict
configuration of status roles. Here, we’ll define family as a socially recognized group (usually joined
by blood, marriage, or adoption) that forms an emotional connection and serves as an economic unit of
society. Sociologists identify different types of families based on how one enters into them. A family of
orientation refers to the family into which a person is born. A family of procreation describes one that
is formed through marriage. These distinctions have cultural significance related to issues of lineage.
Drawing on two sociological paradigms, the sociological understanding of what constitutes a
family can be explained by symbolic interactionism as well as functionalism. These two theories
indicate that families are groups in which participants view themselves as family members and act
accordingly. In other words, families are groups in which people come together to form a strong
primary group connection, maintaining emotional ties to one another over a long period of time. Such
families may include groups of close friends or teammates. In addition, the functionalist perspective
views families as groups that perform vital roles for society—both internally (for the family itself) and
externally (for society as a whole). Families provide for one another’s physical, emotional, and social
well-being. Parents care for and socialize children. Later in life, adult children often care for elderly
parents. While interactionism helps us to understand the subjective experience of belonging to a
“family,” functionalism illuminates the many purposes of families and their role in the maintenance of a
balanced society (Parsons and Bales 1956). We will go into more detail about how these theories apply
to family in.

CHAPTER 14 | MARRIAGE AND FAMILY

Challenges Families Face
Americans, as a nation, are somewhat divided when it comes to determining what does and what does
not constitute a family. In a 2010 survey conducted by professors at the University of Indiana, nearly all
participants (99.8 percent) agreed that a husband, wife, and children constitute a family. Ninety-two
percent stated that a husband and a wife without children still constitute a family. The numbers drop for
less traditional structures: unmarried couples with children (83 percent), unmarried couples without
children (39.6 percent), gay male couples with children (64 percent), and gay male couples without
children (33 percent) (Powell et al. 2010). This survey revealed that children tend to be the key
indicator in establishing “family” status: the percentage of individuals who agreed that unmarried
couples and gay couples constitute a family nearly doubled when children were added.
The study also revealed that 60 percent of Americans agreed that if you consider yourself a family,
you are a family (a concept that reinforces an interactionist perspective) (Powell 2010). The
government, however, is not so flexible in its definition of “family.” The U.S. Census Bureau defines a
family as “a group of two people or more (one of whom is the householder) related by birth, marriage,
or adoption and residing together” (U.S. Census Bureau 2010). While this structured definition can be
used as a means to consistently track family-related patterns over several years, it excludes individuals
such as cohabitating unmarried heterosexual and homosexual couples. Legality aside, sociologists
would argue that the general concept of family is more diverse and less structured than in years past.
Society has given more leeway to the design of a family making room for what works for its members
(Jayson 2010).
Family is, indeed, a subjective concept, but it is a fairly objective fact that family (whatever one’s
concept of it may be) is very important to Americans. In a 2010 survey by Pew Research Center in
Washington, D.C., 76 percent of adults surveyed stated that family is “the most important” element of
their life—just one percent said it was “not important” (Pew Research Center 2010). It is also very
important to society. President Ronald Regan notably stated, “The family has always been the
cornerstone of American society. Our families nurture, preserve, and pass on to each succeeding
generation the values we share and cherish, values that are the foundation of our freedoms” (Lee 2009).
While the design of the family may have changed in recent years, the fundamentals of emotional
closeness and support are still present. Most responders to the Pew survey stated that their family today
is at least as close (45 percent) or closer (40 percent) than the family with which they grew up (Pew
Research Center 2010).
Alongside the debate surrounding what constitutes a family is the question of what Americans
believe constitutes a marriage. Many religious and social conservatives believe that marriage can only
exist between man and a woman, citing religious scripture and the basics of human reproduction as
support. Social liberals and progressives, on the other hand, believe that marriage can exist between two
consenting adults—be they a man and a woman, or a woman and a woman—and that it would be
discriminatory to deny such a couple the civil, social, and economic benefits of marriage.

Marriage Patterns
With single parenting and cohabitation (when a couple shares a residence but not a marriage)
becoming more acceptable in recent years, people may be less motivated to get married. In a recent
survey, 39 percent of respondents answered “yes” when asked whether marriage is becoming obsolete
(Pew Research Center 2010). The institution of marriage is likely to continue, but some previous
patterns of marriage will become outdated as new patterns emerge. In this context, cohabitation
contributes to the phenomenon of people getting married for the first time at a later age than was typical
in earlier generations (Glezer 1991). Furthermore, marriage will continue to be delayed as more people
place education and career ahead of “settling down.”
One Partner or Many?
Americans typically equate marriage with monogamy, when someone is married to only one person at
a time. In many countries and cultures around the world, however, having one spouse is not the only
form of marriage. In a majority of cultures (78 percent), polygamy, or being married to more than one
person at a time, is accepted (Murdock 1967), with most polygamous societies existing in northern
Africa and east Asia (Altman and Ginat 1996). Instances of polygamy are almost exclusively in the
form of polygyny. Polygyny refers to a man being married to more than one woman at the same time.
The reverse, when a woman is married to more than one man at the same time, is called polyandry. It
is far less common and only occurs in about one percent of the world’s cultures (Altman and Ginat
1996). The reasons for the overwhelming prevalence of polygamous societies are varied but they often
include issues of population growth, religious ideologies, and social status.

CHAPTER 14 | MARRIAGE AND FAMILY

While the majority of societies accept polygyny, the majority of people do not practice it. Often
fewer than 10 percent (and no more than 25–35 percent) of men in polygamous cultures have more than
one wife; these husbands are often older, wealthy, high-status men (Altman and Ginat 1996). The
average plural marriage involves no more than three wives. Negev Bedouin men in Israel, for example,
typically have two wives, although it is acceptable to have up to four (Griver 2008). As urbanization
increases in these cultures, polygamy is likely to decrease as a result of greater access to mass media,
technology, and education (Altman and Ginat 1996).
In the United States, polygamy is considered by most to be socially unacceptable and it is illegal.
The act of entering into marriage while still married to another person is referred to as bigamy and is
considered a felony in most states. Polygamy in America is often associated with those of the Mormon
faith, although in 1890 the Mormon Church officially renounced polygamy. Fundamentalist Mormons,
such as those in the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (FLDS), on the other
hand, still hold tightly to the historic Mormon beliefs and practices and allow polygamy in their sect.
The prevalence of polygamy among Mormons is often overestimated due to sensational media
stories such as the Yearning for Zion ranch raid in Texas in 2008 and popular television shows such as
HBO’s Big Love and TLC’s Sister Wives. It is estimated that there are about 37,500 fundamentalist
Mormons involved in polygamy in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, but that number has shown
a steady decrease in the last 100 years (Useem 2007).
American Muslims, however, are an emerging group with an estimated 20,000 practicing
polygamy. Again, polygamy among American-Muslims is uncommon and occurs only in approximately
one percent of the population (Useem 2007). For now polygamy among American Muslims has gone
fairly unnoticed by mainstream society, but like fundamentalist Mormons whose practices were off the
public’s radar for decades, they may someday find themselves at the center of social debate.

Residency and Lines of Descent
When considering one’s lineage, most Americans look to both their father’s and mother’s sides. Both
paternal and maternal ancestors are considered part of one’s family. This pattern of tracing kinship is
called bilateral descent. Note that kinship, or one’s traceable ancestry, can be based on blood or
marriage or adoption. Sixty percent of societies, mostly modernized nations, follow a bilateral descent
pattern. Unilateral descent (the tracing of kinship through one parent only) is practiced in the other 40
percent of the world’s societies, with high concentration in pastoral cultures (O’Neal 2006).
There are three types of unilateral descent: patrilineal, which follows the father’s line only;
matrilineal, which follows the mother’s side only; and ambilineal, which follows either the father’s
only or the mother’s side only, depending on the situation. In partrilineal societies, such as those in rural
China and India, only males carry on the family surname. This gives males the prestige of permanent
family membership while females are seen as only temporary members (Harrell 2001). American
society assumes some aspects of partrilineal decent. For instance, most children assume their father’s
last name even if the mother retains her birth name.
In matrilineal societies, inheritance and family ties are traced to women. Matrilineal descent is
common in Native American societies, notably the Crow and Cherokee tribes. In these societies,
children are seen as belonging to the women and, therefore, one’s kinship is traced to one’s mother,

315

316

CHAPTER 14 | MARRIAGE AND FAMILY

grandmother, great grandmother, and so on (Mails 1996). In ambilineal societies, which are most
common in Southeast Asian countries, parents may choose to associate their children with the kinship
of either the mother or the father. This choice maybe based on the desire to follow stronger or more
prestigious kinship lines or on cultural customs such as men following their father’s side and women
following their mother’s side (Lambert 2009).
Tracing one’s line of descent to one parent rather than the other can be relevant to the issue of
residence. In many cultures, newly married couples move in with, or near to, family members. In a
patrilocal residence system it is customary for the wife to live with (or near) her husband’s blood
relatives (or family or orientation). Patrilocal systems can be traced back thousands of years. In a DNA
analysis of 4,600-year-old bones found in Germany, scientists found indicators of patrilocal living
arrangements (Haak et al 2008). Patrilocal residence is thought to be disadvantageous to women
because it makes them outsiders in the home and community; it also keeps them disconnected from
their own blood relatives. In China, where patrilocal and patrilineal customs are common, the written
symbols for maternal grandmother (wáipá) are separately translated to mean “outsider” and “women”
(Cohen 2011).
Similarly, in matrilocal residence systems, where it is customary for the husband to live with his
wife’s blood relatives (or her family of orientation), the husband can feel disconnected and can be
labeled as an outsider. The Minangkabau people, a matrilocal society that is indigenous to the highlands
of West Sumatra in Indonesia, believe that home is the place of women and they give men little power
in issues relating to the home or family (Joseph and Najmabadi 2003). Most societies that use patrilocal
and patrilineal systems are patriarchal, but very few societies that use matrilocal and matrilineal
systems are matriarchal, as family life is often considered an important part of the culture for women,
regardless of their power relative to men.

Stages of Family Life
As we’ve established, the concept of family has changed greatly in recent decades. Historically, it was
often thought that most (certainly many) families evolved through a series of predictable stages.
Developmental or “stage” theories used to play a prominent role in family sociology (Strong and
DeVault 1992). Today, however, these models have been criticized for their linear and conventional
assumptions as well as for their failure to capture the diversity of family forms. While reviewing some
of these once-popular theories, it is important to identify their strengths and weaknesses.
The set of predictable steps and patterns families experience over time is referred to as the family
life cycle. One of the first designs of the family life cycle was developed by Paul Glick in 1955. In
Glick’s original design, he asserted that most people will grow up, establish families, rear and launch
their children, experience an “empty nest” period, and come to the end of their lives. This cycle will
then continue with each subsequent generation (Glick 1989). Glick’s colleague, Evelyn Duvall,
elaborated on the family life cycle by developing these classic stages of family (Strong and DeVault
1992):
Table 14.1 Stage Theory This table shows one example of how a “stage”
theory might categorize the phases a family goes through.

The family life cycle was used to explain the different processes that occur in families over time.
Sociologists view each stage as having its own structure with different challenges, achievements, and
accomplishments that transition the family from one stage to the next. For example, the problems and
challenges that a family experiences in Stage 1 as a married couple with no children are likely much
different than those experienced in Stage 5 as a married couple with teenagers. The success of a family
can be measured by how well they adapt to these challenges and transition into each stage. While

CHAPTER 14 | MARRIAGE AND FAMILY

sociologists use the family life cycle to study the dynamics of family overtime, consumer and
marketing researchers have used it to determine what goods and services families need as they progress
through each stage (Murphy and Staples 1979).
As early “stage” theories have been criticized for generalizing family life and not accounting for
differences in gender, ethnicity, culture, and lifestyle, less rigid models of the family life cycle have
been developed. One example is the family life course, which recognizes the events that occur in the
lives of families but views them as parting terms of a fluid course rather than in consecutive stages
(Strong and DeVault 1992). This type of model accounts for changes in family development, such as
the fact that in today’s society, childbearing does not always occur with marriage. It also sheds light on
other shifts in the way family life is practiced. Society’s modern understanding of family rejects rigid
“stage” theories and is more accepting of new, fluid models.

The Evolution of Television Families
Whether you grew up watching the Cleavers, the Waltons, the Huxtables, or the Simpsons, most of
the iconic families you saw in television sitcoms included a father, a mother, and children
cavorting under the same roof while comedy ensued. The 1960s was the height of the suburban
American nuclear family on television with shows such as The Donna Reed Show and Father
Knows Best. While some shows of this era portrayed single parents (My Three Sons and Bonanza,
for instance), the single status almost always resulted from being widowed, not divorced or unwed.
Although family dynamics in real American homes were changing, the expectations for
families portrayed on television were not. America’s first reality show, An American Family
(which aired on PBS in 1973) chronicled Bill and Pat Loud and their children as a “typical”
American family. During the series, the oldest son, Lance, announced to the family that he was
gay, and at the series’ conclusion, Bill and Pat decided to divorce. Although the Loud’s union was
among the 30 percent of marriages that ended in divorce in 1973, the family was featured on the
cover of the March 12 issue of Newsweek with the title “The Broken Family” (Ruoff 2002).
Less traditional family structures in sitcoms gained popularity in the 1980s with shows such
as Diff’rent Strokes (a widowed man with two adopted African-American sons) and One Day at a
Time (a divorced woman with two teenage daughters). Still, traditional families such as those in
Family Ties and The Cosby Show dominated the ratings. The late 1980s and the 1990s saw the
introduction of the dysfunctional family. Shows such as Roseanne, Married with Children, and The
Simpsons portrayed traditional nuclear families, but in a much less flattering light than those from
the 1960s did (Museum of Broadcast Communications 2011).
Over the past 10 years, the nontraditional family has become somewhat of a tradition in
television. While most situation comedies focus on single men and women without children, those
that do portray families often stray from the classic structure: they include unmarried and divorced
parents, adopted children, gay couples, and multigenerational households. Even those that do
feature traditional family structures may show less-traditional characters in supporting roles, such
as the brothers in the highly rated shows Everybody Loves Raymond and Two and Half Men. Even
wildly popular children’s programs as Disney’s Hannah Montana and The Suite Life of Zack &
Cody feature single parents.
In 2009, ABC premiered an intensely nontraditional family with the broadcast of Modern
Family. The show follows an extended family that includes a divorced and remarried father with
one stepchild, and his biological adult children—one of who is in a traditional two-parent
household, and the other who is a gay man in a committed relationship raising an adopted
daughter. While this dynamic may be more complicated than the typical “modern” family, its
elements may resonate with many of today’s viewers. “The families on the shows aren't as
idealistic, but they remain relatable,” states television critic Maureen Ryan. “The most successful
shows, comedies especially, have families that you can look at and see parts of your family in
them” (Respers France 2010).

CHAPTER 14 | MARRIAGE AND FAMILY

14.2 Variations in Family Life
The combination of husband, wife, and children that 99.8 percent of Americans believes constitutes a
family is not representative of 99.8 percent of U.S. families. According to 2010 census data, only 66
percent of children under age 17 live in a household with two married parents. This is a decrease from
77 percent in 1980 (U.S. Census 2011). This two-parent family structure is known as a nuclear family,
referring to married parents and children as the nucleus, or core, of the group. Recent years have seen a
rise in variations of the nuclear family with the parents not being married. Three percent of children live
with two cohabiting parents (U.S. Census 2011).

Figure 14.4 More than one quarter of American children live in a single-parent household. (Photo courtesy of Ross Griff/

Single Parents
Single-parent households are on the rise. In 2010, 27 percent of children lived with a single parent only,
up from 25 percent in 2008. Of that 27 percent, 23 percent live with their mother and three percent live
with their father. Ten percent of children living with their single mother and 20 percent of children
living with their single father also live with the cohabitating partner of their parent (i.e., boyfriends or
girlfriends).
Stepparents are an additional family element in two-parent homes. Among children living in twoparent households, 9 percent live with a biological or adoptive parent and a stepparent. The majority
(70 percent) of those children live with their biological mother and a stepfather. Family structure has
been shown to vary with the age of the child. Older children (ages 15–17) are less likely to live with
two parents than adolescent children (ages 6–14) or young children (ages 0–5). Older children who do
live with two parents are also more likely to live with stepparents (U.S. Census 2011).
In some family structures a parent is not present at all. In 2010, three million children (4 percent of
all children) lived with a guardian who was neither their biological nor adoptive parent. Of these
children, 54 percent live with grandparents, 21 percent live with other relatives, and 24 percent live
with non-relatives. This family structure is referred to as the extended family, and may include aunts,
uncles, and cousins living in the same home. Foster parents account for about a quarter of non-relatives.
The practice of grandparents acting as parents, whether alone or in combination with the child’s parent,
is becoming widespread among today’s families (De Toledo and Brown 1995). Nine percent of all
children live with a grandparent, and in nearly half of those cases, the grandparent maintains primary
responsibility for the child (U.S. Census 2011). A grandparent functioning as the primary care provider
often results from parental drug abuse, incarceration, or abandonment. Events like these can render the
parent incapable of caring for his or her child.
Changes in the traditional family structure raise questions about how such societal shifts affect
children. U.S. Census statistics have long shown that children living in homes with both parents grow
up with more financial and educational advantages than children who are raised in single-parent homes
(U.S. Census 1997). Parental marital status seems to be a significant indicator of advancement in a
child’s life. Children living with a divorced parent typically have more advantages than children living
with a parent who never married; this is particularly true of children who live with divorced fathers.
This correlates with the statistic that never-married parents are typically younger, have fewer years of

CHAPTER 14 | MARRIAGE AND FAMILY

schooling, and have lower incomes (U.S. Census 1997). Six in ten children living with only their
mother live near or below the poverty level. Of those being raised by single mothers, 69 percent live in
or near poverty compared to 45 percent for divorced mothers (U.S. Census 1997). Though other factors
such as age and education play a role in these differences, it can be inferred that marriage between
parents is generally beneficial for children.

Cohabitation
Living together before or in lieu of marriage is a growing option for many couples. Cohabitation, when
a man and woman live together in a sexual relationship without being married, was practiced by an
estimated 7.5 million people (11.5 percent of the population) in 2010, which shows an increase of 13
percent since 2009 (U.S. Census 2010). This surge in cohabitation is likely due to the decrease in social
stigma pertaining to the practice. In a 2010 National Center for Health Statistics survey, only 38 percent
of the 13,000-person sample thought that cohabitation negatively impacted society (Jayson 2010). Of
those who cohabitate, the majority are non-Hispanic with no high school diploma or GED and grew up
in a single-parent household (U.S. Census 2010).
Cohabitating couples may choose to live together in an effort to spend more time together or to
save money on living costs. Many couples view cohabitation as a “trial run” for marriage. Today,
approximately 28 percent of men and women cohabitated before their first marriage. By comparison, 18
percent of men and 23 percent of women married without ever cohabitating (U.S. Census Bureau
2010). The vast majority of cohabitating relationships eventually result in marriage; only 15 percent of
men and women cohabitate only and do not marry. About one half of cohabitators transition into
marriage within three years (U.S. Census 2010).
While couples may use this time to “work out the kinks” of a relationship before they wed, the
most recent research has found that cohabitation has little effect on the success of a marriage. In fact,
those who do not cohabitate before marriage have slightly better rates of remaining married for more
than 10 years (Jayson 2010). Cohabitation may contribute to the increase in the number of men and
women who delay marriage. The median age for marriage is the highest it has ever been since the U.S.
Census kept records—age 26 for women and age 28 for men (U.S. Census 2010).

Figure 14.5 As shown by this graph of marital status percentages among young adults, more young people are choosing
to delay or opt out of marriage. (U.S. Census Bureau, 2000 Census and American Community Survey)

Same-Sex Couples
The number of same-sex couples has grown significantly in the past decade. The U.S. Census Bureau
reported 594,000 same-sex couple households in the United States, a 50 percent increase from 2000.
This increase is a result of more coupling, the growing social acceptance of homosexuality, and a
subsequent increase in willingness to report it. Nationally, same-sex couple households make up 1
percent of the population, ranging from as little as 0.29 percent in Wyoming to 4.01 percent in the
District of Columbia (U.S. Census 2011). Legal recognition of same-sex couples as spouses is different
in each state, as only six states and the District of Columbia have legalized same-sex marriage. The
2010 U.S. Census, however, allowed same-sex couples to report as spouses regardless of whether their
state legally recognizes their relationship. Nationally, 25 percent of all same-sex households reported
that they were spouses. In states where same-sex marriages are performed, nearly half (42.4 percent) of
same-sex couple households were reported as spouses.
In terms of demographics, same-sex couples are not very different from opposite-sex couples.
Same-sex couple households have an average age of 52 and an average household income of $91,558;
opposite-sex couple households have an average age of 59 and an average household income of

319

320

CHAPTER 14 | MARRIAGE AND FAMILY

$95,075. Additionally, 31 percent of same-sex couples are raising children, not far from the 43 percent
of opposite-sex couples (U.S. Census 2009). Of the children in same-sex couple households, 73 percent
are biological children (of only one of the parents), 21 percent are adopted only, and 6 percent are a
combination of biological and adopted (U.S. Census 2009).
While there is some concern from socially conservative groups regarding the well-being of
children who grow up in same-sex households, research reports that same-sex parents are as effective as
opposite-sex parents. In an analysis of 81 parenting studies, sociologists found no quantifiable data to
support the notion that opposite-sex parenting is any better than same-sex parenting. Children of lesbian
couples, however, were shown to have slightly lower rates of behavioral problems and higher rates of
self-esteem (Biblarz and Stacey 2010).

Staying Single
Gay or straight, a new option for many Americans is simply to stay single. In 2010, there were 99.6
million unmarried individuals over age 18 in the United States, accounting for 44 percent of the total
adult population (U.S. Census 2011). In 2010, never-married individuals in the 25 to 29 age bracket
accounted for 62 percent of women and 48 percent of men, up from 11 percent and 19 percent,
respectively, in 1970 (U.S. Census 2011). Single, or never-married, individuals are found in higher
concentrations in large cities or metropolitan areas, with New York City being one of the highest.
Although both single men and single women report social pressure to get married, women are
subject to greater scrutiny. Single women are often portrayed as unhappy “spinsters” or “old maids”
who cannot find a man to marry them. Single men, on the other hand, are typically portrayed as lifetime
bachelors who cannot settle down or simply “have not found the right girl.” Single women report
feeling insecure and displaced in their families when their single status is disparaged (Roberts 2007).
However, single women older than 35 report feeling secure and happy with their unmarried status, as
many women in this category have found success in their education and careers. In general, women feel
more independent and more prepared to live a large portion of their adult lives without a spouse or
domestic partner than they did in the 1960s (Roberts 2007).
The decision to marry or not to marry can be based a variety of factors including religion and
cultural expectations. Asian individuals are the most likely to marry while African Americans are the
least likely to marry (Venugopal 2011). Additionally, individuals who place no value on religion are
more likely to be unmarried than those who place a high value on religion. For black women, however,
the importance of religion made no difference in marital status (Bakalar 2010). In general, being single
is not a rejection of marriage; rather, it is a lifestyle that does not necessarily include marriage. By age
40, according to census figures, 20 percent of women and 14 of men will have never married (U.S.
Census Bureau 2011).

Sociological Research

Deceptive Divorce Rates
It is often cited that half of all marriages end in divorce. This statistic has made many people
cynical when it comes to marriage, but it is misleading. Let’s take a closer look at the data.

CHAPTER 14 | MARRIAGE AND FAMILY

Using National Center for Health Statistics data from 2003 that show a marriage rate of 7.5
(per 1000 people) and a divorce rate of 3.8, it would appear that exactly one half of all marriages
failed (Hurley 2005). This reasoning is deceptive, however, because instead of tracing actual
marriages to see their longevity (or lack thereof), this compares what are unrelated statistics: that
is, the number of marriages in a given year does not have a direct correlation to the divorces
occurring that same year. Research published in the New York Times took a different
approach—determining how many people had ever been married, and of those, how many later
divorced. The result? According to this analysis, American divorce rates have only gone as high as
41 percent (Hurley 2005). Another way to calculate divorce rates would be through a cohort study.
For instance, we could determine the percentage of marriages that are intact after, say, five or
seven years, compared to marriages that have ended in divorce after five or seven years.
Sociological researchers must remain aware of research methods and how statistical results are
applied. As illustrated, different methodologies and different interpretations can lead to
contradictory, and even misleading, results.

Theoretical Perspectives on Marriage and Family
Sociologists study families on both the macro and micro level to determine how families function.
Sociologists may use a variety of theoretical perspectives to explain events that occur within and
outside of the family.
Functionalism
When considering the role of family in society, functionalists uphold the notion that families are an
important social institution and that they play a key role in stabilizing society. They also note that
family members take on status roles in a marriage or family. The family—and its members—perform
certain functions that facilitate the prosperity and development of society.
Sociologist George Murdock conducted a survey of 250 societies and determined that there are
four universal residual functions of the family: sexual, reproductive, educational, and economic (Lee
1985). According to Murdock, the family (which for him includes the state of marriage) regulates
sexual relations between individuals. He does not deny the existence or impact of premarital or
extramarital sex, but states that the family offers a socially legitimate sexual outlet for adults (Lee
1985). This outlet gives way to reproduction, which is a necessary part of ensuring the survival of
society.
Once children are produced, the family plays a vital role in training them for adult life. As the
primary agent of socialization and enculturation, the family teaches young children the ways of thinking
and behaving that follow social and cultural norms, values, beliefs, and attitudes. Parents teach their
children manners and civility. A well-mannered child reflects a well-mannered parent.
Parents also teach children gender roles. Gender roles are an important part of the economic
function of a family. In each family, there is a division of labor that consists of instrumental and
expressive roles. Men tend to assume the instrumental roles in the family, which typically involve work
outside of the family that provides financial support and establishes family status. Women tend to
assume the expressive roles, which typically involve work inside of the family which provides
emotional support and physical care for children (Crano and Aronoff 1978). According to
functionalists, the differentiation of the roles on the basis of sex ensures that families are well balanced
and coordinated. When family members move outside of these roles, the family is thrown out of
balance and must recalibrate in order to function properly. For example, if the father assumes an
expressive role such as providing daytime care for the children, the mother must take on an
instrumental role such as gaining paid employment outside of the home in order for the family to
maintain balance and function.
Conflict Theory
Conflict theorists are quick to point out that American families have been defined as private entities, the
consequence of which has been to leave family matters to only those within the family. Many
Americans are resistant to government intervention in the family: parents do not want the government
to tell them how to raise their children or to become involved in domestic issues. Conflict theory
highlights the role of power in family life and contends that the family is often not a haven but rather an
arena where power struggles can occur. This exercise of power often entails the performance of family
status roles. Conflict theorists may study conflicts as simple as the enforcement of rules from parent to

321

322

CHAPTER 14 | MARRIAGE AND FAMILY

child, or they may examine more serious issues such as domestic violence (spousal and child), sexual
assault, marital rape, and incest.
The first study of marital power was performed in 1960. Researchers found that the person with
the most access to value resources held the most power. As money is one of the most valuable
resources, men who worked in paid labor outside of the home held more power than women who
worked inside the home (Blood and Wolfe 1960). Conflict theorists find disputes over the division of
household labor to be a common source of marital discord. Household labor offers no wages and,
therefore, no power. Studies indicate that when men do more housework, women experience more
satisfaction in their marriages, reducing the incidence of conflict (Coltrane 2000). In general, conflict
theorists tend to study areas of marriage and life that involve inequalities or discrepancies in power and
authority, as they are reflective of the larger social structure.
Symbolic Interactionism
Interactionists view the world in terms of symbols and the meanings assigned to them (LaRossa and
Reitzes 1993). The family itself is a symbol. To some, it is a father, mother, and children; to others, it is
any union that involves respect and compassion. Interactionists stress that family is not an objective,
concrete reality. Like other social phenomena, it is a social construct that is subject to the ebb and flow
of social norms and ever-changing meanings.
Consider the meaning of other elements of family: “parent” was a symbol of a biological and
emotional connection to a child; with more parent-child relationships developing through adoption,
remarriage, or change in guardianship, the word “parent” today is less likely to be associated with a
biological connection than with whoever is socially recognized as having the responsibility for a child’s
upbringing. Similarly, the terms “mother” and “father” are no longer rigidly associated with the
meanings of caregiver and breadwinner. These meanings are more free-flowing through changing
family roles.
Interactionists also recognize how the family status roles of each member are socially constructed,
playing an important part in how people perceive and interpret social behavior. Interactionists view the
family as a group of role players or “actors” that come together to act out their parts in an effort to
construct a family. These roles are up for interpretation. In the late 19th and early 20th century, a “good
father,” for example, was one who worked hard to provided financial security for his children. Today, a
“good father” is one who takes the time outside of work to promote his children’s emotional well-being,
social skills, and intellectual growth—in some ways, a much more daunting task.

14.3 Challenges Families Face
As the structure of family changes over time, so do the challenges families face. Events like divorce and
remarriage present new difficulties for families and individuals. Other long-standing domestic issues
such as abuse continue to strain the health and stability of today’s families.

Divorce and Remarriage
Divorce, while fairly common and accepted in modern American society, was once a word that would
only be whispered and was accompanied by gestures of disapproval. In 1960, divorce was generally
uncommon, affecting only 9.1 out of every 1,000 married persons. That number more than doubled (to
20.3) by 1975 and peaked in 1980 at 22.6 (Popenoe 2007). Over the last quarter century, divorce rates
have dropped steadily and are now similar to those in 1970. The dramatic increase in divorce rates after
the 1960s has been associated with the liberalization of divorce laws and the shift in societal make up
due to women increasingly entering the workforce (Michael 1978). The decrease in divorce rates can be
attributed to two probable factors: an increase in the age at which people get married, and an increased
level of education among those who marry—both of which have been found to promote greater marital
stability.
Divorce does not occur equally among all Americans; some segments of the American population
are more likely to divorce than others. According the American Community Survey (ACS), men and
women in the Northeast have the lowest rates of divorce at 7.2 and 7.5 per 1,000 people. The South has
the highest rate of divorce at 10.2 for men and 11.1 for women. Divorce rates are likely higher in the
South because marriage rates are higher and marriage occurs at younger-than-average ages in this
region. In the Northeast, the marriage rate is lower and first marriages tend to be delayed; therefore, the
divorce rate is lower (U.S. Census Bureau 2011).
The rate of divorce also varies by race. In a 2009 ACS study, American Indian and Alaskan
Natives reported the highest percentages of currently divorced individuals (12.6 percent) followed by

CHAPTER 14 | MARRIAGE AND FAMILY

blacks (11.5 percent), whites (10.8 percent), Pacific Islanders (8 percent), Latinos (7.8 percent) and
Asians (4.9 percent) (ACS 2011). In general those who marry at a later age, have a college education
have lower rates of divorce.

So what causes divorce? While more young people are choosing to postpone or opt out of
marriage, those who enter into the union do so with the expectation that it will last. A great deal of
marital problems can be related to stress, especially financial stress. According to researchers
participating in the University of Virginia’s National Marriage Project, couples who enter marriage
without a strong asset base (like a home, savings, and a retirement plan) are 70 percent more likely to
be divorced after three years than are couples with at least $10,000 in assets. This is connected to
factors such as age and education level that correlate with low incomes.
The addition of children to a marriage creates added financial and emotional stress. Research has
established that marriages enter their most stressful phase upon the birth of the first child (Popenoe and
Whitehead 2007). This is particularly true for couples who have multiples (twins, triplets, and so on).
Married couples with twins or triplets are 17 percent more likely to divorce than those with children
from single births (McKay 2010). Another contributor to the likelihood of divorce is a general decline
in marital satisfaction over time. As people get older, they may find that their values and life goals no
longer match up with those of their spouse (Popenoe and Whitehead 2004).
Divorce is thought to have a cyclical pattern. Children of divorced parents are 40 percent more
likely to divorce than children of married parents. And when we consider children whose parents
divorced and then remarried, the likelihood of their own divorce rises to 91 percent (Wolfinger 2005).
This might result from being socialized to a mindset that a broken marriage can be replaced rather than
repaired (Wolfinger 2005). That sentiment is also reflected in the finding that when both partners of a
married couple have been previously divorced, their marriage is 90 percent more likely to end in
divorce (Wolfinger 2005).

CHAPTER 14 | MARRIAGE AND FAMILY

Figure 14.7 A study from Radford University indicated that bartenders are among the professions with the highest divorce
rates (38.4 percent). Other traditionally low-wage industries (like restaurant service, custodial employment, and factory work)
are also associated with higher divorce rates. (Aamodt and McCoy 2010). (Photo courtesy of Daniel Lobo/flickr)

People in a second marriage account for approximately 19.3 percent of all married persons, and
those who have been married three or more times account for 5.2 percent (U.S. Census Bureau 2011).
The vast majority (91 percent) of remarriages occur after divorce; only 9 percent occur after death of a
spouse (Kreider 2006). Most men and women remarry within five years of a divorce, with the median
length for men (three years) being lower than for women (4.4 years). This length of time has been fairly
consistent since the 1950s. The majority of those who remarry are between the ages of 25 and 44
(Kreider 2006). The general pattern of remarriage also shows that whites are more likely to remarry
than black Americans.
Marriage the second time around (or third or fourth) can be a very different process than the first.
Remarriage lacks many of the classic courtship rituals of a first marriage. In a second marriage,
individuals are less likely to deal with issues like parental approval, premarital sex, or desired family
size (Elliot 2010). In a survey of households formed by remarriage, a mere 8 percent included only
biological children of the remarried couple. Of the 49 percent of homes that include children, 24
percent included only the woman’s biological children, 3 percent included only the man’s biological
children, and 9 percent included a combination of both spouse’s children (U.S. Census Bureau 2006).
Children of Divorce and Remarriage
Divorce and remarriage can been stressful on partners and children alike. Divorce is often justified by
the notion that children are better off in a divorced family than in a family with parents who do not get
along. However, long-term studies determine that to be generally untrue. Research suggests that while
marital conflict does not provide an ideal childrearing environment, going through a divorce can be
damaging. Children are often confused and frightened by the threat to their family security. They may
feel responsible for the divorce and attempt to bring their parents back together, often by sacrificing
their own well-being (Amato 2000). Only in high-conflict homes do children benefit from divorce and
the subsequent decrease in conflict. The majority of divorces come out of lower-conflict homes, and
children from those homes are more negatively impacted by the stress of the divorce than the stress of
unhappiness in the marriage (Amato 2000). Studies also suggest that stress levels for children are not
improved when a child acquires a stepfamily through marriage. Although there may be increased
economic stability, stepfamilies typically have a high level of interpersonal conflict (McLanahan and
Sandefur 1994).
Children’s ability to deal with a divorce may depend on their age. Research has found that divorce
may be most difficult for school-aged children, as they are old enough to understand the separation but
not old enough to understand the reasoning behind it. Older teenagers are more likely to recognize the
conflict that led to the divorce but may still feel fear, loneliness, guilt, and pressure to choose sides.
Infants and preschool-age children may suffer the heaviest impact from the loss of routine that the
marriage offered (Temke 2006).
Proximity to parents also makes a difference in a child’s well-being after divorce. Boys who live or
have joint arrangements with their fathers show less aggression than those who are raised by their
mothers only. Similarly, girls who live or have joint arrangements with their mothers tend to be more
responsible and mature than those who are raised by their fathers only. Nearly three-fourths of the
children of parents who are divorced live in a household headed by their mother, leaving many boys
without a father figure residing in the home (U.S. Census Bureau 2011b). Still, researchers suggest that
a strong parent-child relationship can greatly improve a child’s adjustment to divorce (Temke 2006).
There is empirical evidence that divorce has not discouraged children in terms of how they view
marriage and family. In a survey conducted by researchers from the University of Michigan, about

CHAPTER 14 | MARRIAGE AND FAMILY

three-quarters of high school seniors said it was “extremely important” to have a strong marriage and
family life. And over half believed it was “very likely” that they would be in a lifelong marriage
(Popenoe and Whitehead 2007). These numbers have continued to climb over the last 25 years.

Violence and Abuse
Violence and abuse are among the most disconcerting of the challenges that today’s families face.
Abuse can occur between spouses, between parent and child, as well as between other family members.
The frequency of violence among families is a difficult to determine because many cases of spousal
abuse and child abuse go unreported. In any case, studies have shown that abuse (reported or not) has a
major impact on families and society as a whole.
Domestic Violence
Domestic violence is a significant social problem in the United States. It is often characterized as
violence between household or family members, specifically spouses. To include unmarried,
cohabitating, and same-sex couples, family sociologists have created the term intimate partner
violence (IPV). Women are the primary victims of intimate partner violence. It is estimated that 1 in 4
women has experienced some form of IPV in her lifetime (compared to 1 in 7 men) (Catalano 2007).
IPV may include physical violence, such as punching, kicking, or other methods of inflicting physical
pain; sexual violence, such as rape or other forced sexual acts; threats and intimidation that imply either
physical or sexual abuse; and emotional abuse, such as harming another’s sense of self-worth through
words or controlling another’s behavior. IPV often starts as emotional abuse and then escalates to other
forms or combinations of abuse (Centers for Disease Control 2012).

Figure 14.8 Thirty percent of women who are murdered are killed by their intimate partner. What does this statistic reveal
about societal patterns and norms concerning intimate relationships and gender roles? (Photo courtesy of Kathy Kimpel/flickr)

In 2010, of IPV acts that involved physical actions against women, 57 percent involved physical
violence only; 9 percent involved rape and physical violence; 14 percent involved physical violence and
stalking; 12 percent involved rape, physical violence, and stalking; and 4 percent involved rape only
(CDC 2011). This is vastly different than IPV abuse patterns for men, which show that nearly all (92
percent) physical acts of IVP take the form of physical violence and fewer than one percent involve
rape alone or in combination (Catalano 2007). IPV affects women at greater rates than men because
women often take the passive role in relationships and may become emotionally dependent on their
partner. Perpetrators of IPV work to establish and maintain such dependence in order to hold power and
control over their victims, making them feel stupid, crazy, or ugly—in some way worthless.
IPV affects different segments of the population at different rates. The rate of IPV for black
women (4.6 per 1,000 persons over the age of 12) is higher than that for white women (3.1). These
numbers have been fairly stable for both racial groups over the last 10 years. However, the numbers
have steadily increased for Native Americans and Alaskan Natives (up to 11.1 for females) (Catalano
2007).
Those who are separated report higher rates of abuse than those with other marital statuses, as
conflict is typically higher in those relationships. Similarly, those who are cohabitating are more likely
than those who are married to experience IPV (Stets and Straus 1990). Other researchers have found
that the rate of IPV doubles for women in low-income disadvantaged areas when compared to IPV
experienced by women who reside in more affluent areas (Benson and Fox 2004). Overall, women ages
20 to 24 are at the greatest risk of nonfatal abuse (Catalano 2007).
Accurate statistics on IPV are difficult to determine, as it is estimated that more than half of
nonfatal IPV goes unreported. It is not until victims choose to report crimes that patterns of abuse are
exposed. Most victims studied stated that abuse had occurred for at least two years prior to their first
report (Carlson, Harris, and Holden 1999).

CHAPTER 14 | MARRIAGE AND FAMILY

Sometimes abuse is reported to police by a third party, but it still may not be confirmed by victims.
A study of domestic violence incident reports found that even when confronted by police about abuse,
29 percent of victims denied that abuse occurred. Surprisingly, 19 percent of their assailants were likely
to admit to abuse (Felson, Ackerman, and Gallagher 2005). According to the National Criminal Victims
Survey, victims cite varied reason why they are reluctant to report abuse, as shown in the table below.
Table 14.3 This chart shows reasons that victims give for why they
fail to report abuse to police authorities (Catalano 2007).

Two-thirds of nonfatal IPV occurs inside of the home and approximately 10 percent occurs at the
home of the victim’s friend or neighbor. The majority of abuse takes place between the hours of 6 p.m.
and 6 a.m, and nearly half (42 percent) involves alcohol or drug use (Catalano 2007). Many perpetrators
of IVP blame alcohol or drugs for their abuse, though studies have shown that alcohol and drugs do not
cause IPV, they may only lower inhibitions (Hanson 2011). IPV has significant long-term effects on
individual victims and on society. Studies have shown that IPV damage extends beyond the direct
physical or emotional wounds. Extended IPV has been linked to unemployment among victims, as
many have difficulty finding or holding employment. Additionally, nearly all women who report
serious domestic problems exhibit symptoms of major depression (Goodwin, Chandler, and Meisel
2003).
Female victims of IPV are also more likely to abuse alcohol or drugs, suffer from eating disorders,
and attempt suicide (Silverman et al. 2001). IPV is indeed something that impacts more than just
intimate partners. In a survey, 34 percent of respondents said they have witnessed IPV, and 59 percent
said that they know a victim personally (Roper Starch Worldwide 1995). Many people want to help IPV
victims but are hesitant to intervene because they feel that it is a personal matter or they fear retaliation
from the abuser—reasons similar to those of victims who do not report IPV.
Child Abuse
Children are among the most helpless victims of abuse. In 2010, there were more than 3.3 million
reports of child abuse involving an estimated 5.9 million children (Child Help 2011). Three-fifths of
child abuse reports are made by professionals, including teachers, law enforcement personal, and social
services staff. The rest are made by anonymous sources, other relatives, parents, friends, and neighbors.
Child abuse may come in several forms, the most common being neglect (78.3 percent), followed
by physical abuse (10.8 percent), sexual abuse (7.6 percent), psychological maltreatment (7.6 percent),
and medical neglect (2.4 percent) (Child Help 2011). Some children suffer from a combination of these
forms of abuse. The majority (81.2 percent) of perpetrators are parents; 6.2 percent are other relatives.
Infants (children less than one year old) were the most victimized population with an incident rate
of 20.6 per 1,000 infants. This age group is particularly vulnerable to neglect because they are entirely
dependent on parents for care. Some parents do not purposely neglect their children; factors such as
cultural values, standard of care in a community, and poverty can lead to hazardous level of neglect. If
information or assistance from public or private services are available and a parent fails to use those
services, child welfare services may intervene (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services).

Infants are also often victims of physical abuse, particularly in the form of violent shaking. This
type of physical abuse is referred to as shaken-baby syndrome, which describes a group of medical
symptoms such as brain swelling and retinal hemorrhage resulting from forcefully shaking or causing
impact to an infant’s head. A baby’s cry is the number one trigger for shaking. Parents may find
themselves unable to soothe a baby’s concerns and may take their frustration out on the child by
shaking him or her violently. Other stress factors such as a poor economy, unemployment, and general
dissatisfaction with parental life may contribute this type of abuse. While there is no official central
registry of shaken-baby syndrome statistics, it is estimated that each year 1,400 babies die or suffer
serious injury from being shaken (Barr 2007).

Making Connections:

Social Policy

& Debate

Corporal Punishment
Physical abuse in children may come in the form of beating, kicking, throwing, choking, hitting
with objects, burning, or other methods. Injury inflicted by such behavior is considered abuse even
if the parent or caregiver did not intend to harm the child. Other types of physical contact that are
characterized as discipline (spanking, for example) are not considered abuse as long as no injury
results (Child Welfare Information Gateway 2008).
This issue is rather controversial among modern-day Americans. While some parents feel that
physical discipline, or corporal punishment, is an effective way to respond to bad behavior, others
feel that it is a form of abuse. According to a poll conducted by ABC News, 65 percent of
respondents approve of spanking and 50 percent said that they sometimes spank their child.
Tendency toward physical punishment may be affected by culture and education. Those who
live in the South are more likely than those who live in other regions to spank their child. Those
who do not have a college education are also more likely to spank their child (Crandall 2011).
Currently, 23 states officially allow spanking in the school system; however, many parents may
object and school officials must follow a set of clear guidelines when administering this type of
punishment (Crandall 2011). Studies have shown that spanking is not an effective form of
punishment and may lead to aggression by the victim, particularly in those who are spanked at a
young age (Berlin 2009).
Child abuse occurs at all socioeconomic and education levels and crosses ethnic and cultural lines.
Just as child abuse is often associated with stresses felt by parents, including financial stress, parents
who demonstrate resilience to these stresses are less likely to abuse (Samuels 2011). Young parents are
typically less capable of coping with stresses, particularly the stress of becoming a new parent. Teenage
mothers are more likely to abuse their children than their older counterparts. As a parent’s age
increases, the risk of abuse decreases. Children born to mothers age 15 or younger are twice as likely to
be abused or neglected by age five than are children born to mothers ages 20–21 (George and Lee
1997).
Drug and alcohol use is also a known contributor to child abuse. Children raised by substance
abusers have a risk of physical abuse three times greater than other kids, and neglect is four times as
prevalent in these families (Child Welfare Information Gateway 2011). Other risk factors include social

327

328

CHAPTER 14 | MARRIAGE AND FAMILY

isolation, depression, low parental education, and a history of being mistreated as a child.
Approximately 30 percent of abused children will later abuse their own children (Child Welfare
Information Gateway 2006).
The long-term effects of child abuse impact the physical, mental, and emotional wellbeing of a
child. Injury, poor health, and mental instability occur at a high rate in this group, with 80 percent
meeting the criteria of one or more psychiatric disorders, such as depression, anxiety, or suicidal
behavior, by age 21. Abused children may also suffer from cognitive and social difficulties. Behavioral
consequences will affect most, but not all, of child abuse victims. Children of abuse are 25 percent
more likely, as adolescents, to suffer from difficulties like poor academic performance and teen
pregnancy, or to engage in behaviors like drug abuse and general delinquency. They are also more
likely to participate in risky sexual acts that increase their chances of contracting a sexually transmitted
disease (Child Welfare Information Gateway 2006). Other risky behaviors include drug and alcohol
abuse. As these consequences can affect the health care, education, and criminal systems, the problems
resulting from child abuse do not just belong to the child and family, but to society as a whole.

Section Summary
14.1 What Is Marriage? What Is a Family?
Sociologists view marriage and families as societal institutions that help create the basic unit of social
structure. Both marriage and a family may be defined differently—and practiced differently—in
cultures across the world. Families and marriages, like other institutions, adapt to social change.

14.2 Variations in Family Life
Americans’ concepts of marriage and family are changing. Increases in cohabitation, same-sex partners,
and singlehood are altering of our ideas of marriage. Similarly, single parents, same-sex parents,
cohabitating parents, and unwed parents are changing our notion of what it means to be a family. While
most children still live in opposite-sex, two-parent, married households, that is no longer viewed as the
only type of nuclear family.

14.3 Challenges Families Face
Today’s families face a variety of challenges, specifically to marital stability. While divorce rates have
decreased in the last 25 years, many family members, especially children, still experience the negative
effects of divorce. Children are also negatively impacted by violence and abuse within the home, with
nearly 6 million children abused each year.

Introduction to Religion
Why do sociologists study religion? For centuries, humankind has sought to understand and explain the
“meaning of life.” Many philosophers believe this contemplation and the desire to understand our place
in the universe are what differentiate humankind from other species. Religion, in one form or another,
has been found in all human societies since human societies first appeared. Archaeological digs have
revealed ritual objects, ceremonial burial sites, and other religious artifacts. Social conflict and even
wars often result from religious disputes. To understand a culture, sociologists must study its religion.
What is religion? Pioneer sociologist Emile Durkheim described it with the ethereal statement that
it consists of “things that surpass the limits of our knowledge” (1915). He went on to elaborate:
Religion is “a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things, that is to say set apart
and forbidden, beliefs and practices which unite into one single moral community, called a church, all
those who adhere to them” (1915). Some people associate religion with places of worship (a synagogue
or church), others with a practice (confession or meditation), and still others with a concept that guides
their daily lives (like dharma or sin). All of these people can agree that religion is a system of beliefs,
values, and practices concerning what a person holds sacred or considers to be spiritually significant.
Religion can also serve as a filter for examining other issues in society and other components of a
culture. For example, after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, it became important for teachers,
church leaders, and the media to educate Americans about Islam to prevent stereotyping and to promote
religious tolerance. Sociological tools and methods, such as surveys, polls, interviews, and analysis of
historical data, can be applied to the study of religion in a culture to help us better understand the role
religion plays in people’s lives and the way it influences society.

15.1 The Sociological Approach to Religion
From the Latin religio (respect for what is sacred) and religare (to bind, in the sense of an obligation),
the term religion describes various systems of belief and practice concerning what people determine to
be sacred or spiritual (Fasching and deChant 2001; Durkheim 1915). Throughout history, and in
societies across the world, leaders have used religious narratives, symbols, and traditions in an attempt
to give more meaning to life and understand the universe. Some form of religion is found in every
known culture, and it is usually practiced in a public way by a group. The practice of religion can
include feasts and festivals, God or gods, marriage and funeral services, music and art, meditation or
initiation, sacrifice or service, and other aspects of culture.
While some people think of religion as something individual because religious beliefs can be
highly personal, religion is also a social institution. Social scientists recognize that religion exists as an
organized and integrated set of beliefs, behaviors, and norms centered on basic social needs and values.
Moreover, religion is a cultural universal found in all social groups. For instance, in every culture,
funeral rites are practiced in some way, although these customs vary between cultures and within
religious affiliations. Despite differences, there are common elements in a ceremony marking a person’s
death, such as announcement of the death, care of the deceased, disposition, and ceremony or ritual.
These universals, and the differences in how societies and individuals experience religion, provide rich
material for sociological study.
In studying religion, sociologists distinguish between what they term the experience, beliefs, and
rituals of a religion. Religious experience refers to the conviction or sensation that one is connected to
“the divine.” This type of communion might be experienced when people are praying or meditating.
Religious beliefs are specific ideas that members of a particular faith hold to be true, such as that Jesus

CHAPTER 15 | RELIGION

Christ was the son of God, or believing in reincarnation. Another illustration of religious beliefs is that
different religions adhere to certain stories of world creation. Religious rituals are behaviors or
practices that are either required or expected of the members of a particular group, such as bar mitzvah
or confession (Barkan and Greenwood 2003).

The History of Religion as a Sociological Concept
In the wake of 19th century European industrialization and secularization, three social theorists
attempted to examine the relationship between religion and society: Émile Durkheim, Max Weber, and
Karl Marx. They are among the founding thinkers of modern sociology.
As stated earlier, French sociologist Émile Durkheim (1858–1917) defined religion as a “unified
system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things” (1915). To him, sacred meant
extraordinary—something that inspired wonder and which seemed connected to the concept of “the
divine.” Durkheim argued that “religion happens” in society when there is a separation between the
profane (ordinary life) and the sacred (1915). A rock, for example, isn’t sacred or profane as it exists.
But if someone makes it into a headstone, or another person uses it for landscaping, it takes on different
meanings—one sacred, one profane.
Durkheim is generally considered the first sociologist who analyzed religion in terms of its societal
impact. Above all, Durkheim believed that religion is about community: It binds people together (social
cohesion), promotes behavior consistency (social control), and offers strength for people during life’s
transitions and tragedies (meaning and purpose). By applying the methods of natural science to the
study of society, he held that the source of religion and morality is the collective mind-set of society and
that the cohesive bonds of social order result from common values in a society. He contended that these
values need to be maintained to maintain social stability.
But what would happen if religion were to decline? This question led Durkheim to posit that
religion is not just a social creation but something that represents the power of society: When people
celebrate sacred things, they celebrate the power of their society. By this reasoning, even if traditional
religion disappeared, society wouldn’t necessarily dissolve.
Whereas Durkheim saw religion as a source of social stability, German sociologist and political
economist Max Weber (1864–1920) believed it was a precipitator of social change. He examined the
effects of religion on economic activities and noticed that heavily Protestant societies—such as those in
the Netherlands, England, Scotland, and Germany—were the most highly developed capitalist societies
and that their most successful business leaders were Protestant. In his writing The Protestant Work
Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (1905), he contends that the Protestant work ethic influenced the
development of capitalism. Weber noted that certain kinds of Protestantism supported the pursuit of
material gain by motivating believers to work hard, be successful, and not spend their profits on
frivolous things. (The modern use of “work ethic” comes directly from Weber’s Protestant ethic,
although it has now lost its religious connotations.)

Making Connections:

Sociological Research

The Protestant Work Ethic in the Information
Age
Max Weber (1904) posited that, in Europe in his time, Protestants were more likely than Catholics
to value capitalist ideology, believing in hard work and savings. He showed that Protestant values
directly influenced the rise of capitalism and helped create the modern world order. Weber thought
the emphasis on community in Catholicism versus the emphasis on individual achievement in
Protestantism made a difference. His century-old claim that the Protestant work ethic led to the
development of capitalism has been one of the most important and controversial topics in the
sociology of religion. In fact, scholars have found little merit to his contention when applied to
modern society (Greeley 1989).
What does the concept of work ethic mean today? The work ethic in the information age has
been affected by tremendous cultural and social change, just as workers in the mid- to late 19th
century were influenced by the wake of the Industrial Revolution. Factory jobs tend to be simple
and uninvolved and require very little thinking or decision making on the part of the worker.

CHAPTER 15 | RELIGION

Today, the work ethic of the modern workforce has been transformed, as more thinking and
decision making is required. Employees also seek autonomy and fulfillment in their jobs, not just
wages. Higher levels of education have become necessary, as well as people management skills
and access to the most recent information on any given topic. The information age has increased
the rapid pace of production expected in many jobs.
On the other hand, the “McDonaldization” of the United States, in which many service
industries, such as the fast-food industry, have established routinized roles and tasks, has resulted
in a “discouragement” of the work ethic. In jobs where roles and tasks are highly prescribed,
workers have no opportunity to make decisions. They are considered replaceable commodities as
opposed to valued employees. During times of recession, these service jobs may be the only
employment possible for younger individuals or those with low-level skills. The pay, working
conditions, and robotic nature of the tasks dehumanizes the workers and strips them of incentives
for doing quality work.
Working hard also doesn’t seem to have any relationship with Catholic or Protestant religious
beliefs anymore, or those of other religions; information age workers expect talent and hard work
to be rewarded by material gain and career advancement.
German philosopher, journalist, and revolutionary socialist Karl Marx (1818–1883) also studied
the social impact of religion. He believed religion reflects the social stratification of society and that it
maintains inequality and perpetuates the status quo. For him, religion was just an extension of workingclass (proletariat) economic suffering. He famously argued that religion is “is the opium of the people”
(1844).
For Durkheim, Weber, and Marx, who were reacting to the great social and economic upheaval of
the late 19th century and early 20th century in Europe, religion was an integral part of society. For
Durkheim, religion was a force for cohesion that helped bind the members of society to the group,
while Weber believed religion could be understood as something separate from society. Marx
considered religion inseparable from the economy and the worker. Religion could not be understood
apart from the capitalist society that perpetuated inequality. Despite their different views, these social
theorists all believed in the centrality of religion to society.

Theoretical Perspectives on Religion

companionship. (Photo courtesy of James Emery/flickr)

Modern-day sociologists often apply one of three major theoretical perspectives. These views offer
different lenses through which to study and understand society: functionalism, symbolic interactionism,
and conflict theory. Let’s explore how scholars applying these paradigms understand religion.
Functionalism
Functionalists contend that religion serves several functions in society. Religion, in fact, depends on
society for its existence, value, and significance, and vice versa. From this perspective, religion serves

CHAPTER 15 | RELIGION

several purposes, like providing answers to spiritual mysteries, offering emotional comfort, and creating
a place for social interaction and social control.
In providing answers, religion defines the spiritual world and spiritual forces, including divine
beings. For example, it helps answer questions like “How was the world created?” “Why do we
suffer?” “Is there a plan for our lives?” and “Is there an afterlife?” As another function, religion
provides emotional comfort in times of crisis. Religious rituals bring order, comfort, and organization
through shared familiar symbols and patterns of behavior.
One of the most important functions of religion, from a functionalist perspective, is the
opportunities it creates for social interaction and the formation of groups. It provides social support and
social networking, offering a place to meet others who hold similar values and a place to seek help
(spiritual and material) in times of need. Moreover, it can foster group cohesion and integration.
Because religion can be central to many people’s concept of themselves, sometimes there is an “in
group” versus “out group” feeling toward other religions in our society or within a particular practice.
On an extreme level, the Inquisition, the Salem witch trials, and anti-Semitism are all examples of this
dynamic. Finally, religion promotes social control: It reinforces social norms such as appropriate styles
of dress, following the law, and regulating sexual behavior.
Conflict Theory
Conflict theorists view religion as an institution that helps maintain patterns of social inequality. For
example, the Vatican has a tremendous amount of wealth, while the average income of Catholic
parishioners is small. According to this perspective, religion has been used to support the “divine right”
of oppressive monarchs and to justify unequal social structures, like India’s caste system.
Conflict theorists are critical of the way many religions promote the idea that one should be
satisfied with existing circumstances because they are divinely ordained. This power dynamic has been
used by Christian institutions for centuries to keep poor people poor, teaching them that they shouldn’t
be concerned with what they lack because their “true” reward (from a religious perspective) will come
after death. Conflict theorists also point out that those in power in a religion are often able to dictate
practices, rituals, and beliefs through their interpretation of religious texts or via proclaimed direct
communication from the divine.

Figure 15.3 Feminist theorists focus on gender inequality and promote leadership roles for women in religion. (Photo

The feminist perspective is a conflict theory view that focuses specifically on gender inequality. In
terms of religion, feminist theorists assert that, although women are typically the ones to socialize
children into a religion, they have traditionally held very few positions of power within religions. A few
religions and religious denominations are more gender equal, but male dominance remains the norm of
most.

341

342

CHAPTER 15 | RELIGION

attempted to explain these behaviors. The theory proposes that people are self-interested, though
not necessarily selfish, and that people make rational choices—choices that can reasonably be
expected to maximize positive outcomes while minimizing negative outcomes. Sociologists Roger
Finke and Rodney Stark (1988) first considered the use of RCT to explain some aspects of
religious behavior, with the assumption that there is a basic human need for religion in terms of
providing belief in a supernatural being, a sense of meaning in life, and belief in life after death.
Religious explanations of these concepts are presumed to be more satisfactory than scientific
explanations, which may help to account for the continuation of strong religious connectedness in
countries such as the United States, despite predictions of some competing theories for a great
decline in religious affiliation due to modernization and religious pluralism.
Another assumption of RCT is that religious organizations can be viewed in terms of “costs”
and “rewards.” Costs are not only monetary requirements, but also include the time, effort, and
commitment demands of any particular religious organization. Rewards are the intangible benefits
in terms of belief and satisfactory explanations about life, death, and the supernatural, as well as
social rewards from membership. RCT proposes that, in a pluralistic society with many religious
options, religious organizations will compete for members, and people will choose between
different churches or denominations in much the same way they select other consumer goods,
balancing costs and rewards in a rational manner. In this framework, RCT also explains the
development and decline of churches, denominations, sects, and even cults; this limited part of the
very complex RCT theory is the only aspect well supported by research data.
Critics of RCT argue that it doesn’t fit well with human spiritual needs, and many sociologists
disagree that the costs and rewards of religion can even be meaningfully measured or that
individuals use a rational balancing process regarding religious affiliation. The theory doesn’t
address many aspects of religion that individuals may consider essential (such as faith) and further
fails to account for agnostics and atheists who don’t seem to have a similar need for religious
explanations. Critics also believe this theory overuses economic terminology and structure, and
point out that terms such as “rational” and “reward” are unacceptably defined by their use; they
would argue that the theory is based on faulty logic and lacks external, empirical support. A
scientific explanation for why something occurs can’t reasonably be supported by the fact that it
does occur. RCT is widely used in economics and to a lesser extent in criminal justice, but the
application of RCT in explaining the religious beliefs and behaviors of people and societies is still
being debated in sociology today.
Symbolic Interactionism
Rising from the concept that our world is socially constructed, symbolic interactionism studies the
symbols and interactions of everyday life. To interactionists, beliefs and experiences are not sacred
unless individuals in a society regard them as sacred. The Star of David in Judaism, the cross in
Christianity, and the crescent and star in Islam are examples of sacred symbols. Interactionists are
interested in what these symbols communicate. Additionally, because interactionists study one-on-one
everyday interactions between individuals, a scholar using this approach might ask questions focused
on this dynamic. The interaction between religious leaders and practitioners, the role of religion in the
banal components of everyday life, and the ways people express religious values in social
interactions—all might be topics of study to an interactionist.

CHAPTER 15 | RELIGION

15.2 World Religions

Figure 15.4 The symbols of 14 religions are depicted here. In no particular order, they include Judaism, Wicca, Taoism,

ReligiousTolerance.org (http://ReligiousTolerance.org) )

The major religions of the world (Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Confucianism, Christianity, Taoism, and
Judaism) differ in many respects, including how each religion is organized and the belief system each
upholds. Other differences include the nature of belief in a higher power, the history of how the world
and the religion began, and the use of sacred texts and objects.

Types of Religious Organizations
Religions organize themselves—their institutions, practitioners, and structures—in a variety of
fashions. For instance, when the Roman Catholic Church emerged, it borrowed many of its
organizational principles from the ancient Roman military, turning senators into cardinals, for example.
Sociologists use different terms, like ecclesia, denomination, and sect, to define these types of
organizations. Scholars are also aware that these definitions are not static. Most religions transition
through different organizational phases. For example, Christianity began as a cult, transformed into a
sect, and today exists as an ecclesia.
Cults, like sects, are new religious groups. In modern America this term often carries pejorative
connotations. However, almost all religions began as cults and gradually progressed to levels of greater
size and organization. The term cult is sometimes used interchangeably with the term new religious
movement (NRM). In its pejorative use, these groups are often disparaged as being secretive, highly
controlling of members’ lives, and dominated by a single, charismatic leader.
Controversy exists over whether some groups are cults, perhaps due in part to media
sensationalism over groups like polygamous Mormons or the Peoples Temple followers who died at
Jonestown, Guyana. Some groups that are controversially labeled as cults today include the Church of
Scientology and the Hare Krishna movement.
A sect is a small and relatively new group. Most of the well-known Christian denominations in the
United States today began as sects. For example, the Methodists and Baptists protested against their
parent Anglican Church in England, just as Henry VIII protested against the Catholic Church by
forming the Anglican Church. From “protest” comes the term Protestant.
Occasionally, a sect is breakaway group that may be in tension with larger society. They
sometimes claim to be returning to “the fundamentals” or to contest the veracity of a particular doctrine.
When membership in a sect increases over time, it may grow into a denomination. Often a sect begins
as an offshoot of a denomination, when a group of members believes they should separate from the
larger group.
Some sects dissolve without growing into denominations. Sociologists call these established
sects. Established sects, such as the Amish or Jehovah’s Witnesses fall halfway between sect and
denomination on the ecclesia–cult continuum because they have a mixture of sect-like and
denomination-like characteristics.

343

344

CHAPTER 15 | RELIGION

A denomination is a large, mainstream religious organization, but it does not claim to be official
or state sponsored. It is one religion among many. For example, Baptist, African Methodist Episcopal,
Catholic, and Seventh-day Adventist are all Christian denominations.
The term ecclesia, originally referring to a political assembly of citizens in ancient Athens, Greece,
now refers to a congregation. In sociology, the term is used to refer to a religious group that most all
members of a society belong to. It is considered a nationally recognized, or official, religion that holds a
religious monopoly and is closely allied with state and secular powers. The United States does not have
an ecclesia by this standard; in fact, this is the type of religious organization that many of the first
colonists came to America to escape.

Figure 15.5 How might you classify the Mennonites? As a cult, a sect, or a denomination? (Photo courtesy of Frenkieb/
flickr)

One way to remember these religious organizational terms is to think of cults, sects,
denominations, and ecclesia representing a continuum, with increasing influence on society, where cults
are least influential and ecclesia are most influential.

Types of Religions
Scholars from a variety of disciplines have strived to classify religions. One widely accepted
categorization that helps people understand different belief systems considers what or who people
worship (if anything). Using this method of classification, religions might fall into one of these basic
categories, as shown in Table 15.1.
Table 15.1 One way scholars have categorized religions is by classifying what or who they
hold to be divine.

Note that some religions may be practiced—or understood—in various categories. For instance,
the Christian notion of the Holy Trinity (God, Jesus, Holy Spirit) defies the definition of monotheism to
some scholars. Similarly, many Westerners view the multiple manifestations of Hinduism’s godhead as
polytheistic, while Hindus might describe those manifestations are a monotheistic parallel to the
Christian Trinity.

CHAPTER 15 | RELIGION

It is also important to note that every society also has nonbelievers, such as atheists, who do not
believe in a divine being or entity, and agnostics, who hold that ultimate reality (such as God) is
unknowable. While typically not an organized group, atheists and agnostics represent a significant
portion of the population. It is important to recognize that being a nonbeliever in a divine entity does
not mean the individual subscribes to no morality. Indeed, many Nobel Peace Prize winners and other
great humanitarians over the centuries would have classified themselves as atheists or agnostics.

The World’s Religions
Religions have emerged and developed across the world. Some have been short-lived, while others
have persisted and grown. In this section, we will explore seven of the world’s major religions.
Hinduism
The oldest religion in the world, Hinduism originated in the Indus River Valley about 4,500 years ago
in what is now modern-day northwest India and Pakistan. It arose contemporaneously with ancient
Egyptian and Mesopotamian cultures. With roughly 1 billion followers, Hinduism is the third-largest of
the world’s religions. Hindus believe in a divine power that can manifest as different entities. Three
main incarnations—Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva—are sometimes compared to the manifestations of the
divine in the Christian Trinity.
Multiple sacred texts, collectively called the Vedas, contain hymns and rituals from ancient India
and are mostly written in Sanskrit. Hindus generally believe in a set of principles called dharma, which
refer to one’s duty in the world that corresponds with “right” actions. Hindus also believe in karma, or
the notion that spiritual ramifications of one’s actions are balanced cyclically in this life or a future life.

weddings and religious festivals. (Photo courtesy of Akash Mazumdar)

Buddhism

and influential Tibetan Buddhist leaders. (Photo courtesy of Nancy Pelosi/flickr)

Buddhism was founded by Siddhartha Gautama around 500 B.C.E. Siddhartha was said to have given
up a comfortable, upper-class life to follow one of poverty and spiritual devotion. At the age of 35, he
famously meditated under a sacred fig tree and vowed not to rise before he achieved enlightenment
(bodhi). After this experience, he became known as Buddha, or “enlightened one.” Followers were
drawn to Buddha’s teachings and the practice of meditation, and he later established a monastic order.

345

CHAPTER 15 | RELIGION

meditation. (Photo courtesy of Prince Roy/flickr)

Buddha’s teachings encourage Buddhists to lead a moral life by accepting the four Noble Truths:
1) life is suffering, 2) suffering arises from attachment to desires, 3) suffering ceases when attachment
to desires ceases, and 4) freedom from suffering is possible by following the “middle way.” The
concept of “middle way” is central to Buddhist thinking, which encourages people to live in the present
and to practice acceptance of others (Smith 1991). Buddhism also tends to deemphasize the role of a
godhead, instead stressing the importance of personal responsibility (Craig 2002).
Confucianism
Confucianism was the official religion of China from 200 B.C.E. until it was officially abolished when
communist leadership discouraged religious practice in 1949. The religion was developed by Kung FuTzu (Confucius), who lived in the sixth and fifth centuries B.C.E. An extraordinary teacher, his
lessons—which were about self-discipline, respect for authority and tradition, and jen (the kind
treatment of every person)—were collected in a book called the Analects.
Some religious scholars consider Confucianism more of a social system than a religion because it
focuses on sharing wisdom about moral practices but doesn’t involve any type of specific worship; nor
does it have formal objects. In fact, its teachings were developed in context of problems of social
anarchy and a near-complete deterioration of social cohesion. Dissatisfied with the social solutions put
forth, Kung Fu-Tzu developed his own model of religious morality to help guide society (Smith 1991).
Taoism
In Taoism, the purpose of life is inner peace and harmony. Tao is usually translated as “way” or “path.”
The founder of the religion is generally recognized to be a man named Laozi, who lived sometime in
the sixth century B.C.E. in China. Taoist beliefs emphasize the virtues of compassion and moderation.
The central concept of tao can be understood to describe a spiritual reality, the order of the
universe, or the way of modern life in harmony with the former two. The ying-yang symbol and the
concept of polar forces are central Taoist ideas (Smith 1991). Some scholars have compared this
Chinese tradition to its Confucian counterpart by saying that “whereas Confucianism is concerned with
day-to-day rules of conduct, Taoism is concerned with a more spiritual level of being” (Feng and
English 1972).
Judaism
After their Exodus from Egypt in the 13th century B.C.E., Jews, a nomadic society, became
monotheistic, worshipping only one God. The Jews’ covenant, or promise of a special relationship with
Yahweh (God), is an important element of Judaism, and their sacred text is the Torah, which Christians
also follow as the first five books of the Bible. Talmud refers to a collection of sacred Jewish oral
interpretation of the Torah. Jews emphasize moral behavior and action in this world as opposed to
beliefs or personal salvation in the next world.

CHAPTER 15 | RELIGION

Islam

Figure 15.9 The Islamic house of worship is called a mosque. (Photo courtesy of David Stanley/flickr)
Islam is monotheistic religion and it follows the teaching of the prophet Muhammad, born in Mecca,
Saudi Arabia, in 570 C.E. Muhammad is seen only as a prophet, not as a divine being, and he is
believed to be the messenger of Allah (God), who is divine. The followers of Islam, whose U.S.
population is projected to double in the next 20 years (Pew Research Forum 2011), are called Muslims.
Islam means “peace” and “submission.” The sacred text for Muslims is the Qur’an (or Koran). As
with Christianity’s Old Testament, many of the Qur’an stories are shared with the Jewish faith.
Divisions exist within Islam, but all Muslims are guided by five beliefs or practices, often called
“pillars”: 1) Allah is the only god and Muhammad is his prophet, 2) daily prayer, 3) helping those in
poverty, 4) fasting as a spiritual practice, and 5) pilgrimage to the holy center of Mecca.

Figure 15.10 One of the tenets of Muslim practice concerns journeying to the religion’s most sacred place, Mecca. (Photo

Christianity
Today the largest religion in the world, Christianity began 2,000 years ago in Palestine, with Jesus of
Nazareth, a charismatic leader who taught his followers about caritas (charity) or treating others as you
would like to be treated yourself.
The sacred text for Christians is the Bible. While Jews, Christians, and Muslims share many of
same historical religious stories, their beliefs verge. In their shared sacred stories, it is suggested that the
son of God—a messiah—will return to save God’s followers. While Christians believe that he already
appeared in the person of Jesus Christ, Jews and Muslims disagree. While they recognize Christ as an
important historical figure, their traditions don’t believe he’s the son of God, and their faiths see the
prophecy of the messiah’s arrival as not yet fulfilled.
Different Christian groups have variations among their sacred texts. For instance, Mormons, an
established Christian sect, also use the Book of Mormon, which they believe details other parts of
Christian doctrine and Jesus’ life that aren’t included in the Bible. Similarly, the Catholic Bible includes
the Apocrypha, a collection that, while part of the 1611 King James translation, is no longer included in
Protestant versions of the Bible. Although monotheistic, Christians often describe their god through
three manifestations that they call the Holy Trinity: the father (God), the son (Jesus), and the Holy
Spirit. The Holy Spirit is a term Christians often use to describe religious experience, or how they feel
the presence of the sacred in their lives. One foundation of Christian doctrine is the Ten
Commandments, which decry acts considered sinful, including theft, murder, and adultery.

15.3 Religion in the United States
In examining the state of religion in the United States today, we see the complexity of religious life in
our society, plus emerging trends like the rise of the megachurch, secularization, and the role of religion
in social change.

Religion and Social Change
Religion has historically been an impetus to social change. The translation of sacred texts into everyday,
non-scholarly language empowered people to shape their religions. Disagreements between religious
groups and instances of religious persecution have led to wars and genocides. The United States is no
stranger to religion as an agent of social change. In fact, our nation’s first European arrivals were acting
largely on religious convictions when they were compelled to settle in America.

Liberation Theology
Liberation theology began as a movement within the Roman Catholic Church in the 1950s and 1960s
in Latin America, and it combines Christian principles with political activism. It uses the church to
promote social change via the political arena, and it is most often seen in attempts to reduce or
eliminate social injustice, discrimination, and poverty. A list of proponents of this kind of social justice
(although some pre-date liberation theory) could include Francis of Assisi, Leo Tolstoy, Martin Luther
King Jr., and Desmond Tutu.
Although begun as a moral reaction against the poverty caused by social injustice in that part of
the world, today liberation theology is an international movement that encompasses many churches and
denominations. Liberation theologians discuss theology from the point of view of the poor and the
oppressed, and some interpret the scriptures as a call to action against poverty and injustice. In Europe
and North America, feminist theology has emerged from liberation theology, as a movement to bring
social justice to women.

Religious Leaders and the Rainbow of Gay
Pride
What happens when a religious leader officiates a gay marriage against denomination policies?
What about when that same minister defends the action in part by coming out and making her own
lesbian relationship known to the church?
In the case of the Reverend Amy DeLong, it meant a church trial. Some leaders in her
denomination assert that homosexuality is incompatible with their faith, while others feel this type
of discrimination has no place in a modern church (Barrick 2011).
As the LBGT community increasingly advocates for, and earns, basic civil rights, how will
religious communities respond? Many religious groups have traditionally discounted LBGT
sexualities as “wrong.” However, these organizations have moved closer to respecting human
rights by, for example, increasingly recognizing females as an equal gender. The Roman Catholic
Church drew controversial attention to this issue in 2010 when the Vatican secretary of state
suggested homosexuality was in part to blame for pedophilic sexual abuse scandals that have
plagued the church (Beck 2010). Because numerous studies have shown there to be no relationship
between homosexuality and pedophilia, nor a higher incidence of pedophilia among homosexuals
than among heterosexuals (Beck 2010), the Vatican’s comments seem suspect.
No matter the situation, most religions have a tenuous (at best) relationship with practitioners
and leaders in the gay community. As one of the earliest Christian denominations to break barriers
by ordaining women to serve as pastors, will Amy DeLong’s United Methodist denomination also
be a leader in LBGT rights within Christian churchgoing society?

CHAPTER 15 | RELIGION

Megachurches
A megachurch is a Christian church that has a very large congregation averaging more than 2,000
people who attend regular weekly services. As of 2009, the largest megachurch in the United States was
in Houston Texas, boasting an average weekly attendance of more than 43,000 (Bogan 2009).
Megachurches exist in other parts of the world, especially in South Korea, Brazil, and several African
countries, but the rise of the megachurch in the United States is a fairly recent phenomenon that has
developed primarily in California, Florida, Georgia, and Texas.
Since 1970 the number of megachurches in this country has grown from about 50 to more than
1,000, most of which are attached to the Southern Baptist denomination (Bogan 2009). Approximately
6 million people are members of these churches (Bird and Thumma 2011). The architecture of these
church buildings often resembles a sport or concert arena. The church may include jumbotrons (largescreen televisual technology usually used in sports arenas to show close-up shots of an event). Worship
services feature contemporary music with drums and electric guitars and use state-of-the-art sound
equipment. The buildings sometimes include food courts, sports and recreation facilities, and
bookstores. Services such as child care and mental health counseling are often offered.
Typically, a single, highly charismatic pastor leads the megachurch; at present, all are male. Some
megachurches and their preachers have a huge television presence, and viewers all around the country
watch and respond to their shows and fundraising.
Besides size, U.S. megachurches share other traits, including conservative theology, evangelism,
use of technology and social networking (Facebook, Twitter, podcasts, blogs), hugely charismatic
leaders, few financial struggles, multiple sites, and predominantly white membership. They list their
main focuses as youth activities, community service, and study of the Scripture (Hartford Institute for
Religion Research b).
Critics of megachurches believe they are too large to promote close relationships among fellow
church members or the pastor, as could occur in smaller houses of worship. Supporters note that, in
addition to the large worship services, congregations generally meet in small groups and some
megachurches have informal events throughout the week to allow for community-building (Hartford
Institute for Religion Research a).

Secularization
Historical sociologists Émile Durkheim, Max Weber, and Karl Marx and psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud
anticipated secularization, claiming that the modernization of society would bring about a decrease in
the influence of religion. Weber believed membership in distinguished clubs would outpace
membership in Protestant sects as a way for people to gain authority or respect.
Conversely, some people contend that secularization is a root cause of many social problems, such
as divorce, drug use, and educational downturn. Presidential contender Michele Bachmann even linked
Hurricane Irene and the 2011 earthquake felt in Washington D.C. to politicians’ failure to listen to God
(Ward 2011).
While some scholars see the United States becoming increasingly secular, others observe a rise in
fundamentalism. Compared to other democratic, industrialized countries, the U.S. is generally
perceived to be a fairly religious nation. Whereas 65 percent of Americans in a 2009 Gallup survey said
religion was an important part of their daily lives, the numbers were lower in Spain (49 percent),
Canada (42 percent), France (30 percent), the United Kingdom (27 percent), and Sweden (17 percent)
(Crabtree and Pelham 2009). Secularization interests social observers because it entails a pattern of
change in a fundamental social institution.

Thank God for That Touchdown: Separation of

Imagine three public universities with football games scheduled on Saturday. At University A, a
group of students in the stands who share the same faith decide to form a circle amid the spectators

350

CHAPTER 15 | RELIGION

to pray for the team. For 15 minutes, people in the circle share their prayers aloud among their
group. At University B, the team ahead at halftime decides to join together in prayer, giving thanks
and seeking support from God. This lasts for the first 10 minutes of halftime on the sidelines of the
field while spectators watch. At University C, the game program includes, among its opening
moments, two minutes set aside for the team captain to share a prayer of his choosing with
spectators.
In the tricky area of separation of church and state, which of these actions is allowed and
which is forbidden? In these three fictional scenarios, the last example is against the law while the
first two situations are perfectly acceptable.
In the United States, a nation founded on the principles of religious freedom (many settlers
were escaping religious persecution in Europe), how stringently do we adhere to this ideal? How
well do we respect people’s right to practice any belief system of their choosing? The answer just
might depend on what religion you practice.
In 2003, for example, a lawsuit escalated in Alabama regarding a monument to the Ten
Commandments in a public building. In response, a poll was conducted by USA Today, CNN, and
Gallup. Among the findings: 70 percent of people approved of a Christian Ten Commandments
monument in public, while only 33 percent approved of a monument to the Islamic Qur’an in the
same space. Similarly, survey respondents showed a 64 percent approval of social programs run by
Christian organizations, but only 41 percent approved of the same programs run by Muslim groups
(Newport 2003).
These statistics suggest that, for most Americans, freedom of religion is less important than
the religion under discussion. And this is precisely the point made by those who argue for
separation of church and state. According to their contention, any state-sanctioned recognition of
religion suggests endorsement of one belief system at the expense of all others—contradictory to
the idea of freedom of religion.
So what violates separation of church and state and what is acceptable? A myriad of lawsuits
continue to contribute to the answer. In the case of the three fictional examples above, the issue of
spontaneity is key, as is the existence (or lack thereof) of planning on the part of event organizers.
The next time you’re at a state event—political, public school, community—and the topic of
religion comes up, consider where it falls in this debate.

CHAPTER 15 | RELIGION

religion: a system of beliefs, values, and practices concerning what a person holds to be sacred or
spiritually significant
religious beliefs: specific ideas that members of a particular faith hold to be true
religious experience: the conviction or sensation that one is connected to “the divine”
religious rituals: behaviors or practices that are either required for or expected of the members of
a particular group
sect: a small, new offshoot of a denomination
totemism: belief in a divine connection between humans and other natural beings

Section Summary
15.1 The Sociological Approach to Religion
Religion describes the beliefs, values, and practices related to sacred or spiritual concerns. Social
theorist Émile Durkheim defined religion as a “unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred
things” (1915). Max Weber believed religion could be a force for social change. Karl Marx viewed
religion as a tool used by capitalist societies to perpetuate inequality. Religion is a social institution
because it includes beliefs and practices that serve the needs of society. Religion is also an example of a
cultural universal because it is found in all societies in one form or another. Functionalism, conflict
theory, and interactionism all provide valuable ways for sociologists to understand religion.

15.2 World Religions
Sociological terms for different kinds of religious organizations are, in order of decreasing influence in
society, ecclesia, denomination, sect, and cult. Religions can be categorized according to what or whom
its followers worship. Some of the major, and oldest, of the world’s religions include Hinduism,
Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, Judaism, Islam, and Christianity.

15.3 Religion in the United States
Liberation theology combines Christian principles with political activism to address social injustice,
discrimination, and poverty. Megachurches are those with a membership of more than 2,000 regular
attendees, and they are a vibrant, growing and highly influential segment of American religious life.
Some sociologists believe levels of religiosity in the United States are declining (called secularization),
while others observe a rise in fundamentalism.

Short Answer
15.1 The Sociological Approach to Religion
1. List some ways that you see religion having social control in the everyday world.
2. What are some sacred items that you’re familiar with? Are there some objects, such as cups, candles,
or clothing, that would be considered profane in normal settings but are considered sacred in special
circumstances or when used in specific ways?
3. Consider a religion that you are familiar with and discuss some of its beliefs, behaviors, and norms.
Discuss how these meet social needs. Then research a religion that you don’t know much about.
Explain how its beliefs, behaviors, and norms are like/unlike the other religion.

15.2 World Religions
4. Consider the different types of religious organizations in America. What role did ecclesia play in the
history of the United States? How have sects tended to change over time? What role do cults have
today?
5. What is your understanding of monotheism versus polytheism? How might your ideology be an
obstacle to understanding the theism of another religion you’re unfamiliar with?
6. In American society, do you believe there is social stratification that correlates with religious beliefs?
What about within the practitioners of a given religion? Provide examples to illustrate your point.

Introduction to Education
From the moment a child is born, his or her education begins. At first, education is an informal process
in which an infant watches others and imitates them. As the infant grows into a young child, the process
of education becomes more formal through play dates and preschool. Once in grade school, academic
lessons become the focus of education as a child moves through the school system. But even then,
education is about much more than the simple learning of facts.
Our education system also socializes us to our society. We learn cultural expectations and norms,
which are reinforced by our teachers, our textbooks, and our classmates. (For students outside the
dominant culture, this aspect of the education system can pose significant challenges.) You might
remember learning your multiplication tables in second grade and also learning the social rules of
taking turns on the swings at recess. You might recall learning about the U.S. Constitution in an
American Government course as well as learning when and how to speak up in class.
Schools also can be agents of change, teaching individuals to think outside of the family norms
into which they were born. Educational environments can broaden horizons and even help to break
cycles of poverty and racism.

CHAPTER 16 | EDUCATION

Of course, America’s schools are often criticized—for not producing desired test results, or for
letting certain kids slip through the cracks. In all, sociologists understand education to be both a social
problem and a social solution—and a rich area of study.

16.1 Education around the World

tests. (Photo courtesy of kodomut/flickr)

Education is a social institution through which a society’s children are taught basic academic
knowledge, learning skills, and cultural norms. Every nation in the world is equipped with some form
of education system, though those systems vary greatly. The major factors affecting education systems
are the resources and money that are utilized to support those systems in different nations. As you
might expect, a country’s wealth has much to do with the amount of money spent on education.
Countries that do not have such basic amenities as running water are unable to support robust education
systems or, in many cases, any formal schooling at all. The result of this worldwide educational
inequality is a social concern for many countries, including the United States.
International differences in education systems are not solely a financial issue. The value placed on
education, the amount of time devoted to it, and the distribution of education within a country also play
a role in those differences. For example, students in South Korea spend 220 days a year in school,
compared to the 180 days a year of their United States counterparts (Pellissier 2010). As of 2006, the
United States ranked fifth among 27 countries for college participation, but ranked 16th in the number
of students who receive college degrees (National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education
2006). These statistics may be related to how much time is spent on education in the United States.
Then there is the issue of educational distribution within a nation. In December 2010, the results of
a test called the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), which is administered to
15-year-old students worldwide, were released. Those results showed that students in the United States
had fallen from 15th to 25th in the rankings for science and math (National Public Radio 2010).
Students at the top of the rankings hailed from Shanghai, Finland, Hong Kong, and Singapore.
Analysts determined that the nations and city-states at the top of the rankings had several things in
common. For one, they had well-established standards for education with clear goals for all students.
They also recruited teachers from the top 5 to 10 percent of university graduates each year, which is not
the case for most countries (National Public Radio 2010).
Finally, there is the issue of social factors. One analyst from the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development, the organization that created the test, attributed 20 percent of
performance differences and the United States’ low rankings to differences in social background.
Researchers noted that educational resources, including money and quality teachers, are not distributed
equitably in the United States. In the top-ranking countries, limited access to resources did not
necessarily predict low performance. Analysts also noted what they described as “resilient students,” or
those students who achieve at a higher level than one might expect given their social background. In
Shanghai and Singapore, the proportion of resilient students is about 70 percent. In the United States, it
is below 30 percent. These insights suggest that the United States’ educational system may be on a
descending path that could detrimentally affect the country’s economy and its social landscape
(National Public Radio 2010).

Making Connections:

the

Big Picture

Education in Afghanistan
Since the fall of the Taliban in Afghanistan, there has been a spike in demand for education. This
spike is so great, in fact, that it has exceeded the nation’s resources for meeting the demand. More
than 6.2 million students are enrolled in grades one through 12 in Afghanistan, and about 2.2
million of those students are female (World Bank 2011). Both of these figures are the largest in
Afghan history—far exceeding the time before the Taliban was in power. At the same time, there
is currently a severe shortage of teachers in Afghanistan, and the educators in the system are often
undertrained and frequently do not get paid on time. Currently, they are optimistic and enthusiastic
about educational opportunities and approach teaching with a positive attitude, but there is fear
that this optimism will not last.
With these challenges, there is a push to improve the quality of education in Afghanistan as
quickly as possible. Educational leaders are looking to other post-conflict countries for guidance,
hoping to learn from other nations that have faced similar circumstances. Their input suggests that
the keys to rebuilding education are an early focus on quality and a commitment to educational
access. Currently, educational quality in Afghanistan is generally considered poor, as is
educational access. Literacy and math skills are low, as are skills in critical thinking and problem
solving.
Education of females poses additional challenges since cultural norms decree that female
students should be taught by female teachers. Currently, there is a lack of female teachers to meet
that gender-based demand. In some provinces, the female student population falls below 15
percent of students (World Bank 2011). Female education is also important to Afghanistan’s future
because mothers are primary socialization agents: an educated mother is more likely to instill a
thirst for education in her children, setting up a positive cycle of education for generations to
come.
Improvements must be made to Afghanistan’s infrastructure in order to improve education,
which has historically been managed at the local level. The World Bank, which strives to help
developing countries break free of poverty and become self-sustaining has been hard at work to
assist the people of Afghanistan in improving educational quality and access. The Education
Quality Improvement Program provides training for teachers and grants to communities. The
program is active in all 34 provinces of Afghanistan, supporting grants for both quality
enhancement and development of infrastructure as well as providing a teacher education program.
Another program called Strengthening Higher Education focuses on six universities in
Afghanistan and four regional colleges. The emphasis of this program is on fostering relationships
with universities in other countries, including the United States and India, to focus on fields
including engineering, natural sciences, and English as a second language. The program also seeks
to improve libraries and laboratories through grants.
These efforts by the World Bank illustrate the ways global attention and support can benefit
an educational system. In developing countries like Afghanistan, partnerships with countries that
have established successful educational programs play a key role in efforts to rebuild their future.

Formal and Informal Education
As already mentioned, education is not solely concerned with the basic academic concepts that a
student learns in the classroom. Societies also educate their children, outside of the school system, in
matters of everyday practical living. These two types of learning are referred to as formal education and
informal education.
Formal education describes the learning of academic facts and concepts through a formal
curriculum. Arising from the tutelage of ancient Greek thinkers, centuries of scholars have examined
topics through formalized methods of learning. Education in earlier times was only available to the
higher classes; they had the means for access to scholarly materials, plus the luxury of leisure time that
could be used for learning. The Industrial Revolution and its accompanying social changes made
education more accessible to the general population. Many families in the emerging middle class found
new opportunities for schooling.
The modern U.S. educational system is the result of this progression. Today, basic education is
considered a right and responsibility for all citizens. Expectations of this system focus on formal
education, with curricula and testing designed to ensure that students learn the facts and concepts that
society believes are basic knowledge.
In contrast, informal education describes learning about cultural values, norms, and expected
behaviors by participating in a society. This type of learning occurs both through the formal education
system and at home. Our earliest learning experiences generally happen via parents, relatives, and
others in our community. Through informal education, we learn how to dress for different occasions,
how to perform regular life routines like shopping for and preparing food, and how to keep our bodies
clean.

CHAPTER 16 | EDUCATION

Cultural transmission refers to the way people come to learn the values, beliefs, and social norms
of their culture. Both informal and formal education include cultural transmission. For example, a
student will learn about cultural aspects of modern history in a U.S. History classroom. In that same
classroom, the student might learn the cultural norm for asking a classmate out on a date through
passing notes and whispered conversations.

Access to Education
Another global concern in education is universal access. This term refers to people’s equal ability to
participate in an education system. On a world level, access might be more difficult for certain groups
based on class or gender (as was the case in the United States earlier in our nation’s history, a dynamic
we still struggle to overcome). The modern idea of universal access arose in the United States as a
concern for people with disabilities. In the United States, one way in which universal education is
supported is through federal and state governments covering the cost of free public education. Of
course, the way this plays out in terms of school budgets and taxes makes this an often-contested topic
on the national, state, and community levels.

Figure 16.5 Per-student spending varies greatly by state, with the highest-ranking U.S. states spending up to three times
what the lowest-ranking states spend per student. How has your state’s per-student spending affected your educational
opportunities? (Graph courtesy of the New York Times Economix Blog and the U.S. Census Bureau 2007)

CHAPTER 16 | EDUCATION

A precedent for universal access to education in the United States was set with the 1972 U.S.
District Court for the District of Columbia’s decision in Mills v. Board of Education of the District of
Columbia. This case was brought on the behalf of seven school-age children with special needs who
argued that the school board was denying their access to free public education. The school board
maintained that the children’s “exceptional” needs, which included mental retardation and mental
illness, precluded their right to be educated for free in a public school setting. The board argued that the
cost of educating these children would be too expensive and that the children would therefore have to
remain at home without access to education.
This case was resolved in a hearing without any trial. The judge, Joseph Cornelius Waddy, upheld
the students’ right to education, finding that they were to be given either public education services or
private education paid for by the Washington, D.C., board of education. He noted that
Constitutional rights must be afforded citizens despite the greater expense involved
… the District of Columbia’s interest in educating the excluded children clearly must
outweigh its interest in preserving its financial resources. … The inadequacies of
the District of Columbia Public School System whether occasioned by insufficient
funding or administrative inefficiency, certainly cannot be permitted to bear more
heavily on the “exceptional” or handicapped child than on the normal child (Mills v.
Board of Education 1972).
Today, the optimal way to include differently able students in standard classrooms is still being
researched and debated. “Inclusion” is a method that involves complete immersion in a standard
classroom, whereas “mainstreaming” balances time in a special-needs classroom with standard
classroom participation. There continues to be social debate surrounding how to implement the ideal of
universal access to education.

16.2 Theoretical Perspectives on Education
While it is clear that education plays an integral role in individuals’ lives as well as society as a whole,
sociologists view that role from many diverse points of view. Functionalists believe that education
equips people to perform different functional roles in society. Conflict theorists view education as a
means of widening the gap in social inequality. Feminist theorists point to evidence that sexism in
education continues to prevent women from achieving a full measure of social equality. Symbolic
interactionists study the dynamics of the classroom, the interactions between students and teachers, and
how those affect everyday life. In this section, you will learn about each of these perspectives.

Functionalism
Functionalists view education as one of the more important social institutions in a society. They
contend that education contributes two kinds of functions: manifest (or primary) functions, which are
the intended and visible functions of education; and latent (or secondary) functions, which are the
hidden and unintended functions.
Manifest Functions
There are several major manifest functions associated with education. The first is socialization.
Beginning in preschool and kindergarten, students are taught to practice various societal roles. The
French sociologist Émile Durkheim (1858–1917), who established the academic discipline of sociology,
characterized schools as “socialization agencies that teach children how to get along with others and
prepare them for adult economic roles” (Durkheim 1898). Indeed, it seems that schools have taken on
this responsibility in full.
This socialization also involves learning the rules and norms of the society as a whole. In the early
days of compulsory education, students learned the dominant culture. Today, since the culture of the
United States is increasingly diverse, students may learn a variety of cultural norms, not only that of the
dominant culture.
School systems in the United States also transmit the core values of the nation through manifest
functions like social control. One of the roles of schools is to teach students conformity to law and
respect for authority. Obviously, such respect, given to teachers and administrators, will help a student
navigate the school environment. This function also prepares students to enter the workplace and the
world at large, where they will continue to be subject to people who have authority over them.
Fulfillment of this function rests primarily with classroom teachers and instructors who are with
students all day.

control. (Photo courtesy of Tulane Public Relations/flickr)

Education also provides one of the major methods used by people for upward social mobility. This
function is referred to as social placement. College and graduate schools are viewed as vehicles for
moving students closer to the careers that will give them the financial freedom and security they seek.
As a result, college students are often more motivated to study areas that they believe will be
advantageous on the social ladder. A student might value business courses over a class in Victorian
poetry because she sees business class as a stronger vehicle for financial success.
Latent Functions
Education also fulfills latent functions. As you well know, much goes on in a school that has little to do
with formal education. For example, you might notice an attractive fellow student when he gives a
particularly interesting answer in class—catching up with him and making a date speaks to the latent
function of courtship fulfilled by exposure to a peer group in the educational setting.
The educational setting introduces students to social networks that might last for years and can
help people find jobs after their schooling is complete. Of course, with social media such as Facebook
and LinkedIn, these networks are easier than ever to maintain. Another latent function is the ability to
work with others in small groups, a skill that is transferable to a workplace and that might not be
learned in a homeschool setting.
The educational system, especially as experienced on university campuses, has traditionally
provided a place for students to learn about various social issues. There is ample opportunity for social
and political advocacy, as well as the ability to develop tolerance to the many views represented on
campus. In 2011, the Occupy Wall Street movement swept across college campuses all over the United
States, leading to demonstrations in which diverse groups of students were unified with the purpose of
changing the political climate of the country.
Table 16.1 Manifest and Latent Functions of Education According to functionalist theory,
education contributes both manifest and latent functions.

goals

Latent Functions: Hidden, unstated functions

Functionalists recognize other ways that schools educate and enculturate students. One of the most
important American values students in the United States learn is that of individualism—the valuing of
the individual over the value of groups or society as a whole. In countries such as Japan and China,
where the good of the group is valued over the rights of the individual, students do not learn as they do
in the United States that the highest rewards go to the “best” individual in academics as well as
athletics. One of the roles of schools in the United States is fostering self-esteem; conversely, schools in
Japan focus on fostering social esteem—the honoring of the group over the individual.

CHAPTER 16 | EDUCATION

In the United States, schools also fill the role of preparing students for competition in life.
Obviously, athletics foster a competitive nature, but even in the classroom students compete against one
another academically. Schools also fill the role of teaching patriotism. Students recite the Pledge of
Allegiance each morning and take history classes where they learn about national heroes and the
nation’s past.

Figure 16.7 Starting each day with the Pledge of Allegiance is one way in which students are taught patriotism. (Photo

Another role of schools, according to functionalist theory, is that of sorting, or classifying students
based on academic merit or potential. The most capable students are identified early in schools through
testing and classroom achievements. Such students are placed in accelerated programs in anticipation of
successful college attendance.
Functionalists also contend that school, particularly in recent years, is taking over some of the
functions that were traditionally undertaken by family. Society relies on schools to teach about human
sexuality as well as basic skills such as budgeting and job applications—topics that at one time were
addressed by the family.

Conflict Theory
Conflict theorists do not believe that public schools reduce social inequality. Rather, they believe that
the educational system reinforces and perpetuates social inequalities arising from differences in class,
gender, race, and ethnicity. Where functionalists see education as serving a beneficial role, conflict
theorists view it more negatively. To them, educational systems preserve the status quo and push people
of lower status into obedience.

Figure 16.8 Conflict theorists see the education system as a means by which those in power stay in power. (Photo

The fulfillment of one’s education is closely linked to social class. Students of low socioeconomic
status are generally not afforded the same opportunities as students of higher status, no matter how
great their academic ability or desire to learn. Picture a student from a working-class home who wants
to do well in school. On a Monday, he’s assigned a paper that’s due Friday. Monday evening, he has to
babysit his younger sister while his divorced mother works. Tuesday and Wednesday, he works
stocking shelves after school until 10:00 p.m. By Thursday, the only day he might have available to
work on that assignment, he’s so exhausted he can’t bring himself to start the paper. His mother, though
she’d like to help him, is so tired herself that she isn’t able to give him the encouragement or support he
needs. And since English is her second language, she has difficulty with some of his educational
materials. They also lack a computer and printer at home, which most of his classmates have, so they

CHAPTER 16 | EDUCATION

have to rely on the public library or school system for access to technology. As this story shows, many
students from working class families have to contend with helping out at home, contributing financially
to the family, poor study environments and a lack of support from their families. This is a difficult
match with education systems that adhere to a traditional curriculum that is more easily understood and
completed by students of higher social classes.
Such a situation leads to social class reproduction, extensively studied by French sociologist Pierre
Bourdieu. He researched how cultural capital, or cultural knowledge that serves (metaphorically) as
currency that helps one navigate a culture, alters the experiences and opportunities available to French
students from different social classes. Members of the upper and middle classes have more cultural
capital than do families of lower class status. As a result, the educational system maintains a cycle in
which the dominant culture’s values are rewarded. Instruction and tests cater to the dominant culture
and leave others struggling to identify with values and competencies outside their social class. For
example, there has been a great deal of discussion over what standardized tests such as the SAT truly
measure. Many argue that the tests group students by cultural ability rather than by natural intelligence.
The cycle of rewarding those who possess cultural capital is found in formal educational curricula
as well as in the hidden curriculum, which refers to the type of nonacademic knowledge that one
learns through informal learning and cultural transmission. This hidden curriculum reinforces the
positions of those with higher cultural capital, and serves to bestow status unequally.
Conflict theorists point to tracking, a formalized sorting system that places students on “tracks”
(advanced versus low achievers) that perpetuate inequalities. While educators may believe that students
do better in tracked classes because they are with students of similar ability and may have access to
more individual attention from teachers, conflict theorists feel that tracking leads to self-fulfilling
prophecies in which students live up (or down) to teacher and societal expectations (Education Week
2004).
To conflict theorists, schools play the role of training working class students to accept and retain
their position as lower members of society. They argue that this role is fulfilled through the disparity of
resources available to students in richer and poorer neighborhoods as well as through testing (Lauen
and Tyson 2008).
IQ tests have been attacked for being biased—for testing cultural knowledge rather than actual
intelligence. For example, a test item may ask students what instruments belong in an orchestra. To
correctly answer this question requires certain cultural knowledge—knowledge most often held by
more affluent people who typically have more exposure to orchestral music. Though experts in testing
claim that bias has been eliminated from tests, conflict theorists maintain that this is impossible. These
tests, to conflict theorists, are another way in which education does not provide opportunities, but
instead maintains an established configuration of power.

Feminist Theory
Feminist theory aims to understand the mechanisms and roots of gender inequality in education, as well
as their societal repercussions. Like many other institutions of society, educational systems are
characterized by unequal treatment and opportunity for women. Almost two-thirds of the world’s 862
million illiterate people are women, and the illiteracy rate among women is expected to increase in
many regions, especially in several African and Asian countries (UNESCO 2005; World Bank 2007).
Women in American have been relatively late, historically speaking, to be granted entry to the
public university system. In fact, it wasn’t until the establishment of Title IX of the Education
Amendments in 1972 that discriminating on the basis of sex in U.S. education programs became illegal.
In the United States, there is also a post-education gender disparity between what male and female
college graduates earn. A study released in May 2011 showed that, among men and women who
graduated from college between 2006 and 2010, men out-earned women by an average of more than
$5,000 each year. First year job earnings for men averaged $33,150; for women the average was
$28,000 (Godofsky, Zukin, and van Horn 2011). Similar trends are seen among salaries of professionals
in virtually all industries.
When women face limited opportunities for education, their capacity to achieve equal rights,
including financial independence, are limited. Feminist theory seeks to promote women’s rights to
equal education (and its resultant benefits) across the world.

Grade Inflation: When Is an A Really a C?
Consider a large-city newspaper publisher. Ten years ago, when culling résumés for an entry-level
copywriter, they were well assured that if they selected a grad with a GPA of 3.7 or higher, they’d
have someone with the writing skills to contribute to the workplace on day one. But over the last
few years, they’ve noticed that A-level students don’t have the competency evident in the past.
More and more, they find themselves in the position of educating new hires in abilities that, in the
past, had been mastered during their education.
This story illustrates a growing concern referred to as grade inflation—a term used to
describe the observation that the correspondence between letter grades and the achievements they
reflect has been changing (in a downward direction) over time. Put simply, what used to be
considered C-level, or average, now often earns a student a B, or even an A.
Why is this happening? Research on this emerging issue is ongoing, so no one is quite sure
yet. Some cite the alleged shift toward a culture that rewards effort instead of product, i.e., the
amount of work a student puts in raises the grade, even if the resulting product is poor quality.
Another oft-cited contributor is the pressure many of today’s instructors feel to earn positive
course evaluations from their students—records that can tie into teacher compensation, award of
tenure, or the future career of a young grad teaching entry-level courses. The fact that these
reviews are commonly posted online exacerbates this pressure.
Other studies don’t agree that grade inflation exists at all. In any case, the issue is hotly
debated, with many being called upon to conduct research to help us better understand and respond
to this trend (National Public Radio 2004; Mansfield 2005).

Symbolic Interactionism
Symbolic interactionism sees education as one way labeling theory is seen in action. A symbolic
interactionist might say that this labeling has a direct correlation to those who are in power and those
who are being labeled. For example, low standardized test scores or poor performance in a particular
class often lead to a student being labeled as a low achiever. Such labels are difficult to “shake off,”
which can create a self-fulfilling prophecy (Merton 1968).
In his book High School Confidential, Jeremy Iverson details his experience as a Stanford graduate
posing as a student at a California high school. One of the problems he identifies in his research is that
of teachers applying labels that students are never able to lose. One teacher told him, without knowing
he was a bright graduate of a top university, that he would never amount to anything (Iverson 2006).
Iverson obviously didn’t take this teacher’s false assessment to heart. But when an actual 17-year-old
student hears this from a person with authority over her, it’s no wonder that the student might begin to
“live down to” that label.
The labeling with which symbolic interactionists concern themselves extends to the very degrees
that symbolize completion of education. Credentialism embodies the emphasis on certificates or
degrees to show that a person has a certain skill, has attained a certain level of education, or has met
certain job qualifications. These certificates or degrees serve as a symbol of what a person has
achieved, allowing the labeling of that individual.
Indeed, as these examples show, labeling theory can significantly impact a student’s schooling.
This is easily seen in the educational setting, as teachers and more powerful social groups within the
school dole out labels that are adopted by the entire school population.

16.3 Issues in Education
As schools strive to fill a variety of roles in their students’ lives, many issues and challenges arise.
Students walk a minefield of bullying, violence in schools, the results of declining funding, plus other
problems that affect their education. When Americans are asked about their opinion of public education
on the Gallup poll each year, reviews are mixed at best (Saad 2008). Schools are no longer merely a
place for learning and socializing. With the landmark Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka ruling in

CHAPTER 16 | EDUCATION

1954, schools became a repository of much political and legal action that is at the heart of several issues
in education.

Equal Education
Until the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education ruling, schools had operated under the precedent set by
Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896, which allowed racial segregation in schools and private businesses (the case
dealt specifically with railroads) and introduced the much maligned phrase “separate but equal” into the
United States lexicon. The 1954 Brown v. Board decision overruled this, declaring that state laws that
had established separate schools for black and white students were, in fact, unequal and
unconstitutional.
While the ruling paved the way toward civil rights, it was also met with contention in many
communities. In Arkansas in 1957, the governor mobilized the state National Guard to prevent black
students from entering Little Rock Central High School. President Eisenhower, in response, sent
members of the 101st Airborne Division from Kentucky to uphold the students’ right to enter the
school. In 1963, almost ten years after the ruling, Governor George Wallace of Alabama used his own
body to block two black students from entering the auditorium at the University of Alabama to enroll in
the school. Wallace’s desperate attempt to uphold his policy of “segregation now, segregation
tomorrow, segregation forever,” stated during his 1963 inauguration (PBS 2000) became known as the
“Stand in the Schoolhouse Door.” He refused to grant entry to the students until a general from the
Alabama National Guard arrived on President Kennedy’s order.

into Little Rock Central High School after the governor of Arkansas tried to deny them entry. (Photo courtesy of the U.S. Army)

Presently, students of all races and ethnicities are permitted into schools, but there remains a
troubling gap in the equality of education they receive. The long-term socially embedded effects of
racism—and other discrimination and disadvantage—have left a residual mark of inequality in the
nation’s education system. Students from wealthy families and those of lower socioeconomic status do
not receive the same opportunities.
Today’s public schools, at least in theory, are positioned to help remedy those gaps. Predicated on
the notion of universal access, this system is mandated to accept and retain all students regardless of
race, religion, social class, and the like. Moreover, public schools are held accountable to equitable perstudent spending (Resnick 2004). Private schools, usually only accessible to students from high-income
families, and schools in more affluent areas generally enjoy access to greater resources and better
opportunities. In fact, some of the key predictors for student performance include socioeconomic status
and family background. Children from families of lower socioeconomic status often enter school with
learning deficits they struggle to overcome throughout their educational tenure. These patterns,
uncovered in the landmark Coleman Report of 1966, are still highly relevant today, as sociologists still
generally agree that there is a great divide in the performance of white students from affluent
backgrounds and their non-white, less affluent, counterparts (Coleman 1966).

Head Start
The findings in the Coleman Report were so powerful that they brought about two major changes to
education in the United States. The federal Head Start program, which is still active and successful
today, was developed to give low-income students an opportunity to make up the pre-school deficit
discussed in Coleman’s findings. The program provides academic-centered preschool to students of low
socioeconomic status.

367

368

CHAPTER 16 | EDUCATION

Busing
The second major change brought about after the release of the Coleman Report was less successful
than the Head Start program and has been the subject of a great deal of controversy. With the goal of
further desegregating education, courts across the United States ordered some school districts to begin a
program that became known as “busing.” This program involved bringing students to schools outside
their neighborhoods (and therefore schools they would not normally have the opportunity to attend) to
bring racial diversity into balance. This practice was met with a great deal of public resistance from
people on both sides dissatisfied with white students traveling to inner city schools and minority
students bring transported to schools in the suburbs.

No Child Left Behind
In 2001, the Bush administration passed the No Child Left Behind Act, which requires states to test
students in designated grades. The results of those tests determine eligibility to receive federal funding.
Schools that do not meet the standards set by the Act run the risk of having their funding cut.
Sociologists and teachers alike have contended that the impact of the No Child Left Behind Act is far
more negative than positive, arguing that a “one size fits all” concept cannot apply to education.

Teaching to the Test
The funding tie-in of the No Child Left Behind Act has led to the social phenomenon commonly called
“teaching to the test,” which describes when a curriculum focuses on equipping students to succeed on
standardized tests, to the detriment of broader educational goals and concepts of learning. At issue are
two approaches to classroom education: the notion that teachers impart knowledge that students are
obligated to absorb, versus the concept of student-centered learning that seeks to teach children not
facts, but problem solving abilities and learning skills. Both types of learning have been valued in the
American school system. The former, to critics of “teaching to the test,” only equips students to
regurgitate facts, while the latter, to proponents of the other camp, fosters lifelong learning and
transferable work skills.

Bilingual Education
New issues of inequality have entered the national conversation in recent years with the issue of
bilingual education, which attempts to give equal opportunity to minority students through offering
instruction in languages other than English. Though it is actually an old issue (bilingual education was
federally mandated in 1968), it remains one of hot debate. Supporters of bilingual education argue that
all students deserve equal opportunities in education—opportunities some students cannot access
without instruction in their first language. On the other side, those who oppose bilingual education
often point to the need for English fluency in everyday life and in the professional world.

Charter Schools
Charter schools are self-governing public schools that have signed agreements with state governments
to improve students when poor performance is revealed on tests required by the No Child Left Behind
Act. While such schools receive public money, they are not subject to the same rules that apply to
regular public schools. In return, they make agreements to achieve specific results. Charter schools, as
part of the public education system, are free to attend, and are accessible via lottery when there are
more students seeking enrollment than there are spots available at the school. Some charter schools
specialize in certain fields, such as the arts or science, while others are more generalized.

Money as Motivation in Charter Schools
Public school teachers typically find stability, comprehensive benefits packages, and long-term job
security. In 2011, one charter school in New York City set out to learn if teachers would give up
those protections if it meant an opportunity to make much more money than the typical teacher’s
salary. The Equity Project is a privately run charter school that offered teachers positions paying
$125,000 per year (more than twice the average salary for teachers). The school’s founder and

CHAPTER 16 | EDUCATION

principal, Zeke Vanderhoek, explained that this allows him to attract the best and brightest teachers
to his school—to decide whom he hires and how much they are paid—and build a school where
“every teacher is a great teacher” (CBS News 2011). He sees attracting top teachers as a direct
road to student achievement. A nationwide talent search resulted in the submission of thousands of
applications. The final round of interviews consisted of a day-long trial run. The school looks for
teachers who can show evidence of student growth and achievement. They also must be highly
engaging.
The majority of students at the school are African American and Hispanic, from poor
families, and reading below grade level. The school faces the challenge faced by schools all over
the United States: getting poor, disadvantaged students to perform at the same level as their more
affluent counterparts. Vanderhoek believes his team of dream teachers can help students close their
learning gaps by several grade levels within one year.
This is not an affluent school. It is publicly funded and classes are held in trailers. Most of the
school’s budget goes into the teachers’ salaries. There are no reading or math aides; those roles are
filled by the regular classroom teachers.
The experiment may be working. Students who were asked how they feel about their
education at The Equity Project said that their teachers care if they succeed and give them the
attention they need to achieve at high levels. They cite the feeling that their teachers believe in
them as a major reason for liking school for the first time.
Of course, with the high salary comes high risk. Most public schools offer contracts to
teachers. Those contracts guarantee job security. But The Equity Project is an at-will employer.
Those who don’t meet the standards set by the school will lose their jobs. Vanderhoek does not
believe in teacher tenure, which he feels gives teachers “a job for life no matter how they perform”
(CBS News 2011). With a teaching staff of roughly 15, he terminated two teachers after the first
year. In comparison, in New York City as a whole, only seven teachers out of 55,000 with tenure
have been terminated for poor performance.
One of those two teachers who was let go said she was relieved, citing 80- to 90-hour work
weeks and a decline in the quality of her family life. Meanwhile, there is some question as to
whether the model is working. On one hand, there are individual success stories, such as a student
whose reading skills increased two grade levels in a single year. On the other, there is the fact that
on the state math and reading exams taken by all fifth graders, the Equity Project students
remained out-scored by other district schools (CBS News 2011).

Teacher Training
Schools face an issue of teacher effectiveness, in that most high school teachers perceive students as
being prepared for college, while most college professors do not see those same students as prepared for
the rigors of collegiate study. Some feel that this is due to teachers being unprepared to teach. Many
teachers in the United States teach subject matter that is outside their own field of study. This is not the
case in many European and Asian countries. Only eight percent of United States fourth-grade math
teachers majored or minored in math, compared with 48 percent in Singapore. Further, students in
disadvantaged American schools are 77 percent more likely to be educated by a teacher who didn’t
specialize in the subject matter than students who attend schools in affluent neighborhoods (Holt,
McGrath, and Seastrom 2006).

Social Promotion
Social promotion is another issue identified by sociologists. This is the concept of passing students to
the next grade regardless of their meeting standards for that grade. Critics of this practice argue that
students should never move to the next grade if they have not mastered the skills required to “graduate”
from the previous grade. Proponents of the practice question what a school is to do with a student who
is three to four years older than other students in his or her grade, saying this creates more issues than
the practice of social promotion.

Affirmative Action
Affirmative action has been a subject of debate, primarily as it relates to the admittance of college
students. Opponents suggest that, under affirmative action, minority students are given greater weighted
priorities for admittance. Supporters of affirmative action point to the way in which it grants
opportunities to students who are traditionally done a disservice in the college admission process.

369

370

CHAPTER 16 | EDUCATION

Rising Student Loan Debt
In a growing concern, the amount of college loan debt that students are taking on is creating a new
social challenge. As of 2010, the debts of students with student loans averaged $25,250 upon
graduation, leaving students hard-pressed to repay their education while earning entry-level wages,
even at the professional level (Lewin 2011). With the increase in unemployment since the 2008
recession, jobs are scarce, making this burden more pronounced. As recent grads find themselves
unable to meet their financial obligations, all of society is affected.

Home Schooling
Homeschooling refers to children being educated in their own homes, typically by a parent, instead of
in a traditional public or private school system. Proponents of this type of education argue that it
provides an outstanding opportunity for student-centered learning while circumventing problems that
plague today’s education system. Opponents counter that homeschooled children miss out on the
opportunity for social development that occurs in standard classroom environments and school settings.
Proponents say that parents know their own children better than anyone else and are thus best
equipped to teach them. Those on the other side of the debate assert that childhood education is a
complex task and requires the degree teachers spend four years earning. After all, they argue, a parent
may know her child’s body better than anyone, yet she seeks out a doctor for her child’s medical
treatment. Just as a doctor is a trained medical expert, teachers are trained education experts.
The National Center for Education Statistics shows that the quality of the national education
system isn’t the only major concern of homeschoolers. While nearly half cite their reason for
homeschooling as the belief that they can give their child a better education than the school system can,
just under 40 percent choose homeschooling for “religious reasons” (NCES 2008).
To date, researchers have not found consensus in studies evaluating the success, or lack thereof, of
homeschooling.

Section Summary
16.1 Education around the World
Educational systems around the world have many differences, though the same factors—including
resources and money—affect every educational system. Educational distribution is a major issue in
many nations, including in the United States, where the amount of money spent per student varies
greatly by state. Education happens through both formal and informal systems; both foster cultural
transmission. Universal access to education is a worldwide concern.

16.2 Theoretical Perspectives on Education
The major sociological theories offer insight into how we understand education. Functionalists view
education as an important social institution that contributes both manifest and latent functions.
Functionalists see education as serving the needs of society by preparing students for later roles, or
functions, in society. Conflict theorists see schools as a means for perpetuating class, racial-ethnic, and
gender inequalities. In the same vein, feminist theory focuses specifically on the mechanisms and roots
of gender inequality in education. The theory of symbolic interactionism focuses on education as a
means for labeling individuals.

16.3 Issues in Education
As schools continue to fill many roles in the lives of students, challenges arise. Historical issues include
the racial desegregation of schools, marked by the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka ruling.
In today’s diverse educational landscape, socioeconomic status and diversity remain at the heart of
issues in education, with programs such as the Head Start program attempting to give students equal
footing. Other educational issues that impact society include charter schools, teaching to the test,
student loan debt, and homeschooling.

Introduction to Government and Politics
Dubbed the “wedding of the century” by journalists, dignitaries, and commoners alike, the April 29,
2011, nuptials of Prince William and Catherine Middleton ignited a media frenzy months before the
ceremony even took place. Thousands of journalists reported on the ceremony, and the New York Times
estimated that 3 billion viewers watched the bride and groom exchange vows (Lyall 2011). In the weeks

377

378

CHAPTER 17 | GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS

leading up to the event, speculation about the wedding was a frequent topic of conversation on televised
news shows as well as in everyday conversation. When the morning of the wedding finally arrived,
nearly a million British citizens lined its procession route to catch a glimpse of the royals making their
way to the palace.
The popularity of Will and Kate, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, did not diminish when the
ceremony concluded. Competing tabloids began to feature headlines that proclaimed divorce,
pregnancy, and other sensational events in the couple’s life, while others focused on the particulars of
Kate’s hairstyles, dresses, and hats. Still other media focused their attention on the philanthropic
endeavors of the duke and duchess, who frequently use their influence to promote charitable endeavors.
Despite their appeal and link to a long-standing monarchy, William and Kate, along with the other
British royals, do not enjoy the same power their predecessors commanded in history. Instead, their role
is largely symbolic. While Henry VIII, for instance, had the authority to order executions and make
important state decisions based on what some might consider personal whims, today’s monarchs are
more akin to celebrities who possess the wealth and fame to support their favorite causes.

17.1 Power and Authority

From the time of King Henry VIII to the time of Will and Kate, the role of the royal family in the
British government has shifted dramatically. Between those two eras—and across the Atlantic—former
British subjects in what is now the United States fought for an alternative system of government . . . one
that left no room for royalty. Despite these differences, governments play the same fundamental role: in
some fashion, they exert control over the people they govern. The nature of that control—what we will
define as power and authority—is an important part of society.
Sociologists have a distinctive approach to studying governmental power and authority that differs
from the perspective of political scientists. For the most part, political scientists focus on studying how
power is distributed in different types of political systems. They would observe, for example, that the
United States’ political system is divided into three distinct branches (legislative, executive, and
judicial), and they would explore how public opinion affects political parties, elections, and the political
process in general. Sociologists, however, tend to be more interested in the influences of governmental
power on society and in how social conflicts arise from the distribution of power. Sociologists also
examine how the use of power affects local, state, national, and global agendas, which in turn affect
people differently based on status, class, and socioeconomic standing.

CHAPTER 17 | GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS

What Is Power?

Figure 17.3 Nazi leader Adolf Hitler was one of the most powerful and destructive dictators in modern history, pictured
here with fascist Benito Mussolini of Italy. (Photo courtesy of U.S. National Archives and Records Administration)

For centuries, philosophers, politicians, and social scientists have explored and commented on the
nature of power. Pittacus (c. 640-568 B.C.E.) opined, “The measure of a man is what he does with
power,” and Lord Acton perhaps more famously asserted, “Power tends to corrupt; absolute power
corrupts absolutely” (1887). Indeed, the concept of power can have decidedly negative connotations,
and the term itself is difficult to define.
Many scholars adopt the definition developed by German sociologist Max Weber, who said that
power is the ability to exercise one’s will over others (Weber 1922). Power affects more than personal
relationships; it shapes larger dynamics like social groups, professional organizations, and governments.
Similarly, a government’s power is not necessarily limited to control of its own citizens. A dominant
nation, for instance, will often use its clout to influence or support other governments or to seize control
of other nation states. Efforts by the U.S. government to wield power in other countries have included
joining with other nations to form the Allied forces during World War II, entering Iraq in 2002 to topple
Saddam Hussein’s regime, and imposing sanctions on the government of North Korea in the hopes of
constraining its development of nuclear weapons.
Endeavors to gain power and influence do not necessarily lead to violence, exploitation, or abuse.
Leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr. and Mohandas Gandhi, for example, commanded powerful
movements that affected positive change without military force. Both men organized nonviolent
protests to combat corruption and injustice and succeeded in inspiring major reform. They relied on a
variety of nonviolent protest strategies such as rallies, sit-ins, marches, petitions, and boycotts.
Modern technology has made such forms of nonviolent reform easier to implement. Today,
protesters can use cell phones and the internet to disseminate information and plans to masses of
protesters in a rapid and efficient manner. In Tunisia in 2011, for example, a nonviolent popular
uprising led to the president’s resignation, ushered in the end of one-party rule, and paved the way for
efforts at reform. The success of the Tunisian uprising, broadcast worldwide via Twitter feeds and other
social media, was an inspiration to political activists in other countries as well (a spread of
demonstrations that the media called the “Arab Spring”). Notice that, in this example, the users of
power were the citizens rather than their governments. They found they had power because they were
able to exercise their will over their own leader. Thus, government power does not necessarily equate
with absolute power.

Making Connections:

the

Big Picture

Did Facebook and Twitter Cause the Arab
Spring?
Recent movements and protests that were organized to reform governments and install democratic
ideals in northern African and the Middle East have been collectively labeled “Arab Spring” by
journalists. In describing the dramatic reform and protests in these regions, journalists have noted
the use of internet vehicles like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, some even implying that this
technology has been instrumental in spurring these reforms. In a nation with a strong capacity for
media censorship, social sites provided an opportunity for citizens to circumvent authoritarian
restrictions (Zuckerman 2011).
As discontents in northern Africa used the Internet to communicate, it provided them with an
invaluable tool: anonymity. John Pollock (2011), in an authoritative analysis published in MIT’s
Technology Review, gave readers an intriguing introduction to two transformative revolutionaries
named “Foetus” and “Waterman,” who are leaders in the Tunisian rebel group Takriz. Both men
relied heavily on the internet to communicate and even went so far as to call it the “GPS” for the
revolution (Pollock 2011). Before the internet, meetings of protestors led by dissidents like Foetus
and Waterman often required participants to assemble in person, placing them at risk of being
raided by government officials. Thus, leaders would more likely have been jailed, tortured—and
perhaps even killed—before movements could gain momentum.
The Internet also enabled widespread publicity about the atrocities being committed in the
Arab region. The fatal beating of Khaled Said, a young Egyptian computer programmer, provides
a prime example. Said, who possessed videos highlighting acts of police corruption in Egypt, was
brutally killed by law enforcement officers in the streets of Alexandria. After Said’s beating, Said’s
brother used his cell phone to capture photos of his brother’s grisly corpse and uploaded them to
Facebook. The photos were then used to start a protest group called “We Are All Khaled Said,”
which now has more than a million members (Pollock 2011). Numerous other videos and images,
similarly appalling, were posted on social media sites to build awareness and incite activism
among local citizens and the larger global community.

Types of Authority
The protesters in Tunisia and the civil rights protesters of Martin Luther King’s day had influence apart
from their position in a government. Their influence came, in part, from their ability to advocate for
what many people held as important values. Government leaders might have this kind of influence as
well, but they also have the advantage of wielding power associated with their position in the
government. As this example indicates, there is more than one type of authority in a community.
Authority refers to accepted power—that is, power that people agree to follow. People listen to
authority figures because they feel that these individuals are worthy of respect. Generally speaking,
people perceive the objectives and demands of an authority figure as reasonable and beneficial, or true.
A citizen’s interaction with a police officer is a good example of how people react to authority in
everyday life. For instance, a person who sees the flashing red and blue lights of a police car in his
rearview mirror usually pulls to the side of the road without hesitation. Such a driver most likely
assumes that the police officer behind him serves as a legitimate source of authority and has the right to
pull him over. As part of her official duties, the police officer then has the power to issue a speeding
ticket if the driver was driving too fast. If the same officer, however, were to command the driver to
follow her home and mow her lawn, the driver would likely protest that the officer does not have the
authority to make such a request.
Not all authority figures are police officers or elected officials or government authorities. Besides
formal offices, authority can arise from tradition and personal qualities. Economist and sociologist Max
Weber realized this when he examined individual action as it relates to authority, as well as large-scale
structures of authority and how they relate to a society’s economy. Based on this work, Weber
developed a classification system for authority. His three types of authority are traditional authority,
charismatic authority and legal-rational authority (Weber 1922).

Historic personality

Dynamic personality

Bureaucratic officials

Teresa, Martin Luther King, Jr.

Congress

Traditional Authority
According to Weber, the power of traditional authority is accepted because that has traditionally been
the case; its legitimacy exists because it has been accepted for a long time. Britain’s Queen Elizabeth,
for instance, occupies a position that she inherited based on the traditional rules of succession for the
monarchy. People adhere to traditional authority because they are invested in the past and feel obligated
to perpetuate it. In this type of authority, a ruler typically has no real force to carry out his will or
maintain his position but depends primarily on a group’s respect.
A more modern form of traditional authority is patrimonialism, which is traditional domination
that is facilitated by an administration and military that are purely personal instruments of the master
(Eisenberg 1998). In this form of authority, all officials are personal favorites appointed by the ruler.
These officials have no rights, and their privileges can be withdrawn or augmented based on the
caprices of the leader. The political organization of ancient Egypt typified such a system: when the
royal household decreed that a pyramid be built, every Egyptian was forced to work toward its
construction.
Traditional authority can be intertwined with race, class, and gender. In most societies, for
instance, men are more likely to be privileged than women and thus are more likely to hold roles of
authority. Similarly, members of dominant racial groups or upper-class families also win respect more
readily. In the United States, the Kennedy family, which has spawned many prominent politicians,
exemplifies this model.
Charismatic Authority
The power of charismatic authority is accepted because followers are drawn to the leader’s personal
qualities. The appeal of a charismatic leader can be extraordinary, inspiring followers to make unusual
sacrifices or to persevere in the midst of great hardship and persecution. Charismatic leaders usually
emerge in times of crisis and offer innovative or radical solutions. They may even offer a vision of a
new world order. Hitler’s rise to power in the postwar economic depression of Germany is an example.
Charismatic leaders tend to hold power for short durations, and according to Weber, they are just
as likely to be tyrannical as they are heroic. Diverse male leaders such as Hitler, Napoleon, Jesus Christ,
César Chávez, Malcolm X, and Winston Churchill are all considered charismatic leaders. Because so
few women have held dynamic positions of leadership throughout history, the list of charismatic female
leaders is comparatively short. Many historians consider figures such as Joan of Arc, Margaret
Thatcher, and Mother Teresa to be charismatic leaders.
Rational-Legal Authority
According to Weber, power made legitimate by laws, written rules, and regulations is termed rationallegal authority. In this type of authority, power is vested in a particular rationale, system, or ideology
and not necessarily in the person implementing the specifics of that doctrine. A nation that follows a
constitution is applying this type of authority. On a smaller scale, you might encounter rational-legal
authority in the workplace via the standards set forth in the employee handbook, which provides a
different type of authority than that of your boss.
Of course, ideals are seldom replicated in the real world. Few governments or leaders can be
neatly categorized. Some leaders, like Mohandas K. Gandhi for instance, can be considered charismatic
and legal-rational authority figures. Similarly, a leader or government can start out exemplifying one
type of authority and gradually evolve or change into another type.

17.2 Forms of Government

Brian Hillegas/flickr)

Most people generally agree that anarchy, or the absence of organized government, does not facilitate a
desirable living environment for society, but it is much harder for individuals to agree upon the
particulars of how a population should be governed. Throughout history, various forms of government
have evolved to suit the needs of changing populations and mindsets, each with pros and cons. Today,
members of Western society hold that democracy is the most just and stable form of government,
although former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once declared to the House of Commons,
“Indeed it has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except for all those other
forms that have been tried from time to time” (Shapiro 2006).

Monarchy
Even though people in the United States tend to be most aware of Great Britain’s royals, many other
nations also recognize kings, queens, princes, princesses, and other figures with official royal titles.
From one country to another, the power held by these positions varies. Strictly speaking, a monarchy is
a government in which a single person (a monarch) rules until that individual dies or abdicates the
throne. Usually, a monarch claims the rights to title by way of hereditary succession or as a result of
some sort of divine appointment or calling. As mentioned previously, the monarchies of most modern
nations are ceremonial remnants of tradition, and individuals who hold titles in such sovereignties are
often aristocratic figureheads.
A few nations today, however, are run by governments wherein a monarch has absolute or
unmitigated power. Such nations are called absolute monarchies. Although governments and regimes
are constantly changing across the global landscape, it is generally safe to say that most modern
absolute monarchies are concentrated in the Middle East and Africa. The small, oil-rich nation of
Oman, for instance, is an example of an absolute monarchy. In this nation, Sultan Qaboos bin Said Al
Said has ruled since the 1970s. Recently, living conditions and opportunities for Oman’s citizens have
improved, but many citizens who live under the reign of an absolute ruler must contend with oppressive
or unfair policies that are installed based on the unchecked whims or political agendas of that leader.
In today’s global political climate, monarchies far more often take the form of constitutional
monarchies, governments of nations that recognize monarchs but require these figures to abide by the
laws of a greater constitution. Many countries that are now constitutional monarchies evolved from
governments that were once considered absolute monarchies. In most cases, constitutional monarchies,
such as Great Britain and Canada, feature elected prime ministers whose leadership role is far more
involved and significant than that of its titled monarchs. In spite of their limited authority, monarchs
endure in such governments because people enjoy their ceremonial significance and the pageantry of
their rites.

Oligarchy
The power in an oligarchy is held by a small, elite group. Unlike in a monarchy, members of an
oligarchy do not necessarily achieve their status based on ties to noble ancestry. Rather, they may
ascend to positions of power because of military might, economic power, or similar circumstances.
The concept of oligarchy is somewhat elusive; rarely does a society openly define itself as an
oligarchy. Generally, the word carries negative connotations and conjures notions of a corrupt group
whose members make unfair policy decisions in order to maintain their privileged positions. Many
modern nations that claim to be democracies are really oligarchies. In fact, some prominent journalists
have labeled the United States an oligarchy, pointing to the influence of large corporations and Wall
Street executives on American policy (Krugman 2011). Other political analysts assert that all
democracies are really just “elected oligarchies,” or systems in which citizens must vote for an
individual who is part of a pool of candidates who come from the society’s elite ruling class (Winters
2011).
Oligarchies have existed throughout history, and today many consider Russia an example of
oligarchic political structure. After the fall of communism, groups of business owners captured control
of this nation’s natural resources and have used the opportunity to expand their wealth and political
influence. Once an oligarchic power structure is established, it can be very difficult for middle- and
lower-class citizens to advance their socioeconomic status.

Is the United States an Oligarchy?
During the famed Gilded Age of American history, prominent socialite Mrs. Stuyvesant Fish
organized and hosted a lavish dinner party in honor of her pampered dog, who arrived at the
function sporting a $15,000 diamond collar (PBS Online 1999). Such absurd luxuries were fairly
commonplace among the ultra-rich during this era of American history, which saw the rise and
dominance of such families as the Vanderbilts, Rockefellers, and Carnegies. As the super-rich
reveled in their wealth, however, most Americans scraped by, living below what was considered
the poverty level.

extravagant wealth that characterized the Gilded Age. (Photo courtesy of ckramer/flickr)

Interestingly, some scholars now believe that the United States has embarked on a second
Gilded Age and have offered hard data to back up their assertions. Such camps point to the fact
that the “400 wealthiest American families now own more than the ‘lower’ 150 million Americans
put together” (Schulz 2011). Much of this current generation’s wealth is concentrated among
corporate executives and Wall Street tycoons.
Many of the super-rich use their economic clout to purchase more than luxury items.
Specifically, wealthy individuals and corporations are major political donors. Because their
campaign contributions have the potential to influence policy decisions and the election of
candidates, the economic power of this segment of society is used for acquiring political power. As
this dynamic continues, it supports the view that the concentration of wealth in the United States
has contributed to making it like an oligarchy (Krugman 2011).
These patterns of wealth distribution and political contributions have spurred lively debate in
recent years. Some see great wealth as a fair reward for hard work and talent, believing that
political contributions are part of free expression in a democratic society. Others maintain that the
concentration of wealth is a signal that too many people’s economic opportunities are limited.
Another concern is that lack of equal power in making monetary donations will translate into an
uneven distribution of political power—a situation that raises questions of the fairness of a
“representational” system. These viewpoints underlay many of the recent political debates about
tax policy, campaign finance reform, and government budgets in the United States.

Dictatorship
Power in a dictatorship is held by a single person (or a very small group) that wields complete and
absolute authority over a government or populace after the dictator rises to power, usually through
economic or military might. Similar to many absolute monarchies, dictatorships may often be corrupt
and seek to limit and even eradicate the liberties of the general population. Many dictators start out as
military leaders and are more conditioned to violence if they face opposition than non-military
figureheads.
Dictators use a variety of means to perpetuate their authority. Intimidation and brutality are often
foremost among their tactics; individuals are not likely to rebel against a regime if they know they will
be hurt. Some dictators also possess the personal appeal that Max Weber identified with a charismatic

CHAPTER 17 | GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS

leader. Subjects of such a dictator may believe that the leader has special ability or authority and may be
willing to submit to his or her authority. Popular images of the late Kim Jong-Il, as well as his
successor, Kim Jong-Un, exemplify this type of charismatic dictatorship.
Many dictatorships do not align themselves strictly with any particular belief system or ideology;
the goal of this type of regime is usually limited to preserving the authority of the dictator at its helm.
The totalitarian dictatorship describes a more ambitious and oppressive style of dictatorship that
attempts to control all aspects of its subjects’ lives. Communist regimes, for instance, are often
totalitarian in nature. They may attempt to regulate how many children citizens bear, what religious
beliefs they hold, and so forth. They may also demand that citizens publicly demonstrate their faith in
the regime by participating in public marches and demonstrations.
Some “benevolent” dictators, such as Napoleon and Anwar Sadat, are credited with advancing
their people or exercising a modest level of evenhandedness, but many end up grossly abusing their
power. Joseph Stalin, Adolf Hitler, Kim Jong-Il, Saddam Hussein, and Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe, for
instance, are heads of state who earned a reputation for leading through fear and intimidation. Hitler, for
example, is responsible for the genocide of millions of Jews and other groups, while Mugabe has been
accused of ruthless land acquisition.

Democracy
A democracy is a form of government that strives to provide all citizens with an equal voice, or vote, in
determining state policy, regardless of their level of socioeconomic status. Another important
fundamental of the democratic state is the establishment and governance of a just and comprehensive
constitution that delineates the roles and responsibilities of leaders and citizens alike.
Democracies, in general, assure certain basic rights to their citizens. First and foremost, citizens
are free to organize political parties and hold elections. Leaders, once elected, must abide by the terms
of the given nation’s constitution and are limited in the powers they can exercise, as well as in the
length of the duration of their terms. Most democratic societies also champion freedom of individual
speech, the press, and assembly, and they prohibit unlawful imprisonment. Of course, even in a
democratic society, the government constrains citizens from total freedom to act however they wish. A
democratically elected government does this by passing laws and writing regulations that, at least
ideally, reflect the will of the majority of its people.
Although the United States champions the democratic ideology, it is not a “pure” democracy. In a
purely democratic society, all citizens would vote on all proposed legislation, and this is not how laws
are passed in the United States. There is a practical reason for this: a pure democracy would be hard to
implement. Thus, the United States is a constitution-based federal republic in which citizens elect
representatives to make policy decisions on their behalf. The term representative democracy, which is
virtually synonymous with republic, can also be used to describe a government in which citizens elect
representatives to promote policies that favor their interests. In the United States, representatives are
elected at local and state levels, and the votes of the Electoral College determine who will hold the

385

386

CHAPTER 17 | GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS

office of president. Each of the three branches of the United States government—the executive, judicial,
and legislative—is held in check by the other branches.

17.3 Politics in the United States

Figure 17.10 Americans’ right to vote in free elections is a fundamental element of the nation’s democratic structure and a
privilege envied by citizens of more oppressive societies. (Photo courtesy of David Goehring/flickr)

In describing a nation’s politics, it’s important to define the term. Some associate “politics” with power,
others with freedom. Some with corruption, others with rhetoric. How do sociologists understand
politics? To sociologists, politics is a means of studying a nation or group’s underlying social norms
and values. A group’s political structure and practices provide insight into its distribution of power and
wealth, as well as its larger philosophical and cultural beliefs. A cursory sociological analysis of U.S.
politics might, for instance, suggest that Americans’ desire to promote equality and democracy on a
theoretical level is at odds with the nation’s real-life capitalist orientation.
The famous phrase “by the people, for the people” is at the heart of American politics and sums up
the most essential part of this nation’s political system: the notion that citizens willingly and freely elect
representatives they believe will look out for their interests. Although many Americans take for granted
the right of citizens to hold free elections, it is a vital foundation of any democracy. However, at the
time the U.S. government was formed, African Americans and women were denied voting privileges.
History details the struggles that each of these minority groups undertook to secure rights that had been
granted to their white male counterparts. Nevertheless, their history (and the earlier history of the
struggle for American independence from British rule) has failed to inspire some Americans to show up
at the polls or even to register to vote.
Naturally, citizens must participate in the democratic process in order for their voices to be heard.
Sociologists understand voting to be at the heart of the U.S. political process because it is a
fundamental political behavior in a democracy. Problems with the democratic process, which include
more than limited voter turnout, require us to more closely examine complex social issues.

Voter Participation
Voter participation is essential to the success of the American political system. Although many
Americans are quick to complain about laws and political leadership, roughly half of the population
does not vote in any given election year (United States Elections Project 2010). Some years have seen
even lower turnouts; in 2010, for instance, only 37.8 percent of the population participated in the
electoral process (United States Elections Project 2011). Poor turnout can skew election results,
particularly if one age or socioeconomic group is more diligent in its efforts to make it to the polls.
Certain voting advocacy groups work to improve turnout. Rock the Vote, for example, targets and
reaches out to America’s youngest potential voters to educate and equip them to share their voice at the
polls. Public service promos from celebrity musicians support their cause. Native Vote is an
organization that strives to inform American Indians about upcoming elections and encourages their
participation. America’s Hispanic population is reached out to by the National Council of La Raza,
which strives to improve voter turnout among the Latino population. According to the Pew Research
Center, the portion of minority race voters has been increasing steadily over the past few decades
(Lopez and Taylor 2009).
Race, Gender, and Class Issues
Although recent records have shown more minorities voting now than ever before, this trend is still
fairly new. Historically, African Americans and other minorities have been underrepresented at the
polls. Black men were not allowed to vote at all until after the Civil War, and black women gained the

CHAPTER 17 | GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS

right to vote along with other women only with the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920.
For years, African Americans who were brave enough to vote were discouraged by discriminatory
legislation, passed in many southern states, which required poll taxes and literacy tests of prospective
voters. Literacy tests were not outlawed until 1965, when President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting
Rights Act.
The 1960s saw other important reforms in U.S. voting. Shortly before the Voting Rights Act was
passed, the 1964 U.S. Supreme Court case Reynolds v. Sims changed the nature of elections. This
landmark decision reaffirmed the notion of “ one person, one vote,” a concept holding that each
person’s vote should be counted equally. Before this decision, unequal distributions of population
enabled small groups of people in sparsely populated rural areas to have as much voting power as
densely populated urban areas. After Reynolds v. Sims, districts were redrawn so that they would
include equal numbers of voters.
Evidence suggests that legal protection of voting rights does not directly translate into equal voting
power. Relative to their presence in the U.S. population, women and racial/ethnic minorities are
underrepresented in the U.S. Congress. White males still dominate both houses. For example, there is
only a single Native American legislator currently in Congress. And until the inauguration of Barack
Obama in 2009, all U.S. presidents were white men.
Like race and ethnicity, social class also has impacted voting practices. Voting rates among lowereducated, lower-paid workers are less than for people with higher socioeconomic status, fostering a
system in which people with more power and access to resources have the means to perpetuate their
power. Several explanations have been offered to account for this difference (Raymond 2010). Workers
in low-paying service jobs might find it harder to get to the polls because they lack flexibility in their
work hours and quality daycare to look after children while they vote. Because a larger share of racial
and ethnic minorities is employed in such positions, social class may be linked to race and ethnicity in
influencing voting rates. Attitudes play a role as well. Some people of low socioeconomic status or
minority race/ethnicity doubt their vote will count or voice will be heard because they have seen no
evidence of their political power in their communities. Many believe that what they already have is all
they can achieve.
In the American democracy, there are means to power and voice aside from holding political
office. As suggested earlier in the discussion on oligarchy, money can carry a lot of influence. Free
speech, a right available to all, can also be an influence. People can participate in a democracy through
volunteering time toward political advocacy, writing to their elected officials, or sharing views in public
forums like blogs or letters to the editor, forming or joining cause-related political organizations like
PACs (political action committees) and interest groups, participating in public demonstrations, and even
running for local office.

and Power

CHAPTER 17 | GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS

Sociologists rely on organizational frameworks or paradigms to make sense of their study of sociology;
already there are many widely recognized schemas for evaluating sociological data and observations.
Each paradigm looks at the study of sociology through a unique lens. The sociological examination of
government and power can thus be evaluated using a variety of perspectives that help the evaluator gain
a broader perspective. Functionalism, conflict theory, and symbolic interactionism are a few of the more
widely recognized philosophical stances in practice today.

Functionalism
According to functionalism, the government has four main purposes: planning and directing society,
meeting social needs, maintaining law and order, and managing international relations. According to
functionalism, all aspects of society serve a purpose.
Functionalists view government and politics as a way to enforce norms and regulate conflict.
Functionalists see active social change, such as the sit-in on Wall Street, as undesirable because it forces
change and, as a result, undesirable things that might have to be compensated for. Functionalists seek
consensus and order in society. Dysfunction creates social problems that lead to social change. For
instance, functionalists would see monetary political contributions as a way of keeping people
connected to the democratic process. This would be in opposition to a conflict theorist who would see
this financial contribution as a way for the rich to perpetuate their own wealth.

Conflict Theory
Philosopher and social scientist Karl Marx was a seminal force in developing the conflict theory
perspective. He was a proponent of conflict, in general, because he felt that it was the only means of
promoting positive change for the underprivileged. Marx did not agree with Durkheim’s notions of
cooperation and interdependence; he instead saw society as a stage for exploitation and strife.
G. William Domhoff, a contemporary sociologist, is a modern-day proponent of Marx’s theories
and has written numerous commentaries on the existence of a modern-day power elite in American
society. Domhoff (2011) has devoted a considerable amount of energy to his effort of pointing out the
power elite’s influence on policy and society in general.
Domhoff’s 1967 publication Who Rules America? established his reputation as controversial and
bold social scientist. Drawing on powerful ideas already explored by Mills and Marx, Domhoff pointed
out uncomfortable realities about the American political and social systems. Today Domhoff is still a
vocal participant in the field of sociology, publishing current books, teaching in the University of
California system, and maintaining a website that offers a sampling of his professional work and studies
on topics related to sociology.
Domhoff’s research helped to popularize the concept of the power elite. His theories describe the
members of the power elite maintaining their position by collectively following the same social
patterns, such as vacationing at a handful of destinations, joining elite clubs, and attending select
schools. He also pointed out that the existence of a power elite stands in contrast to an important
American ideal: that all Americans have a voice in their government. Domhoff acknowledges that all
Americans can potentially exert political influence, but he asserts that our current social and political
systems make it easier for the wealthiest citizens to shape policy.
Conflict Theory in Action

Figure 17.12 Although military technology has evolved considerably over the course of history, the fundamental causes of
conflict among nations remain essentially the same. (Photo courtesy of Wikimedia Commons)

Even before there were modern nation-states, political conflicts arose among competing societies or
factions of people. Vikings attacked continental European tribes in search of loot, and, later, European

CHAPTER 17 | GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS

explorers landed on foreign shores to claim the resources of indigenous groups. Conflicts also arose
among competing groups within individual sovereignties, as evidenced by the bloody French
Revolution. Nearly all conflicts in the past and present, however, are spurred by basic desires: the drive
to protect or gain territory and wealth, and the need to preserve liberty and autonomy.
According to sociologist and philosopher Karl Marx, such conflicts are necessary, albeit ugly,
steps toward a more egalitarian society. Marx saw a historical pattern in which revolutionaries toppled
elite power structures, after which wealth and authority were more evenly dispersed among the
population, and the overall social order advances. In this pattern of change through conflict, people tend
to gain greater personal freedom and economic stability (1848).
Modern-day life is not without a multitude of political conflicts: discontents in Egypt overthrow
dictator Hosni Mubarak, disenchanted American Tea Partiers call for government realignment, and
Occupy Wall Street protesters decry corporate greed. Indeed, the study of any given conflict offers a
window of insight into the social structure of its surrounding culture, as well as insight into the larger
human condition
Many current American conflicts are concentrated internally. The United States the government,
for instance, has almost shut down because Republicans and Democrats could not agree on budget
issues. This conflict continues to be at the center of American politics. Similarly, over the last few years
the philosophical differences between the Democratic and Republican parties have remained on the
forefront. Frustration with the traditional two-party system helped to spawn the formation of the Tea
Party, a grassroots movement with a strong conservative and libertarian bent.

Figure 17.13 What symbols of the Boston Tea Party are represented in this painting? How might a symbolic interactionist
explain the way the modern-day Tea Party has reclaimed and repurposed these symbolic meanings? (Photo courtesy of
Wikimedia Commons)

Symbolic Interactionism
Other sociologists study government and power by relying on the framework of symbolic
interactionism, which is grounded in the works of Max Weber and George H. Mead.
Symbolic interactionism, as it pertains to government, focuses its attention on figures, emblems, or
individuals that represent power and authority. Many diverse entities in larger society can be considered
symbolic: trees, doves, wedding rings. Images that represent the power and authority of the United
States include the White House, the eagle, and the American flag. The Seal of the President of the
United States, along with the office in general incites respect and reverence in many Americans.
Symbolic interactionists are not interested in large structures such as the government. As microsociologists, they are more interested in the face-to-face aspects of politics. In reality, much of politics
consists of face-to-face backroom meetings and lobbyist efforts. What the public often sees is the front
porch of politics that is sanitized by the media through gatekeeping.
Symbolic interactionists are most interested in the interaction between these small groups who
make decisions, or in the case of some recent congressional committees, demonstrate the inability to
make any decisions at all. The heart of politics is the result of interaction between individuals and small
groups over periods of time. These meetings produce new meanings and perspectives that individuals
use to make sure there are future interactions.

Section Summary
17.1 Power and Authority
Sociologists examine government and politics in terms of their impact on individuals and larger social
systems. Power is an entity or individual’s ability to control or direct others, while authority is influence
that is predicated on perceived legitimacy. Max Weber studied power and authority, differentiating
between the two concepts and formulating a system for classifying types of authority.

17.2 Forms of Government
Nations are governed by different political systems, including monarchies, oligarchies, dictatorships,
and democracies. Generally speaking, citizens of nations wherein power is concentrated in one leader
or a small group are more likely to suffer violations of civil liberties and experience economic
inequality. Many nations that are today organized around democratic ideals started out as monarchies or
dictatorships but have evolved into more egalitarian systems. Democratic ideals, although hard to
implement and achieve, promote basic human rights and justice for all citizens.

17.3 Politics in the United States
The success and validity of American democracy hinges on free, fair elections that are characterized by
the support and participation of diverse citizens. In spite of their importance, elections have low
participation. In the past, the voice of minority groups was nearly imperceptible in elections, but recent

CHAPTER 17 | GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS

trends have shown increased voter turnout across many minority races and ethnicities. In the past, the
creation and sustenance of a fair voting process has necessitated government intervention, particularly
on the legislative level. The Reynolds v. Sims case, with its landmark “one person, one vote” ruling is an
excellent example of such action.

17.4 Theoretical Perspectives on Government and Power
Sociologists use frameworks to gain perspective on data and observations related to the study of power
and government. Durkheim’s functionalism suggests that societal power and structure is predicated on
cooperation, interdependence, and shared goals or values. Conflict theory, rooted in Marxism, asserts
that societal structures are the result of social groups competing for wealth and influence. Symbolic
interactionism examines a smaller realm of sociological interest: the individual’s perception of symbols
of power and their subsequent reaction to the face-to-face interactions of the political realm.

Introduction to Work and the Economy
Ever since the first people traded one item for another, there has been some form of economy in the
world. It is how people optimize what they have to meet their wants and needs. Economy refers to the
social institution through which a society’s resources (goods and services) are managed. Goods, or
commodities, are the physical objects we find, grow, or make in order to meet our needs and the needs

397

398

CHAPTER 18 | WORK AND THE ECONOMY

of others. Goods can meet essential needs, such as a place to live, clothing, and food, or they can be
luxuries—those things we do not need to live but want anyway. In contrast to these objects, services are
activities that benefit people. Examples of services include food preparation and delivery, health care,
education, and entertainment. These services provide some of the resources that help to maintain and
improve a society. The food industry helps ensure that all of a society’s members have access to
sustenance. Health care and education systems care for those in need, help foster longevity, and equip
people to become productive members of society.
Economy is one of human society’s earliest social structures. Our earliest forms of writing (such as
Sumerian clay tablets) were developed to record transactions, payments, and debts between merchants.
As societies grow and change, so do their economies. The economy of a small farming community is
very different from the economy of a large nation with advanced technology. In this chapter, we will
examine different types of economic systems and how they have functioned in various societies.

influential capitalists in history. They have very different views on how economies should be run. (Photos (a) and (b) courtesy of

The dominant economic systems of the modern era have been capitalism and socialism, and there have
been many variations of each system across the globe. Countries have switched systems as their rulers
and economic fortunes have changed. For example, Russia has been transitioning to a market-based
economy since the fall of communism in that region of the world. Vietnam, where the economy was
devastated by the Vietnam War, restructured to a state-run economy in response, and more recently has
been moving toward a socialist-style market economy. In the past, other economic systems reflected the
societies that formed them. Many of these earlier systems lasted centuries. These changes in economies
raise many questions for sociologists. What are these older economic systems? How did they develop?
Why did they fade away? What are the similarities and differences between older economic systems
and modern ones?

Economics of Agricultural, Industrial, and Postindustrial
Societies

Our earliest ancestors lived as hunter-gatherers. Small groups of extended families roamed from place
to place looking for means to subsist. They would settle in an area for a brief time when there were

CHAPTER 18 | WORK AND THE ECONOMY

abundant resources. They hunted animals for their meat and gathered wild fruits, vegetables, and
cereals. They ate what they caught or gathered as soon as possible because they had no way of
preserving or transporting it. Once the resources of an area ran low, the group had to move on, and
everything they owned had to travel with them. Food reserves only consisted of what they could carry.
Many sociologists contend that hunter-gatherers did not have a true economy because groups did not
typically trade with other groups due to the scarcity of goods.
The Agricultural Revolution
The first true economies arrived when people started raising crops and domesticating animals. Although
there is still a great deal of disagreement among archeologists as to the exact timeline, research
indicates that agriculture began independently and at different times in several places around the world.
The earliest agriculture was in the Fertile Crescent in the Middle East around 11,000–10,000 years ago.
Next were the valleys of the Indus, Yangtze, and Yellow rivers in India and China, between 10,000 and
9,000 years ago. The people living in the highlands of New Guinea developed agriculture between
9,000 and 6,000 years ago, while people were farming in Sub-Saharan Africa between 5,000 and 4,000
years ago. Agriculture developed later in the western hemisphere, arising in what would become the
eastern United States, central Mexico, and northern South America between 5,000 and 3,000 years ago
(Diamond 2003).

Agriculture began with the simplest of technologies—for example, a pointed stick to break up the
soil—but really took off when people harnessed animals to pull an even more efficient tool for the same
task: a plow. With this new technology, one family could grow enough crops not only to feed
themselves but others as well. Knowing there would be abundant food each year as long as crops were
tended led people to abandon the nomadic life of hunter-gatherers and settle down to farm.
The improved efficiency in food production meant that not everyone had to toil all day in the
fields. As agriculture grew, new jobs emerged, along with new technologies. Excess crops needed to be
stored, processed, protected, and transported. Farming equipment and irrigation systems needed to be
built and maintained. Wild animals needed to be domesticated and herds shepherded. Economies begin
to develop because people now had goods and services to trade.
As more people specialized in nonfarming jobs, villages grew into towns and then into cities.
Urban areas created the need for administrators and public servants. Disputes over ownership,
payments, debts, compensation for damages, and the like led to the need for laws and courts—and the
judges, clerks, lawyers, and police who administered and enforced those laws.
At first, most goods and services were traded as gifts or through bartering between small social
groups (Mauss 1922). Exchanging one form of goods or services for another was known as bartering.
This system only works when one person happens to have something the other person needs at the same
time. To solve this problem, people developed the idea of a means of exchange that could be used at
any time: that is, money. Money refers to an object that a society agrees to assign a value to so it can be
exchanged for payment. In early economies, money was often objects like cowry shells, rice, barley, or
even rum. Precious metals quickly became the preferred means of exchange in many cultures because
of their durability and portability. The first coins were minted in Lydia in what is now Turkey around
650–600 B.C.E. (Goldsborough 2010). Early legal codes established the value of money and the rates
of exchange for various commodities. They also established the rules for inheritance, fines as penalties
for crimes, and how property was to be divided and taxed (Horne 1915). A symbolic interactionist
would note that bartering and money are systems of symbolic exchange. Monetary objects took on a
symbolic meaning, one that carries into our modern-day use of checks and debit cards.

Careers in Sociology

The Lady Who Lives without Money
Imagine having no money. If you wanted some french fries, needed a new pair of shoes, or were
due to get an oil change for your car, how would you get those goods and services?
This isn’t just a theoretical question. Think about it. What do those on the outskirts of society
do in these situations? Think of someone escaping domestic abuse who gave up everything and
has no resources. Or an immigrant who wants to build a new life but who had to leave another life
behind to find that opportunity. Or a homeless person who simply wants a meal to eat.
This last example, homelessness, is what caused Heidemarie Schwermer to give up money. A
divorced high school teacher in Germany, Schwermer’s life took a turn when she relocated her
children to a rural town with a significant homeless population. She began to question what serves
as currency in a society and decided to try something new.
Schwermer founded a business called Gib und Nimm—in English, “give and take.” It
operated on a moneyless basis and strived to facilitate people swapping goods and services for
other goods and services—no cash allowed (Schwermer 2007). What began as a short experiment
has become a new way of life. Schwermer says the change has helped her focus on people’s inner
value instead of their outward wealth. It has also led to two books telling her story (she’s donated
all proceeds to charity) and, most importantly, a richness in her life she was unable to attain with
money.
How might our three sociological perspectives view her actions? What would most interest
them about her nonconventional ways? Would a functionalist consider her aberration of norms a
social dysfunction that upsets the normal balance? How would a conflict theorist place her in the
social hierarchy? What might a symbolic interactionist make of her choice not to use
money—such an important symbol in the modern world?
What do you make of Gib und Nimm?
As city-states grew into countries and countries grew into empires, their economies grew as well.
When large empires broke up, their economies broke up too. The governments of newly formed nations
sought to protect and increase their markets. They financed voyages of discovery to find new markets
and resources all over the world, ushering in a rapid progression of economic development.
Colonies were established to secure these markets, and wars were financed to take over territory.
These ventures were funded in part by raising capital from investors who were paid back from the
goods obtained. Governments and private citizens also set up large trading companies that financed
their enterprises around the world by selling stocks and bonds.
Governments tried to protect their share of the markets by developing a system called
mercantilism. Mercantilism is an economic policy based on accumulating silver and gold by
controlling colonial and foreign markets through taxes and other charges. The resulting restrictive
practices and exacting demands included monopolies, bans on certain goods, high tariffs, and
exclusivity requirements. Mercantilistic governments also promoted manufacturing and, with the ability
to fund technological improvements, they helped create the equipment that led to the Industrial
Revolution.
The Industrial Revolution
Up until the end of the 18th century, most manufacturing was done using manual labor. This changed as
research led to machines that could be used to manufacture goods. A small number of innovations led
to a large number of changes in the British economy. In the textile industries, the spinning of cotton,
worsted yarn, and flax could be done more quickly and less expensively using new machines with
names like the Spinning Jenny and the Spinning Mule (Bond 2003). Another important innovation was
made in the production of iron: Coke from coal could now be used in all stages of smelting rather than
charcoal from wood, dramatically lowering the cost of iron production while increasing availability
(Bond 2003). James Watt ushered in what many scholars recognize as the greatest change,
revolutionizing transportation and, thereby, the entire production of goods with his improved steam
engine.

CHAPTER 18 | WORK AND THE ECONOMY

As people moved to cities to fill factory jobs, factory production also changed. Workers did their
jobs in assembly lines and were trained to complete only one or two steps in the manufacturing process.
These advances meant that more finished goods could be manufactured with more efficiency and speed
than ever before.
The Industrial Revolution also changed agricultural practices. Until that time, many people
practiced subsistence farming in which they produced only enough to feed themselves and pay their
taxes. New technology introduced gasoline-powered farm tools such as tractors, seed drills, threshers,
and combine harvesters. Farmers were encouraged to plant large fields of a single crop to maximize
profits. With improved transportation and the invention of refrigeration, produce could be shipped
safely all over the world.
The Industrial Revolution modernized the world. With growing resources came growing societies
and economies. Between 1800 and 2000, the world’s population grew sixfold, while per capita income
saw a tenfold jump (Maddison 2003).
While many people's lives were improving, the Industrial Revolution also birthed many societal
problems. There were inequalities in the system. Owners amassed vast fortunes while laborers,
including young children, toiled for long hours in unsafe conditions. Workers’ rights, wage protection,
and safe work environments are issues that arose during this period and remain concerns today.
Postindustrial Societies and the Information Age
Postindustrial societies, also known as information societies, have evolved in modernized nations. One
of the most valuable goods of the modern era is information. Those who have the means to produce,
store, and disseminate information are leaders in this type of society.
One way scholars understand the development of different types of societies (like agricultural,
industrial, and postindustrial) is by examining their economies in terms of four sectors: primary,
secondary, tertiary, and quaternary. Each has a different focus. The primary sector extracts and produces
raw materials (like metals and crops). The secondary sector turns those raw materials into finished
goods. The tertiary sector provides services: child care, health care, and money management. Finally,
the quaternary sector produces ideas; these include the research that leads to new technologies, the
management of information, and a society’s highest levels of education and the arts (Kenessey 1987).
In underdeveloped countries, the majority of the people work in the primary sector. As economies
develop, more and more people are employed in the secondary sector. In well-developed economies,
such as those in the United States, Japan, and Western Europe, the majority of the workforce is
employed in service industries. In the United States, for example, almost 80 percent of the workforce is
employed in the tertiary sector (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics 2011).
The rapid increase in computer use in all aspects of daily life is a main reason for the transition to
an information economy. Fewer people are needed to work in factories because computerized robots
now handle many of the tasks. Other manufacturing jobs have been outsourced to less-developed
countries as a result of the developing global economy. The growth of the internet has created industries
that exist almost entirely online. Within industries, technology continues to change how goods are
produced. For instance, the music and film industries used to produce physical products like CDs and
DVDs for distribution. Now those goods are increasingly produced digitally and streamed or
downloaded at a much lower physical manufacturing cost. Information and the wherewithal to use it
creatively become commodities in a postindustrial economy.

CHAPTER 18 | WORK AND THE ECONOMY

Scholars don’t always agree on a single definition of capitalism. For our purposes, we will define
capitalism as an economic system in which there is private ownership (as opposed to state ownership)
and where there is an impetus to produce profit, and thereby wealth. This is the type of economy in
place in the United States today. Under capitalism, people invest capital (money or property invested in
a business venture) in a business to produce a product or service that can be sold in a market to
consumers. The investors in the company are generally entitled to a share of any profit made on sales
after the costs of production and distribution are taken out. These investors often reinvest their profits to
improve and expand the business or acquire new ones. To illustrate how this works, consider this
example. Sarah, Antonio, and Chris each invest $250,000 into a start-up company offering an
innovative baby product. When the company nets $1 million in profits its first year, a portion of that
profit goes back to Sarah, Antonio, and Chris as a return on their investment. Sarah reinvests with the
same company to fund the development of a second product line, Antonio uses his return to help
another start-up in the technology sector, and Chris buys a small yacht for vacations. The goal for all
parties is to maximize profits.
To provide their product or service, owners hire workers, to whom they pay wages. The cost of
raw materials, the retail price they charge consumers, and the amount they pay in wages are determined
through the law of supply and demand and by competition. When demand exceeds supply, prices tend
to rise. When supply exceeds demand, prices tend to fall. When multiple businesses market similar
products and services to the same buyers, there is competition. Competition can be good for consumers
because it can lead to lower prices and higher quality as businesses try to get consumers to buy from
them rather than from their competitors.
Wages tend to be set in a similar way. People who have talents, skills, education, or training that is
in short supply and is needed by businesses tend to earn more than people without comparable skills.
Competition in the workforce helps determine how much people will be paid. In times when many
people are unemployed and jobs are scarce, people are often willing to accept less than they would
when their services are in high demand. In this scenario, businesses are able to maintain or increase
profits by not paying increasing wages.
Capitalism in Practice
As capitalists began to dominate the economies of many countries during the Industrial Revolution, the
rapid growth of businesses and their tremendous profitability gave some owners the capital they needed
to create enormous corporations that could monopolize an entire industry. Many companies controlled
all aspects of the production cycle for their industry, from the raw materials to the production to the
stores in which they were sold. These companies were able to use their wealth to buy out or stifle any
competition.
In the United States, the predatory tactics used by these large monopolies caused the government
to take action. Starting in the late 1800s, the government passed a series of laws that broke up
monopolies and regulated how key industries—such as transportation, steel production, and oil and gas
exploration and refining—could conduct business.
The United States is considered a capitalist country. However, the U.S. government has a great
deal of influence on private companies through the laws it passes and the regulations enforced by
government agencies. Through taxes, regulations on wages, guidelines to protect worker safety and the
environment, plus financial rules for banks and investment firms, the government exerts a certain
amount of control over how all companies do business. State and federal governments also own,
operate, or control large parts of certain industries, such as the post office, schools, hospitals, highways
and railroads, and many water, sewer, and power utilities. Debate over the extent to which the
government should be involved in the economy remains an issue of contention today. Some criticize
such involvements as socialism (a type of state-run economy), while others believe intervention is
necessary to protect the rights of workers and the well-being of the general population.

CHAPTER 18 | WORK AND THE ECONOMY

Socialism

Figure 18.6 The economies of China and Russia after World War II are examples of one form of socialism. (Photo

Socialism is an economic system in which there is government ownership (often referred to as “state
run”) of goods and their production, with an impetus to share work and wealth equally among the
members of a society. Under socialism, everything that people produce, including services, is
considered a social product. Everyone who contributes to the production of a good or to providing a
service is entitled to a share in any benefits that come from its sale or use. To make sure all members of
society get their fair share, government must be able to control property, production, and distribution.
The focus in socialism is on benefitting society, whereas capitalism seeks to benefit the individual.
Socialists claim that a capitalistic economy leads to inequality, with unfair distribution of wealth and
individuals who use their power at the expense of society. Socialism strives, ideally, to control the
economy to avoid the problems inherent in capitalism.
Within socialism, there are diverging views on the extent to which the economy should be
controlled. One extreme believes all but the most personal items are public property. Other socialists
believe only essential services such as health care, education, and utilities (electrical power,
telecommunications, and sewage) need direct control. Under this form of socialism, farms, small shops,
and businesses can be privately owned but are subject to government regulation.

the other hand, criticize the way capitalism concentrates wealth in the hands of a few at the expense of many. (Photos (a), (b)
and (c) courtesy of Wikimedia Commons)

The other area on which socialists disagree is on what level society should exert its control. In
communist countries like the former Soviet Union, China, Vietnam, and North Korea, the national
government exerts control over the economy centrally. They had the power to tell all businesses what to
produce, how much to produce, and what to charge for it. Other socialists believe control should be
decentralized so it can be exerted by those most affected by the industries being controlled. An example
of this would be a town collectively owning and managing the businesses on which its populace
depends.
Because of challenges in their economies, several of these communist countries have moved from
central planning to letting market forces help determine many production and pricing decisions.
Market socialism describes a subtype of socialism that adopts certain traits of capitalism, like allowing
limited private ownership or consulting market demands. This could involve situations like profits
generated by a company going directly to the employees of the company or being used as public funds
(Gregory and Stuart 2003). Many Eastern European and some South American countries have mixed
economies. Key industries are nationalized and directly controlled by the government; however, most
businesses are privately owned and regulated by the government.
Organized socialism never became powerful in the United States. The success of labor unions and
the government in securing workers’ rights, joined with the high standard of living enjoyed by most of
the workforce, made socialism less appealing than the controlled capitalism practiced here.

duration that socialism prevailed. (Map courtesy of Wikimedia Commons)

Socialism in Practice
As with capitalism, the basic ideas behind socialism go far back in history. Plato, in ancient Greece,
suggested a republic in which people shared their material goods. Early Christian communities believed
in common ownership, as did the systems of monasteries set up by various religious orders. Many of
the leaders of the French Revolution called for the abolition of all private property, not just the estates
of the aristocracy they had overthrown. Thomas More's Utopia, published in 1516, imagined a society
with little private property and mandatory labor on a communal farm. Most experimental utopian
communities had the abolition of private property as a founding principle.

CHAPTER 18 | WORK AND THE ECONOMY

Modern socialism really began as a reaction to the excesses of uncontrolled industrial capitalism in
the 1800s and 1900s. The enormous wealth and lavish lifestyles enjoyed by owners contrasted sharply
with the miserable conditions of the workers.
Some of the first great sociological thinkers studied the rise of socialism. Max Weber admired
some aspects of socialism, especially its rationalism and how it could help social reform, but he worried
that letting the government have complete control could result in an "iron cage of future bondage"
(Greisman and Ritzer 1981).
Pierre-Joseph Proudon (1809−1865) was another early socialist who thought socialism could be
used to create utopian communities. In his 1840 book, What Is Property?, he famously stated that
“property is theft” (Proudon 1840). By this he meant that if an owner did not work to produce or earn
the property, then the owner was stealing it from those who did. Proudon believed economies could
work using a principle called mutualism, under which individuals and cooperative groups would
exchange products with one another on the basis of mutually satisfactory contracts (Proudon 1840).
By far the most important influential thinker on socialism was Karl Marx. Through his own
writings and those with his collaborator, industrialist Friedrich Engels, Marx used a scientific analytical
process to show that throughout history the resolution of class struggles caused changes in economies.
He saw the relationships evolving from slave and owner, to serf and lord, to journeyman and master, to
worker and owner. Neither Marx nor Engels thought socialism could be used to set up small utopian
communities. Rather, they believed a socialist society would be created after workers rebelled against
capitalistic owners and seized the means of production. They felt industrial capitalism was a necessary
step that raised the level of production in society to a point it could progress to a socialist state (Marx
and Engels 1848). These ideas formed the basis of the sociological perspective of social conflict theory.

Obama and Socialism: A Few Definitions
In the 2008 presidential election, the Republican Party latched onto what is often considered a
dirty word to describe then-Senator Barack Obama’s politics: socialist. It may have been because
the president was campaigning by telling workers it’s good for everybody when wealth gets spread
around. But whatever the reason, the label became a weapon of choice for Republicans during and
after the campaign. In 2012, Republican presidential contender Rick Perry continued this battle
cry. A New York Times article quotes him as telling a group of Republicans in Texas that President
Obama is “hell bent on taking America towards a socialist country” (Wheaton 2011). Meanwhile,
during the first few years of his presidency, Obama worked to create universal health care
coverage and pushed forth a partial takeover of the nation’s failing automotive industry. So does
this make him a socialist? What does that really mean, anyway?
There is more than one definition of socialism, but it generally refers to an economic or
political theory that advocates for shared or governmental ownership and administration of
production and distribution of goods. Often held up in counterpoint to capitalism, which
encourages private ownership and production, socialism is not typically an all-or-nothing plan. For
example, both the United Kingdom and France, as well as other European countries, have
socialized medicine, meaning that medical services are run nationally to reach as many people as
possible. These nations are, of course, still essentially capitalist countries with free-market
economies.
So is Obama a socialist because he wants universal health care? Or is the word a lightning rod
for conservatives who associate it with a lack of personal freedom? By almost any measure, the
answer is more the latter. A look at the politics of President Obama and Democrats in general
shows that there is, compared to most other free-market countries, very little limitation on private
ownership and production. What this is, instead, is an attempt to ensure that the United States, like
all other core nations, has a safety net for its poorest and most vulnerable. Although it might be in
Perry’s best interest to label this socialism, a study of the term makes it clear that it is untrue.
Voters can go to the polls confident that, whoever their choice of candidate may be, socialism is far
from finding a home in the United States.

CHAPTER 18 | WORK AND THE ECONOMY

Convergence Theory
We have seen how the economies of some capitalist countries such as the United States have features
that are very similar to socialism. Some industries, particularly utilities, are either owned by the
government or controlled through regulations. Public programs such as welfare, Medicare, and Social
Security exist to provide public funds for private needs. We have also seen how several large
communist (or formerly communist) countries such as Russia, China, and Vietnam have moved from
state-controlled socialism with central planning to market socialism, which allows market forces to
dictate prices and wages, and for some business to be privately owned. In many formerly communist
countries, these changes have led to economic growth compared to the stagnation they experienced
under communism (Fidrmuc 2002).
In studying the economies of developing countries to see if they go through the same stages as
previously developed nations did, sociologists have observed a pattern they call convergence. This
describes the theory that societies move toward similarity over time as their economies develop.
Convergence theory explains that as a country's economy grows, its societal organization changes
to become more like that of an industrialized society. Rather than staying in one job for a lifetime,
people begin to move from job to job as conditions improve and opportunities arise. This means the
workforce needs continual training and retraining. Workers move from rural areas to cities as they
become centers of economic activity, and the government takes a larger role in providing expanded
public services (Kerr et al. 1960).
Supporters of the theory point to Germany, France, and Japan—countries that rapidly rebuilt their
economies after World War II. They point out how, in the 1960s and 1970s, East Asian countries like
Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan converged with countries with developed economies. They are
now considered developed countries themselves.

European Union. (Map courtesy of Kolja21/Wikimedia Commons)

The theory is also known as the catch-up effect because the economies of poor countries that have
capital invested in them will generally grow faster than countries that are already wealthy. This allows
the income of poorer countries to "catch up" under the right conditions (“Catch-up Effect” 2011). To
experience this rapid growth, the economies of developing countries must to be able to attract
inexpensive capital to invest in new businesses and to improve traditionally low productivity. They
need access to new, international markets for buying the goods. If these characteristics are not in place,
then their economies cannot catch up. This is why the economies of some countries are diverging rather
than converging (Abramovitz 1986).
Another key characteristic of economic growth regards the implementation of technology. A
developing country can bypass some steps of implementing technology that other nations faced earlier.
Television and telephone systems are a good example. While developed countries spent significant time
and money establishing elaborate system infrastructures based on metal wires or fiber-optic cables,
developing countries today can go directly to cell phone and satellite transmission with much less
investment.
Another factor affects convergence concerning social structure. Early in their development,
countries such as Brazil and Cuba had economies based on cash crops (coffee or sugarcane, for
instance) grown on large plantations by unskilled workers. The elite ran the plantations and the
government, with little interest in training and educating the populace for other endeavors. This
retarded economic growth until the power of the wealthy plantation owners was challenged (Sokoloff
and Engerman 2000). Improved economies generally lead to wider social improvement. Society

benefits from improved educational systems, allowing people more time to devote to learning and
leisure.

Theoretical Perspectives on the Economy
Now that we’ve developed an understanding of the history and basic components of economies, let’s
turn to theory. How might social scientists study these topics? What questions do they ask? What
theories do they develop to add to the body of sociological knowledge?
Functionalist Perspective
Someone taking a functional perspective will most likely view work and the economy as a well-oiled
machine, designed for maximum efficiency. The Davis-Moore thesis, for example, suggests that some
social stratification is a social necessity. The need for certain highly skilled positions combined with the
relative difficulty of the occupation and the length of time it takes to qualify will result in a higher
reward for that job, providing a financial motivation to engage in more education and a more difficult
profession (Davis and Moore 1945). This theory can be used to explain the prestige and salaries that go
to those with doctorates or medical degrees.
Like any theory, this is subject to criticism. For example, the thesis fails to take into account the
many people who spend years on their education only to pursue work at a lower-paying position in a
nonprofit organization, or who teach high school after pursuing a PhD. It also fails to acknowledge the
effect of life changes and social networks on individual opportunities.
The functionalist perspective would assume that the continued health of the economy is vital to the
health of the nation, as it ensures the distribution of goods and services. For example, we need food to
travel from farms (high-functioning and efficient agricultural systems) via roads (safe and effective
trucking and rail routes) to urban centers (high-density areas where workers can gather). However,
sometimes a dysfunction––a function with the potential to disrupt social institutions or organization
(Merton 1968)––in the economy occurs, usually because some institutions fail to adapt quickly enough
to changing social conditions. This lesson has been driven home recently with the bursting of the
housing bubble. Due to irresponsible lending practices and an underregulated financial market, we are
currently living with the after-effects of a major dysfunction.
Some of this is cyclical. Markets produce goods as they are supposed to, but eventually the market
is saturated and the supply of goods exceeds the demands. Typically the market goes through phases of
surplus, or excess, inflation, where the money in your pocket today buys less than it did yesterday, and
recession, which occurs when there are two or more consecutive quarters of economic decline. The
functionalist would say to let market forces fluctuate in a cycle through these stages. In reality, to
control the risk of an economic depression (a sustained recession across several economic sectors), the
U.S. government will often adjust interest rates to encourage more spending. In short, letting the natural
cycle fluctuate is not a gamble most governments are willing to take.
Conflict Perspective
For a conflict perspective theorist, the economy is not a source of stability for society. Instead, the
economy reflects and reproduces economic inequality, particularly in a capitalist marketplace. The
conflict perspective is classically Marxist, with the bourgeoisie (ruling class) accumulating wealth and
power by exploiting the proletariat (workers), and regulating those who cannot work (the aged, the
infirm) into the great mass of unemployed (Marx and Engels 1848). From the symbolic (though
probably made up) statement of Marie Antoinette, who purportedly said “Let them eat cake” when told
that the peasants were starving, to the Occupy Wall Street movement, the sense of inequity is almost
unchanged. Both the people fighting in the French Revolution and those blogging from Zuccotti Park
believe the same thing: wealth is concentrated in the hands of those who do not deserve it. As of 2007,
20 percent of Americans owned 80 percent of U.S. wealth (Domhoff 2011). While the inequality might
not be as extreme as in pre-revolutionary France, it is enough to make many believe that the United
States is not the meritocracy it seems to be.
Symbolic Interactionist Perspective
Those working in the symbolic interaction perspective take a microanalytical view of society, focusing
on the way reality is socially constructed through day-to-day interaction and how society is composed
of people communicating based on a shared understanding of symbols.
One important symbolic interactionist concept related to work and the economy is career
inheritance. This concept means simply that children tend to enter the same or similar occupation as
their parents, a correlation that has been demonstrated in research studies (Antony 1998). For example,
the children of police officers learn the norms and values that will help them succeed in law

407

408

CHAPTER 18 | WORK AND THE ECONOMY

enforcement, and since they have a model career path to follow, they may find law enforcement even
more attractive. Related to career inheritance is career socialization, learning the norms and values of a
particular job.
Finally, a symbolic interactionist might study what contributes to job satisfaction. Melving Kohn
and his fellow researchers (1990) determined that workers were most likely to be happy when they
believed they controlled some part of their work, when they felt they were part of the decision-making
processes associated with their work, when they have freedom from surveillance, and when they felt
integral to the outcome of their work. Sunyal, Sunyal, and Yasin (2011) found that a greater sense of
vulnerability to stress, the more stress experienced by a worker, and a greater amount of perceived risk
consistently predicted a lower worker job satisfaction.

18.2 Globalization and the Economy

countries such as India, where their costs are lowest. (Photo courtesy of Wikimedia Commons)

What Is Globalization?
Globalization refers to the process of integrating governments, cultures, and financial markets through
international trade into a single “world market.” Often, the process begins with a single motive, such as
market expansion (on the part of a corporation) or increased access to health care (on the part of a
nonprofit organization). But usually there is a snowball effect, and globalization becomes a mixed bag
of economic, philanthropic, entrepreneurial, and cultural efforts. Sometimes the efforts have obvious
benefits, even for those who worry about cultural colonialism, such as campaigns to bring clean-water
technology to rural areas without access to safe drinking water.
Other globalization efforts, however, are more complex. Let us look, for example, at the free-trade
agreement known as NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement). The agreement is among the
countries of North America, including Canada, the United States, and Mexico, allowing much freer
trade opportunities without the kind of tariffs (taxes) and import laws that restrict international trade.
Often, trade opportunities are misrepresented by politicians and economists, who sometimes offer them
up as a panacea to economic woes. For example, trade can lead to both increases and decreases in job
opportunities. This is because while easier, more lax export laws mean there is the potential for job
growth in the U.S., imports can mean the exact opposite. As Americans import more goods from
outside the country, jobs typically decrease, as more and more products are made overseas.
Many prominent economists believed that when NAFTA was created in 1994 it would lead to
major gains in jobs. But by 2010, the evidence showed an opposite impact; the data showed 682,900
U.S. jobs lost across all states (Parks 2011). While NAFTA did increase the flow of goods and capital
across the northern and southern U.S. borders, it also increased unemployment in Mexico, spurring
greater amounts of illegal immigration motivated by a search for work.
There are several forces driving globalization, including the global economy and multinational
corporations that control assets, sales, production, and employment (United Nations 1973).
Characteristics of multinational corporations include the following: A large share of their capital is
collected from a variety of different nations, their business is conducted without regard to national
borders, they concentrate wealth in the hands of core nations and already wealthy individuals, and they
play a key role in the global economy.
There are several components to the global economy and many changes that occur as countries
grow more interdependent. First, there is an increasing number of global cities, which
1. headquarter multinational corporations, such as Coca-Cola
2. exercise significant international political influence, such as what comes from Beijing or Berlin
3. host headquarters of international nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) such as the United
Nations
4. host influential media such as the BBC and Al Jazeera

CHAPTER 18 | WORK AND THE ECONOMY

5. host advanced communication and transportation infrastructure, such as is seen in Shanghai
(Sassen 2001)
Second, we see the emergence of global assembly lines, where products are assembled over the
course of several international transactions. For instance, Apple designs its next-generation Mac
prototype in the United States, components are made in various peripheral nations, they are then
shipped to another peripheral nation such as Malaysia for assembly, and tech support is outsourced to
India.
Globalization has also led to the development of global commodity chains, where internationally
integrated economic links connect workers and corporations for the purpose of manufacture and
marketing (Plahe 2005). For example, in maquiladoras, mostly found in northern Mexico,workers may
sew imported precut pieces of fabric into garments.
Globalization also brings an international division of labor, in which comparatively wealthy
workers from core nations compete with the low-wage labor pool of peripheral and semi-peripheral
nations. This can lead to a sense of xenophobia, which is an illogical fear and even hatred of foreigners
and foreign goods. Corporations trying to maximize their profits in the United States are conscious of
this risk and attempt to “Americanize” their products, selling shirts printed with U.S. flags that were
nevertheless made in Mexico.

Aspects of Globalization
Globalized trade is nothing new. Societies in ancient Greece and Rome traded with other societies in
Africa, the Middle East, India, and China. Trade expanded further during the Islamic Golden Age and
after the rise of the Mongol Empire. The establishment of colonial empires after the voyages of
discovery by European countries meant that trade was going on all over the world. In the 19th century,
the Industrial Revolution led to even more trade of ever-increasing amounts of goods. However, the
advance of technology, especially communications, after World War II and the Cold War triggered the
explosive acceleration in the process occurring today.
One way to look at the similarities and differences that exist among the economies of different
nations is to compare their standards of living. The statistic most commonly used to do this is the
domestic process per capita. This is the gross domestic product, or GDP, of a country divided by its
population. The table below compares the top 11 countries with the bottom 11 out of the 228 countries
listed in the CIA World Factbook.

There are benefits and drawbacks to globalization. Some of the benefits include the exponentially
accelerated progress of development, the creation of international awareness and empowerment, and the
potential for increased wealth (Abedian 2002). However, experience has shown that countries can also
be weakened by globalization. Some critics of globalization worry about the growing influence of
enormous international financial and industrial corporations that benefit the most from free trade and
unrestricted markets. They fear these corporations can use their vast wealth and resources to control
governments to act in their interest rather than that of the local population (Bakan 2004). Indeed, when
looking at the countries at the bottom of the list above, we are looking at places where the primary
benefactors of mineral exploitation are major corporations and a few key political figures. Nigeria, for
example, is a country that produces tens of billions of dollars in oil revenue, but the money does not go
to the country’s people.
Other critics oppose globalization for what they see as negative impacts on the environment and
local economies. Rapid industrialization, often a key component of globalization, can lead to
widespread economic damage due to the lack of regulatory environment (Speth 2003). Further, as there
are often no social institutions in place to protect workers in countries where jobs are scarce, some
critics state that globalization leads to weak labor movements (Boswell and Stevis 1997). Finally, critics
are concerned that wealthy countries can force economically weaker nations to open their markets
while protecting their own local products from competition (Wallerstein 1974). This can be particularly
true of agricultural products, which are often one of the main exports of poor and developing countries
(Koroma 2007). In a 2007 article for the United Nations, Koroma discusses the difficulties faced by
“least developed countries” (LDCs) that seek to participate in globalization efforts. These countries

CHAPTER 18 | WORK AND THE ECONOMY

typically lack the infrastructure to be flexible and nimble in their production and trade, and therefore are
vulnerable to everything from unfavorable weather conditions to international price volatility. In short,
rather than offering them more opportunities, the increased competition and fast pace of a globalized
market can make it more challenging than ever for LDCs to move forward (Koroma 2007).
The increasing use of outsourcing of manufacturing and service-industry jobs to developing
countries has caused increased unemployment in some developed countries. Countries that do not
develop new jobs to replace those that move, and train their labor force to do them, will find support for
globalization weakening.

18.3 Work in the United States

The American Dream has always been based on opportunity. There is a great deal of mythologizing
about the energetic upstart who can climb to success based on hard work alone. Common wisdom states
that if you study hard, develop good work habits, and graduate high school or, even better, college, then
you'll have the opportunity to land a good job. That has long been seen as the key to a successful life.
And although the reality has always been more complex than suggested by the myth, the worldwide
recession that began in 2008 has made it harder than ever to play by the rules and win the game. The
data are grim: From December 2007 through March 2010, 8.2 million workers in the United States lost
their jobs, and the unemployment rate grew to almost 10 percent nationally, with some states showing
much higher rates (Autor 2010). Times are very challenging for those in the workforce. For those
looking to finish their schooling, often with enormous student-debt burdens, it is not just
challenging—it is terrifying.
So where did all the jobs go? Will any of them be coming back, and if not, what new ones will
there be? How do you find and keep a good job now? These are the kinds of questions people are
currently asking about the job market in the United States.

Real Money, Virtual Worlds

Figure 18.12 In a virtual world, living the good life still costs real money. (Photo courtesy of Juan Pablo Amo/flickr)
If you are not one of the tens of millions gamers who enjoy World of Warcraft or other online
virtual world games, you might not even know what MMORPG stands for. But if you made a
living playing MMORPGs, as a growing number of enterprising gamers do, then massive
multiplayer online role-playing games might matter a bit more. According to an article in Forbes
magazine, the online world of gaming has been yielding very real profits for entrepreneurs who are
able to buy, sell, and manage online real estate, currency, and more for cash (Holland and Ewalt
2006). If it seems strange that people would pay real money for imaginary goods, consider that for
serious gamers the online world is of equal importance to the real one.
These entrepreneurs can sell items because the gaming sites have introduced scarcity into the
virtual worlds. The game makers have realized that MMORPGs lack tension without a level of
scarcity for needed resources or highly desired items. In other words, if anyone can have a palace
or a vault full of wealth, then what’s the fun?
So how does it work? One of the easiest ways to make such a living is called gold farming,
which involves hours of repetitive and boring play, hunting and shooting animals like dragons that
carry a lot of wealth. This virtual wealth can be sold on eBay for real money: a timesaver for
players who don’t want to waste their playing time on boring pursuits. Players in parts of Asia
engage in gold farming, playing eight hours a day or more, to sell their gold to players in Western
Europe or North America. From virtual prostitutes to power levelers (people who play the game
logged in as you so your characters get the wealth and power), to architects, merchants, and even
beggars, online players can offer to sell any service or product that others want to buy. Whether
buying a magic carpet in World of Warcraft or a stainless-steel kitchen appliance in Second Life,
gamers have the same desire to acquire as the rest of us—never mind that their items are virtual.
Once a gamer creates the code for an item, she can sell it again and again, for real money. And
finally, you can sell yourself. According to Forbes, a University of Virginia computer science
student sold his World of Warcraft character on eBay for $1,200, due to the high levels of powers
and skills it had gained (Holland and Ewalt 2006).
So should you quit your day job to make a killing in online games? Probably not. Those who
work hard might eke out a decent living, but for most people, grabbing up land that doesn’t really
exist or selling your body in animated action scenes is probably not the best opportunity. Still, for
some, it offers the ultimate in work-from-home flexibility, even if that home is a mountain cave in
a virtual world.

Polarization in the Workforce
The mix of jobs available in the United States began changing many years before the recession struck,
and, as mentioned above, the American dream has not always been easy to follow. Geography, race,
gender, and other factors have always played a role in the reality of success. More recently, the
increased outsourcing (or contracting a job or set of jobs to an outside source) of manufacturing jobs to
developing nations has greatly diminished the number of high-paying, often unionized, blue-collar
positions available. A similar problem has arisen in the white-collar sector, with many low-level clerical

CHAPTER 18 | WORK AND THE ECONOMY

and support positions also being outsourced, as evidenced by the international technical-support call
centers in Mumbai, India, and Newfoundland, Canada. The number of supervisory and managerial
positions has been reduced as companies streamline their command structures and industries continue
to consolidate through mergers. Even highly educated skilled workers such as computer programmers
have seen their jobs vanish overseas.
The automation (replacing workers with technology) of the workplace is another cause of the
changes in the job market. Computers can be programmed to do many routine tasks faster and less
expensively than people who used to do such tasks. Jobs like bookkeeping, clerical work, and repetitive
tasks on production assembly lines all lend themselves to automation. Think about the newer automated
toll passes we can install in our cars. Toll collectors are just one of the many endangered jobs that will
soon cease to exist.
Despite all this, the job market is actually growing in some areas, but in a very polarized fashion.
Polarization means that a gap has developed in the job market, with most employment opportunities at
the lowest and highest levels and few jobs for those with midlevel skills and education. At one end,
there has been strong demand for low-skilled, low-paying jobs in industries like food service and retail.
On the other end, some research shows that in certain fields there has been a steadily increasing demand
for highly skilled and educated professionals, technologists, and managers. These high-skilled positions
also tend to be highly paid (Autor 2010).
The fact that some positions are highly paid while others are not is an example of the class system,
an economic hierarchy in which movement (both upward and downward) between various rungs of the
socioeconomic ladder is possible. Theoretically, at least, the class system as it is organized in the United
States is an example of a meritocracy, an economic system that rewards merit––typically in the form of
skill and hard work––with upward mobility. A theorist working in the functionalist perspective might
point out that this system is designed to reward hard work, which encourages people to strive for
excellence in pursuit of reward. A theorist working in the conflict perspective might counter with the
thought that hard work does not guarantee success even in a meritocracy, because social capital––the
accumulation of a network of social relationships and knowledge that will provide a platform from
which to achieve financial success––in the form of connections or higher education are often required
to access the high-paying jobs. Increasingly, we are realizing intelligence and hard work aren’t enough.
If you lack knowledge of how to leverage the right names, connections, and players, you are unlikely to
experience upward mobility.
With so many jobs being outsourced or eliminated by automation, what kind of jobs are there a
demand for in the United States? While fishing and forestry jobs are in decline, in several markets jobs
are increasing. These include community and social service, personal care and service, finance,
computer and information services, and health care. The chart below, from the U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics, illustrates areas of projected growth.

413

414

CHAPTER 18 | WORK AND THE ECONOMY

Figure 18.13 This chart shows the projected growth of several occupational groups. (Graph courtesy of the Bureau of
Labor Statistics Occupational Outlook Handbook)

The professional and related jobs, which include any number of positions, typically require
significant education and training and tend to be lucrative career choices. Service jobs, according to the
Bureau of Labor Statistics, can include everything from jobs with the fire department to jobs scooping
ice cream (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2010). There is a wide variety of training needed, and therefore an
equally large wage potential discrepancy. One of the largest areas of growth by industry, rather than by
occupational group (as seen above), is in the health field. This growth is across occupations, from
associate-level nurse’s aides to management-level assisted-living staff. As baby boomers age, they are
living longer than any generation before, and the growth of this population segment requires an increase
in capacity throughout our country’s elder care system, from home health care nursing to geriatric
nutrition.
Notably, jobs in farming are in decline. This is an area where those with less education
traditionally could be assured of finding steady, if low-wage, work. With these jobs disappearing, more
and more workers will find themselves untrained for the types of employment that are available.
Another projected trend in employment relates to the level of education and training required to
gain and keep a job. As the chart below shows us, growth rates are higher for those with more
education. Those with a professional degree or a master’s degree may expect job growth of 20 and 22
percent respectively, and jobs that require a bachelor’s degree are projected to grow 17 percent. At the
other end of the spectrum, jobs that require a high school diploma or equivalent are projected to grow at
only 12 percent, while jobs that require less than a high school diploma will grow 14 percent. Quite
simply, without a degree, it will be more difficult to find a job. It is worth noting that these projections
are based on overall growth across all occupation categories, so obviously there will be variations
within different occupational areas. However, once again, those who are the least educated will be the
ones least able to fulfill the American Dream.

CHAPTER 18 | WORK AND THE ECONOMY

Figure 18.14 More education means more jobs (generally). (Graph courtesy of the Bureau of Labor Statistics
Occupational Outlook Handbook)

In the past, rising education levels in the United States had been able to keep pace with the rise in
the number of education-dependent jobs. However, since the late 1970s, men have been enrolling in
college at a lower rate than women, and graduating at a rate of almost 10 percent less. The lack of male
candidates reaching the education levels needed for skilled positions has opened opportunities for
women, minorities, and immigrants (Wang 2011).

Women in the Workforce
Women have been entering the workforce in ever-increasing numbers for several decades. They have
also been finishing college and going on to earn higher degrees at higher rate than men do. This has
resulted in many women being better positioned to obtain high-paying, high-skill jobs (Autor 2010).
While women are getting more and better jobs and their wages are rising more quickly than men's
wages are, U.S. Census statistics show that they are still earning only 77 percent of what men are for
the same positions (U.S. Census Bureau 2010).

Immigration and the Workforce
Simply put, people will move from where there are few or no jobs to places where there are jobs, unless
something prevents them from doing so. The process of moving to a country is called immigration. Due
to its reputation as the land of opportunity, the United States has long been the destination of all skill
levels of workers. While the rate decreased somewhat during the economic slowdown of 2008,
immigrants, both legal and illegal, continue to be a major part of the U.S. workforce.
In 2005, before the recession arrived, immigrants made up a historic high of 14.7 percent of the
workforce (Lowell et al. 2006). During the 1970s through 2000s, the United States experienced both an
increase in college-educated immigrants and in immigrants who lacked a high school diploma. With
this range across the spectrum, immigrants are well positioned for both the higher-paid jobs and the
low-wage low-skill jobs that are predicted to grow in the next decade (Lowell et al. 2006). In the early
2000s, it certainly seemed that the United States was continuing to live up to its reputation of
opportunity. But what about during the recession of 2008, when so many jobs were lost and
unemployment hovered close to 10 percent? How did immigrant workers fare then?
The answer is that as of June 2009, when the National Bureau of Economic Research (NEBR)
declared the recession officially over, “foreign-born workers gained 656,000 jobs while native-born
workers lost 1.2 million jobs” (Kochhar 2010). As these numbers suggest, the unemployment rate that
year decreased for immigrant workers and increased for native workers. The reasons for this trend are
not entirely clear. Some Pew research suggests immigrants tend to have greater flexibility to move from
job to job and that the immigrant population may have been early victims of the recession, and thus
were quicker to rebound (Kochhar 2010). Regardless of the reasons, the 2009 job gains are far from
enough to keep them inured from the country’s economic woes. Immigrant earnings are in decline, even
as the number of jobs increases, and some theorize that increase in employment may come from a
willingness to accept significantly lower wages and benefits.
While the political debate is often fueled by conversations about low-wage-earning immigrants,
there are actually as many highly skilled––and high-earning––immigrant workers as well. Many

415

416

CHAPTER 18 | WORK AND THE ECONOMY

immigrants are sponsored by their employers who claim they possess talents, education, and training
that are in short supply in the U.S. These sponsored immigrants account for 15 percent of all legal
immigrants (Batalova and Terrazas 2010). Interestingly, the U.S. population generally supports these
high-level workers, believing they will help lead to economic growth and not be a drain on government
services (Hainmueller and Hiscox 2010). On the other hand, illegal immigrants tend to be trapped in
extremely low-paying jobs in agriculture, service, and construction with few ways to improve their
situation without risking exposure and deportation.

Poverty in the United States
When people lose their jobs during a recession or in a changing job market, it takes longer to find a new
one, if they can find one at all. If they do, it is often at a much lower wage or not full time. This can
force people into poverty. In the United States, we tend to have what is called relative poverty, defined
as being unable to live the lifestyle of the average person in your country. This must be contrasted with
the absolute poverty that can be found in underdeveloped countries, defined as being barely able, or
unable, to afford basic necessities such as food (Byrns 2011).
We cannot even rely on unemployment statistics to provide a clear picture of total unemployment
in the United States. First, unemployment statistics do not take into account underemployment, a state
in which a person accepts a lower paying, lower status job than their education and experience qualifies
them to perform. Second, unemployment statistics only count those:
1. who are actively looking for work
2. who have not earned income from a job in the past four weeks
3. who are ready, willing, and able to work
The unemployment statistics provided by the U.S. government are rarely accurate, because many
of the unemployed become discouraged and stop looking for work. Not only that, but these statistics
undercount the youngest and oldest workers, the chronically unemployed (e.g., homeless), and seasonal
and migrant workers.
A certain amount of unemployment is a direct result of the relative inflexibility of the labor
market, considered structural unemployment, which describes when there is a societal level of
disjuncture between people seeking jobs and the available jobs. This mismatch can be geographic (they
are hiring in California, but most unemployed live in Alabama), technological (skilled workers are
replaced by machines, as in the auto industry), or can result from any sudden change in the types of jobs
people are seeking versus the types of companies that are hiring.
Because of the high standard of living in the United States, many people are working at full-time
jobs but are still poor by the standards of relative poverty. They are the working poor. The United States
has a higher percentage of working poor than many other developed countries (Brady, Fullerton and
Cross 2010). In terms of employment, the Bureau of Labor Statistics defines the working poor as those
who have spent at least 27 weeks working or looking for work, and yet remain below the poverty line.
Many of the facts about the working poor are as expected: Those who work only part time are more
likely to be classified as working poor than those with full-time employment; higher levels of education
lead to less likelihood of being among the working poor; and those with children under 18 are four
times more likely than those without children to fall into this category. In 2009, the working poor
included 10.4 million Americans, up almost 17 percent from 2008 (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
2011).

developed nations.

an increasing number of children are living in poverty. (Graph courtesy of the U.S. Census Bureau,Current Population Survey,
1960 to 2011, Annual Social and Economic Supplements)

Most developed countries such as the United States protect their citizens from absolute poverty by
providing different levels of social services such as unemployment insurance, welfare, food stamps, and
so on. They may also provide job training and retraining so that people can reenter the job market. In
the past, the elderly were particularly vulnerable to falling into poverty after they stopped working;
however, pensions, retirement plans, and Social Security were designed to help prevent this. A major
concern in the United States is the rising number of young people growing up in poverty. Growing up
poor can cut off access to the education and services people need to move out of poverty and into stable
employment. As we saw, more education was often a key to stability, and those raised in poverty are the
ones least able to find well-paying work, perpetuating a cycle.
There is great debate about how much support local, state, and federal governments should give to
help the unemployed and underemployed. The decisions made on these issues will have a profound
effect on working in the United States.

Section Summary
18.1 Economic Systems
Economy refers to the social institution through which a society’s resources (goods and services) are
managed. The Agricultural Revolution led to development of the first economies that were based on
trading goods. Mechanization of the manufacturing process led to the Industrial Revolution and gave
rise to two major competing economic systems. Under capitalism, private owners invest their capital
and that of others to produce goods and services they can sell in an open market. Prices and wages are
set by supply and demand and competition. Under socialism, the means of production is commonly
owned, and the economy is controlled centrally by government. Several countries’ economies exhibit a
mix of both systems. Convergence theory seeks to explain the correlation between a country’s level of
development and changes in its economic structure.

18.2 Globalization and the Economy
Globalization refers to the process of integrating governments, cultures, and financial markets through
international trade into a single “world market.” There are benefits and drawbacks to globalization.
Often the countries that fare the worst are those that depend on natural resource extraction for their
wealth. Many critics fear globalization gives too much power to multinational corporations and that
political decisions are influenced by these major financial players.

18.3 Work in the United States
The job market in the United States is meant to be a meritocracy that creates social stratifications based
on individual achievement. Economic forces, such as outsourcing and automation, are polarizing the
workforce, with most job opportunities being either low-level, low-paying manual jobs or high-level,
high-paying jobs based on abstract skills. Women's role in the workforce has increased, although they
have not yet achieved full equality. Immigrants play an important role in the U.S. labor market. The
changing economy has forced more people into poverty even if they are working. Welfare, Social
Security, and other social programs exist to protect people from the worst effects of poverty.

CHAPTER 19 | HEALTH AND MEDICINE

Introduction to Health and Medicine
In 2010, a pertussis (whooping cough) outbreak in California sickened 9,143 people and resulted in 10
infant deaths: the worst outbreak in 63 years (Centers for Disease Control 2011b). Researchers,
suspecting that the primary cause of the outbreak was the waning strength of pertussis vaccines in older
children, recommended a booster vaccination for 11–12-year-olds and also for pregnant women
(Zacharyczuk 2011). Pertussis is most serious for babies; one in five needs to be hospitalized, and since
they are too young for the vaccine themselves, it is crucial that people around them be immunized
(Centers for Disease Control 2011b). Several states, including California, have been requiring the
pertussis booster for older children in recent yearswith the hope of staving off another outbreak.
But what of people who do not want their children to have this vaccine, or any other? That
question is at the heart of a debate that has been simmering for years. Vaccines are biological
preparations that improve immunity against a certain disease. Vaccines have contributed to the
eradication and weakening of numerous infectious diseases, including smallpox, polio, mumps, chicken
pox, and meningitis.
However, many people express concern about potential negative side effects from vaccines. These
concerns range from fears about overloading the child’s immune system to controversial reports about
devastating side effects of the vaccines. One misapprehension is that the vaccine itself might cause the
disease it is supposed to be immunizing against. Another commonly circulated concern is that
vaccinations, specifically the MMR vaccine (MMR stands for measles, mumps, and rubella), are linked
to autism. The autism connection has been particularly controversial. In 1998, a British physician
named Andrew Wakefield published a study in Great Britain’s Lancet magazine that linked the MMR
vaccine to autism. The report received a lot of media attention, resulting in British immunization rates
decreasing from 91 percent in 1997 to almost 80 percent by 2003, accompanied by a subsequent rise in
measles cases (Devlin 2008). A prolonged investigation by the British Medical Journal proved that not
only was the link in the study nonexistent, but that Dr. Wakefield had falsified data in order to support
his claims (CNN 2011). Dr. Wakefield was discredited and stripped of his license, but the doubt still
lingers in many parents’ minds.
In the United States, many parents still believe in the now discredited MMR-autism link and refuse
to vaccinate their children. Other parents choose not to vaccinate for various reasons like religious or
health beliefs. In one instance, a boy whose parents opted not to vaccinate returned home to the U.S.
after a trip abroad; no one yet knew he was infected with measles. The boy exposed 839 people to the
disease and caused 11 additional cases of measles, all in other unvaccinated children, including one
infant who had to be hospitalized. According to a study published in Pediatrics (2010), the outbreak
cost the public sector $10,376 per diagnosed case. The study further showed that the intentional nonvaccination of those infected occurred in students from private schools, public charter schools, and
public schools in upper-socioeconomic areas (Sugerman et al. 2010).
Should parents be forced to immunize their children? What might sociologists make of the fact
that most of the families who chose not to vaccinate were of a higher socioeconomic group? How does
this story of vaccines in a high-income region compare to that in a low-income region, like sub-Saharan
Africa, where populations are often eagerly seeking vaccines rather than refusing them?
The sociology of health encompasses social epidemiology, disease, mental health, disability, and
medicalization. The way that we perceive health and illness is in constant evolution. As we learn to
control existing diseases, new diseases develop. As our society evolves to be more global, the way that
diseases spread evolves with it.
What does “health” mean to you? Do you believe that there are too many people taking
medications in American society? Are you skeptical about people claiming they are “addicted” to
gambling or “addicted” to sex? Can you think of anything that was historically considered a disease, but
is now considered within a range of normality? Or anything that has recently become known as a
disease, whereas before it was considered evidence of laziness or other character flaws? Do you believe
all children should receive vaccinations? These are questions examined in the sociology of health.
Sociologists may also understand these issues more fully by considering them through one of the
main theoretical perspectives of the discipline. The functionalist perspective is a macroanalytical
perspective that looks at the big picture, focusing on the way that all aspects of society are integral to
the continued health and viability of the whole. For those working within the functionalist perspective,
the focus is on how healthy individuals have the most to contribute to the stability of society.
Functionalists might study the most efficient way to restore “sick” individuals to a healthy state. The
conflict perspective is another macroanalytical perspective that focuses on the creation and
reproduction of inequality. Someone applying the conflict perspective might focus on inequalities

CHAPTER 19 | HEALTH AND MEDICINE

within the health system itself, looking at disparities in race, ethnicity, gender, and age. Someone
applying the interactionist perspective to health might focus on how people understand their health, and
how their health affects their relationships with the people in their lives.

19.1 The Social Construction of Health
If sociology is the systematic study of human behavior in society, medical sociology is the systematic
study of how humans manage issues of health and illness, disease and disorders, and health care for
both the sick and the healthy. Medical sociologists study the physical, mental, and social components of
health and illness. Major topics for medical sociologists include the doctor/patient relationship, the
structure and socioeconomics of health care, and how culture impacts attitudes toward disease and
wellness.
The social construction of health is a major research topic within medical sociology. At first
glance, the concept of a social construction of health does not seem to make sense. After all, if disease
is a measurable, physiological problem, then there can be no question of socially constructing disease,
right? Well, it’s not that simple. The idea of the social construction of health emphasizes the sociocultural aspects of the discipline’s approach to physical, objectively definable phenomena. Sociologists
Conrad and Barker (2010) offer a comprehensive framework for understanding the major findings of
the last 50 years of development in this concept. Their summary categorizes the findings in the field
under three subheadings: the cultural meaning of illness, the social construction of the illness
experience, and the social construction of medical knowledge.

The Cultural Meaning of Illness
Many medical sociologists contend that illnesses have both a biological and an experiential component,
and that these components exist independently of each other. Our culture, not our biology, dictates
which illnesses are stigmatized and which are not, which are considered disabilities and which are not,
and which are deemed contestable (meaning some medical professionals may find the existence of this
ailment questionable) as opposed to definitive (illnesses that are unquestionably recognized in the
medical profession) (Conrad and Barker 2010).
For instance, sociologist Erving Goffman (1963) described how social stigmas hinder individuals
from fully integrating into society. The stigmatization of illness often has the greatest effect on the
patient and the kind of care he or she receives. Many contend that our society and even our health care
institutions discriminate against certain diseases—like mental disorders, AIDS, venereal diseases, and
skin disorders (Sartorius 2007). Facilities for these diseases may be sub-par; they may be segregated
from other health care areas or relegated to a poorer environment. The stigma may keep people from
seeking help for their illness, making it worse than it needs to be.
Contested illnesses are those that are questioned or questionable by some medical professionals.
Disorders like fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome may be either true illnesses or only in the
patients’ heads, depending on the opinion of the medical professional. This dynamic can affect how a
patient seeks treatment and what kind of treatment he or she receives.

The Social Construction of the Illness Experience
The idea of the social construction of the illness experience is based on the concept of reality as a social
construction. In other words, there is no objective reality; there are only our own perceptions of it. The
social construction of the illness experience deals with such issues as the way some patients control the
manner in which they reveal their disease and the lifestyle adaptations patients develop to cope with
their illnesses.
In terms of constructing the illness experience, culture and individual personality both play a
significant role. For some people, a long-term illness can have the effect of making their world smaller,
more defined by the illness than anything else. For others, illness can be a chance for discovery, for reimaging a new self (Conrad and Barker 2007). Culture plays a huge role in how an individual
experiences illness. Widespread diseases like AIDS or breast cancer have specific cultural markers that
have changed over the years and that govern how individuals—and society—view them.
Today, many institutions of wellness acknowledge the degree to which individual perceptions
shape the nature of health and illness. Regarding physical activity, for instance, the Centers for Disease
Control (CDC) recommends that individuals use a standard level of exertion to assess their physical
activity. This Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) gives a more complete view of an individual’s actual
exertion level, since heart-rate or pulse measurements may be affected by medication or other issues

427

428

CHAPTER 19 | HEALTH AND MEDICINE

(Centers for Disease Control 2011a). Similarly, many medical professionals use a comparable scale for
perceived pain to help determine pain management strategies.

Figure 19.2 The Mosby pain rating scale helps health care providers assess an individual’s level of pain. What might a
symbolic interactionist observe about this method? (Photo courtesy of wrestlingentropy/flickr)

The Social Construction of Medical Knowledge
Conrad and Barker show how medical knowledge is socially constructed; that is, it can both reflect and
reproduce inequalities in gender, class, race, and ethnicity. Conrad and Barker (2011) use the example
of the social construction of women’s health and how medical knowledge has changed significantly in
the course of a few generations. For instance, in the early 19th century, pregnant women were
discouraged from driving or dancing for fear of harming the unborn child, much as they are discouraged
from smoking or drinking alcohol today.

Has Breast Cancer Awareness Gone Too Far?

Figure 19.3 Pink ribbons are a ubiquitous reminder of breast cancer. But do pink ribbon chocolates do anything to
eradicate the disease? (Photo courtesy of wishuponacupcake/Wikimedia Commons)

Every October, the world turns pink. Football and baseball players wear pink accessories.
Skyscrapers and large public buildings are lit with pink lights at night. And for retailers, shoppers
can choose from a huge array of pink products. In 2011, people wanting to support the fight
against breast cancer could purchase any of the following pink products: KitchenAid mixers,
Master Lock padlocks and bike chains, Wilson tennis rackets, Fiat cars, and Smith & Wesson
handguns. You read that correctly. The goal of all these pink products is to raise awareness and
money for breast cancer. However, the relentless creep of pink has many people wondering if the
pink marketing juggernaut has gone too far.
Pink has been associated with breast cancer since 1991, when the Susan G. Komen
Foundation handed out pink ribbons at its 1991 Race for the Cure event. Since then, the pink
ribbon has appeared on countless products, and then by extension, the color pink has come to
represent support for a cure of the disease. No one can argue about the Susan G. Komen

CHAPTER 19 | HEALTH AND MEDICINE

Foundation’s mission—find a cure for breast cancer—or the fact that the group has raised millions
of dollars for research and care. However, some people question if, or how much, all these
products really help in the fight against breast cancer (Begos 2011).
The advocacy group Breast Cancer Action (BCA) position themselves as watchdogs of other
agencies fighting breast cancer. They accept no funding from entities, like those in the
pharmaceutical industry, with potential profit connections to this health industry. They’ve
developed a trademarked “Think Before You Pink” campaign to provoke consumer questioning of
the end contributions made to breast cancer by companies hawking pink wares. They do not advise
against “pink” purchases; they just want consumers to be informed about how much money is
involved, where it comes from, and where it will go. For instance, what percentage of each
purchase goes to breast cancer causes? BCA does not judge how much is enough, but it informs
customers and then encourages them to consider whether they feel the amount is enough (Think
Before You Pink 2012).
BCA also suggests that consumers make sure that the product they are buying does not
actually contribute to breast cancer, a phenomenon they call “pinkwashing.” This issue made
national headlines in 2010, when the Susan G. Komen Foundation partnered with Kentucky Fried
Chicken (KFC) on a promotion called “Buckets for the Cure.” For every bucket of grilled or
regular fried chicken, KFC would donate 50 cents to the Komen Foundation, with the goal of
reaching $8 million: the largest single donation received by the foundation. However, some critics
saw the partnership as an unholy alliance. Higher body fat and eating fatty foods has been linked
to increased cancer risks, and detractors, including BCA, called the Komen Foundation out on this
apparent contradiction of goals. Komen’s response was that the program did a great deal to raise
awareness in low-income communities, where Komen previously had little outreach (Hutchison
2010).
What do you think? Are fundraising and awareness important enough to trump issues of
health? What other examples of “pinkwashing” can you think of?

19.2 Global Health
Social epidemiology is the study of the causes and distribution of diseases. Social epidemiology can
reveal how social problems are connected to the health of different populations. These epidemiological
studies show that the health problems of high-income nations differ greatly from those of low-income
nations. Some diseases, like cancer, are universal. But others, like obesity, heart disease, respiratory
disease, and diabetes are much more common in high-income countries, and are a direct result of a
sedentary lifestyle combined with poor diet. High-income nations also have a higher incidence of
depression (Bromet et al. 2011). In contrast, low-income nations suffer significantly from malaria and
tuberculosis.
How does health differ around the world? Some theorists differentiate among three types of
countries: core nations, semi-peripheral nations, and peripheral nations. Core nations are those that we
think of as highly developed or industrialized, semi-peripheral nations are those that are often called
developing or newly industrialized, and peripheral nations are those that are relatively undeveloped.
While the most pervasive issue in the U.S. health care system is affordable access to health care, other
core countries have different issues, and semi-peripheral and peripheral nations are faced with a host of
additional concerns. Reviewing the status of global health offers insight into the various ways that
politics and wealth shape access to health care, and it shows which populations are most affected by
health disparities.

Health in High-Income Nations
Obesity, which is on the rise in high-income nations, has been linked to many diseases, including
cardiovascular problems, musculoskeletal problems, diabetes, and respiratory issues. According to the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (2011), obesity rates are rising in all
countries, with the greatest gains being made in the highest-income countries. The United States has the
highest obesity rate. Wallace Huffman and his fellow researchers (2006) contend that several factors are
contributing to the rise in obesity in developed countries:
1. Improvements in technology and reduced family size have led to a reduction of work to be done in
household production.

429

430

CHAPTER 19 | HEALTH AND MEDICINE

2. Unhealthy market goods, including processed foods, sweetened drinks, and sweet and salty snacks
are replacing home-produced goods.
3. Leisure activities are growing more sedentary, for example, computer games, web surfing, and
television viewing.
4. More workers are shifting from active work (agriculture and manufacturing) to service industries.
5. Increased access to passive transportation has led to more driving and less walking.
Obesity and weight issues have significant societal costs, including lower life expectancies and
higher shared healthcare costs.
High-income countries also have higher rates of depression than less affluent nations. A recent
study (Bromet et al. 2011) shows that the average lifetime prevalence of major depressive episodes in
the 10 highest-income countries in the study was 14.6 percent; this compared to 11.1 percent in the
eight low- and middle-income countries. The researchers speculate that the higher rate of depression
may be linked to the greater income inequality that exists in the highest-income nations.

Health in Low-Income Nations

Figure 19.4 In low-income countries, malnutrition and lack of access to clean water contribute to a high child mortality
rate. (Photo courtesy of Steve Evans/flickr)

In peripheral nations with low per capita income, it is not the cost of health care that is the most
pressing concern. Rather, low-income countries must manage such problems as infectious disease, high
infant mortality rates, scarce medical personnel, and inadequate water and sewer systems. Such issues,
which high-income countries rarely even think about, are central to the lives of most people in lowincome nations. Due to such health concerns, low-income nations have higher rates of infant mortality
and lower average life spans.
One of the biggest contributors to medical issues in low-income countries is the lack of access to
clean water and basic sanitation resources. According to a 2011 UNICEF report, almost half of the
developing world’s population lacks improved sanitation facilities. The World Health Organization
(WHO) tracks health-related data for 193 countries. In their 2011 World Health Statistics report, they
document the following statistics:
1. Globally, the rate of mortality for children under five was 60 per 1,000 live births. In low-income
countries, however, that rate is almost double at 117 per 1,000 live births. In high-income
countries, that rate is significantly lower than seven per 1,000 live births.
2. The most frequent causes of death for children under five were pneumonia and diarrheal diseases,
accounting for 18 percent and 15 percent, respectively. These deaths could be easily avoidable
with cleaner water and more coverage of available medical care.
3. The availability of doctors and nurses in low-income countries is one-tenth that of nations with a
high income. Challenges in access to medical education and access to patients exacerbate this
issue for would-be medical professionals in low-income countries (World Health Organization
2011).

19.3 Health in the United States
Health in the United States is a complex and often contradictory issue. One the one hand, as one of the
wealthiest nations, the United States fares well in health comparisons with the rest of the world.
However, the United States also lags behind almost every industrialized country in terms of providing
care to all its citizens. The following sections look at different aspects of health in America.

CHAPTER 19 | HEALTH AND MEDICINE

Health by Race and Ethnicity
When looking at the social epidemiology of the United States, it is hard to miss the disparities among
races. The discrepancy between black and white Americans shows the gap clearly; IN 2008, the average
life expectancy for white males was approximately five years longer than for black males: 75.9
compared to 70.9. An even stronger disparity was found in 2007: the infant mortality rate for blacks
was nearly twice that of whites at 13.2 compared to 5.6 per 1,000 live births (U.S. Census Bureau
2011). According to a report from the Henry J. Kaiser Foundation (2007), African Americans also have
higher incidence of several other diseases and causes of mortality, from cancer to heart disease to
diabetes. In a similar vein, it is important to note that ethnic minorities, including Mexican Americans
and Native Americans, also have higher rates of these diseases and causes of mortality than whites.
Lisa Berkman (2009) notes that this gap started to narrow during the Civil Rights movement in the
1960s, but it began widening again in the early 1980s. What accounts for these perpetual disparities in
health among different ethnic groups? Much of the answer lies in the level of health care that these
groups receive. The National Healthcare Disparities Report (2010) shows that even after adjusting for
insurance differences, racial and ethnic minority groups receive poorer quality of care and less access to
care than dominant groups. The Report identified these racial inequalities in care:
1. Black Americans, American Indians, and Alaskan Natives received inferior care than Caucasian
Americans for about 40 percent of measures
2. Asian ethnicities received inferior care for about 20 percent of measures
3. Among whites, Hispanic whites received 60 percent inferior care of measures compared to nonHispanic whites (Agency for Health Research and Quality 2010). When considering access to
care, the figures were comparable.

Health by Socioeconomic Status
Discussions of health by race and ethnicity often overlap with discussions of health by socioeconomic
status, since the two concepts are intertwined in the United States. As the Agency for Health Research
and Quality (2010) notes, “racial and ethnic minorities are more likely than non-Hispanic whites to be
poor or near poor,” so many of the data pertaining to subordinate groups is also likely to be pertinent to
low socioeconomic groups. Marilyn Winkleby and her research associates (1992) state that “one of the
strongest and most consistent predictors of a person's morbidity and mortality experience is that
person's socioeconomic status (SES). This finding persists across all diseases with few exceptions,
continues throughout the entire lifespan, and extends across numerous risk factors for disease.”
It is important to remember that economics are only part of the SES picture; research suggests that
education also plays an important role. Phelan and Link (2003) note that many behavior-influenced
diseases like lung cancer (from smoking), coronary artery disease (from poor eating and exercise
habits), and AIDS initially were widespread across SES groups. However, once information linking
habits to disease was disseminated, these diseases decreased in high SES groups and increased in low
SES groups. This illustrates the important role of education initiatives regarding a given disease, as well
as possible inequalities in how those initiatives effectively reach different SES groups.

Health by Gender
Women are affected adversely both by unequal access to and institutionalized sexism in the health care
industry. According a recent report from the Kaiser Family Foundation, women experienced a decline
in their ability to see needed specialists between 2001 and 2008. In 2008, one quarter of females
questioned the quality of her health care (Ranji and Salganico 2011). In this report, we also see the
explanatory value of intersection theory. Feminist sociologist Patricia Hill Collins developed this
theory, which suggests we cannot separate the effects of race, class, gender, sexual orientation, and
other attributes. Further examination of the lack of confidence in the health care system by women, as
identified in the Kaiser study, found, for example, women categorized as low income were more likely
(32 percent compared to 23 percent) to express concerns about health care quality, illustrating the
multiple layers of disadvantage caused by race and sex.
We can see an example of institutionalized sexism in the way that women are more likely than
men to be diagnosed with certain kinds of mental disorders. Psychologist Dana Becker notes that 75
percent of all diagnoses of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) are for women according to the
Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. This diagnosis is characterized by instability of
identity, of mood, and of behavior, and Becker argues that it has been used as a catch-all diagnosis for
too many women. She further decries the pejorative connotation of the diagnosis, saying that it
predisposes many people, both within and outside of the profession of psychotherapy, against women
who have been so diagnosed (Becker).

431

432

CHAPTER 19 | HEALTH AND MEDICINE

Many critics also point to the medicalization of women’s issues as an example of institutionalized
sexism. Medicalization refers to the process by which previously normal aspects of life are redefined
as deviant and needing medical attention to remedy. Historically and contemporaneously, many aspects
of women’s lives have been medicalized, including menstruation, pre-menstrual syndrome, pregnancy,
childbirth, and menopause. The medicalization of pregnancy and childbirth has been particularly
contentious in recent decades, with many women opting against the medical process and choosing a
more natural childbirth. Fox and Worts (1999) find that all women experience pain and anxiety during
the birth process, but that social support relieves both as effectively as medical support. In other words,
medical interventions are no more effective than social ones at helping with the difficulties of pain and
childbirth. Fox and Worts further found that women with supportive partners ended up with less
medical intervention and fewer cases of postpartum depression. Of course, access to quality birth care
outside of the standard medical models may not be readily available to women of all social classes.

Medicalization of Sleeplessness

Figure 19.5 Many people fail to get enough sleep. But is insomnia a disease that should be cured with medication?
(Photo courtesy of Wikimedia Commons)

How is your “sleep hygiene?” Sleep hygiene refers to the lifestyle and sleep habits that contribute
to sleeplessness. Bad habits that can lead to sleeplessness include inconsistent bedtimes, lack of
exercise, late-night employment, napping during the day, and sleep environments that include
noise, lights, or screen time (National Institutes of Health 2011a).
According to the National Institute of Health, examining sleep hygiene is the first step in
trying to solve a problem with sleeplessness.
For many Americans, however, making changes in sleep hygiene does not seem to be enough.
According to a 2006 report from the Institute of Medicine, sleeplessness is an underrecognized
public health problem affecting up to 70 million people. It is interesting to note that in the months
(or years) after this report was released, advertising by the pharmaceutical companies behind
Ambien, Lunesta, and Sepracor (three sleep aids) averaged $188 million weekly promoting these
drugs (Gellene 2009).
According to a study in the American Journal of Public Health (2011), prescriptions for sleep
medications increased dramatically from 1993 to 2007. While complaints of sleeplessness during
doctor’s office visits more than doubled during this time, insomnia diagnoses increased more than
sevenfold, from about 840,000 to 6.1 million. The authors of the study conclude that sleeplessness
has been medicalized as insomnia, and that “insomnia may be a public health concern, but
potential overtreatment with marginally effective, expensive medications with nontrivial side
effects raises definite population health concerns” (Moloney, Konrad, and Zimmer 2011). Indeed,
a study published in 2004 in the Archives of Internal Medicine shows that cognitive behavioral
therapy, not medication, was the most effective sleep intervention (Jacobs, Pace-Schott, Stickgold,
and Otto 2004).
A century ago, people who couldn’t sleep were told to count sheep. Now, they pop a pill, and
all those pills add up to a very lucrative market for the pharmaceutical industry. Is this industry
behind the medicalization of sleeplessness, or are they just responding to a need?

CHAPTER 19 | HEALTH AND MEDICINE

Mental Health and Disability
The treatment received by those defined as mentally ill or disabled varies greatly from country to
country. In post-millennial America, those of us who have never experienced such a disadvantage take
for granted the rights our society guarantees for each citizen. We do not think about the relatively recent
nature of the protections, unless, of course, we know someone constantly inconvenienced by the lack of
accommodations or misfortune of suddenly experiencing a temporary disability.
Mental Health
People with mental disorders (a condition that makes it more difficult to cope with everyday life) and
people with mental illness (a severe, lasting mental disorder that requires long term treatment)
experience a wide range of effects.
According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), the most common mental disorders
in the United States are anxiety disorders. Almost 18 percent of American adults are likely to be
affected in a single year, and 28 percent are likely to be affected over the course of a lifetime (National
Institute of Mental Health 2005). It is important to distinguish between occasional feelings of anxiety
and a true anxiety disorder. Anxiety is a normal reaction to stress that we all feel at some point, but
anxiety disorders are feelings of worry and fearfulness that last for months at a time. Anxiety disorders
include obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD),
and both social and specific phobias.
The second most common mental disorders in the United States are mood disorders; roughly 10
percent of American adults are likely to be affected yearly, while 21 percent are likely to be affected
over the course of a lifetime (National Institute of Mental Health 2005). Major mood disorders are
depression, bipolar disorder, and dysthymic disorder. Like anxiety, depression might seem like
something that everyone experiences at some point, and it is true that most people feel sad or “blue” at
times in their lives. A true depressive episode, however, is more than just feeling sad for a short period.
It is a long-term, debilitating illness that usually needs treatment to cure. And bipolar disorder is
characterized by dramatic shifts in energy and mood, often affecting the individual’s ability to carry out
day-to-day tasks. Bipolar disorder used to be called manic depression because of the way that people
would swing between manic and depressive episodes.
Depending on what definition is used, there is some overlap between mood disorders and
personality disorders, which affect nine percent of Americans yearly. The American Psychological
Association publishes the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual on Mental Disorders (DSM), and their
definition of personality disorders is changing in the fifth edition, which is being revised in 2011 and
2012. In the DSM-IV, personality disorders represent “an enduring pattern of inner experience and
behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of the culture of the individual who exhibits it”
(National Institute of Mental Health). In other words, personality disorders cause people to behave in
ways that are seen as abnormal to society but seem normal to them. The DSM-V proposes broadening
this definition by offering five broad personality trait domains to describe personality disorders, some
related to the level or type of their disconnect with society. As their application evolves, we will see
how their definitions help scholars across disciplines understand the intersection of health issues and
how they are defined by social institutions and cultural norms.

Figure 19.6 Medication is a common option for children with ADHD. (Photo courtesy of Deviation56/Wikimedia Commons)
Another fairly commonly diagnosed mental disorder is Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder
(ADHD), which statistics suggest affects nine percent of children and eight percent of adults on a
lifetime basis (National Institute of Mental Health 2005). ADHD is one of the most common childhood
disorders, and it is marked by difficulty paying attention, difficulty controlling behavior, and

433

434

CHAPTER 19 | HEALTH AND MEDICINE

hyperactivity. According to the American Psychological Association (APA), ADHD responds positively
to stimulant drugs like Ritalin, which helps people stay focused. However, there is some social debate
over whether such drugs are being overprescribed (American Psychological Association). In fact, some
critics question whether this disorder is really as widespread as it seems, or if it is a case of
overdiagnosis.
Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) have gained a lot of attention in recent years. The term ASD
encompasses a group of developmental brain disorders that are characterized by “deficits in social
interaction, verbal and nonverbal communication, and engagement in repetitive behaviors or interests”
(National Institute of Mental Health). As with the personality disorders described above, the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual on Mental Disorders’ description of these is in the process of being revised.
The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) distinguishes between serious mental illness and
other disorders. The key feature of serious mental illness is that it results in “serious functional
impairment, which substantially interferes with or limits one or more major life activities” (National
Institute of Mental Health). Thus, the characterization of “serious” refers to the effect of the illness
(functional impairment), not the illness itself.
Although the view is not widely held, there are some researchers who argue that mental illness is a
myth. For example, to Thomas Scheff (1963), residual deviance—a violation of social norms not
covered by any specific behavioral expectation—is what actually results in people being labeled
mentally ill. In The Myth of Mental Illness: Foundations of a Theory of Personal Conduct (1961),
Thomas Szasz asks if there is such a thing as mental illness, and then argues that there is not. Rather,
mental illness is a deviation from what others view as normal, with no basis in biological disease. Szasz
calls for greater personal responsibility and less reliance on institutions.
Disability

Figure 19.7 The handicapped accessible sign indicates that people with disabilities can access the facility. The Americans
with Disabilities Act requires that access be provided to everyone. (Photo courtesy of Ltljltlj/Wikimedia Commons)

Disability refers to a reduction in one’s ability to perform everyday tasks. The World Health
Organization makes a distinction between the various terms used to describe handicaps that’s important
to the sociological perspective. They use the term impairment to describe the physical limitations,
while reserving the term disability to refer to the social limitation.
Before the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) in 1990, Americans with
disabilities were often excluded from opportunities and social institutions many of us take for granted.
This occurred not only through employment and other kinds of discrimination, but through casual
acceptance by most Americans of a world designed for the convenience of the able-bodied. Imagine
being in a wheelchair and trying to use a sidewalk without the benefit of wheelchair accessible curbs.
Imagine as a blind person trying to access information without the widespread availability of Braille.
Imagine having limited motor control and being faced with a difficult-to-grasp round door handle.
Issues like these are what the ADA tries to address. Ramps on sidewalks, Braille instructions, and more
accessible door levers are all accommodations to help people with disabilities.
People with disabilities can be stigmatized by their illness. Stigmatization means that their
identity is spoiled; they are labeled as different, discriminated against, and sometimes even shunned.
They are labeled (as an interactionist might point out) and ascribed a master status (as a functionalist
might note), becoming “the blind girl” or “the boy in the wheelchair” instead of someone afforded a full
identity by society. This can be especially true for people who are disabled due to mental illness or
disorders.
As discussed in the section on mental health, many mental health disorders can be debilitating,
affecting a person’s ability to cope with everyday life. This can affect social status, housing, and
especially employment. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (2011), people with a disability had
a higher rate of unemployment thaN people without a disability in 2010: 14.8 percent to 9.4 percent.
This unemployment rate refers only to people actively looking for a job. In fact, eight out of 10 people

CHAPTER 19 | HEALTH AND MEDICINE

with a disability are considered “out of the labor force;” that is, they do not have jobs and are not
looking for them. The combination of this population and the high unemployment rate leads to an
employment-population ratio of 18.6 percent among those with disabilities. The employmentpopulation ratio for people without disabilities was much higher, at 63.5 percent (U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics 2011).

Obesity: The Last Acceptable Prejudice

Figure 19.8 Obesity is considered the last acceptable social stigma. (Photo courtesy of Kyle May/flickr)
What is your reaction to the picture above? Compassion? Fear? Disgust? Many people will look at
this picture and make negative assumptions about the man based on his weight. According to a
study from the Yale Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity, large people are the object of
“widespread negative stereotypes that overweight and obese persons are lazy, unmotivated, lacking
in self-discipline, less competent, noncompliant, and sloppy” (Puhl and Heuer 2009).
Historically, both in the United States and elsewhere, it was considered acceptable to
discriminate against people based on prejudiced opinions. Even after slavery was abolished in
1865, the next 100 years of American history saw institutionalized racism and prejudice against
black people. In an example of stereotype interchangeability, the same insults that are flung
today at the overweight and obese population (lazy, for instance), have been flung at various racial
and ethnic groups in earlier history. Of course, no one gives voice to these kinds of views in public
now, except when talking about obese people.
Why is it considered acceptable to feel prejudice toward—even to hate—obese people? Puhl
and Heuer suggest that these feelings stem from the perception that obesity is preventable through
self-control, better diet, and more exercise. Highlighting this contention is the fact that studies
have shown that people’s perceptions of obesity are more positive when they think the obesity was
caused by non-controllable factors like biology (a thyroid condition, for instance) or genetics.
Even with some understanding of non-controllable factors that might affect obesity, obese
people are still subject to stigmatization. Puhl and Heuer’s study is one of many that document
discrimination at work, in the media, and even in the medical profession. Obese people are less
likely to get into college than thinner people, and they are less likely to succeed at work.
Stigmatization of obese people comes in many forms, from the seemingly benign to the
potentially illegal. In movies and television show, overweight people are often portrayed
negatively, or as stock characters who are the butt of jokes. One study found that in children’s
movies “obesity was equated with negative traits (evil, unattractive, unfriendly, cruel) in 64
percent of the most popular children's videos. In 72 percent of the videos, characters with thin
bodies had desirable traits, such as kindness or happiness” (Hines and Thompson 2007). In movies
and television for adults, the negative portrayal is often meant to be funny. “Fat suits”—inflatable
suits that make people look obese—are commonly used in a way that perpetuates negative
stereotypes. Think about the way you have seen obese people portrayed in movies and on
television; now think of any other subordinate group being openly denigrated in such a way. It is
difficult to find a parallel example.

CHAPTER 19 | HEALTH AND MEDICINE

19.4 Comparative Health and Medicine
There are broad, structural differences among the health care systems of different countries. In core
nations, those differences might arise in the administration of health care, while the care itself is similar.
In peripheral and semi-peripheral countries, a lack of basic health care administration can be the
defining feature of the system. Most countries rely on some combination of modern and traditional
medicine. In core countries with large investments in technology, research, and equipment, the focus is
usually on modern medicine, with traditional (also called alternative or complementary) medicine
playing a secondary role. In the United States, for instance, the American Medical Association (AMA)
resolved to support the incorporation of complementary and alternative medicine in medical education.
In developing countries, even quickly modernizing ones like China, traditional medicine (often
understood as “complementary” by the western world) may still play a larger role.

American Health Care
United States health care coverage can broadly be divided into two main categories: public health care
(government-funded) and private health care (privately funded).
The two main publicly funded health care programs are Medicare, which provides health services
to people over 65 years old as well as people who meet other standards for disability, and Medicaid,
which provides services to people with very low incomes who meet other eligibility requirements.
Other government-funded programs include service agencies focused on Native Americans (the Indian
Health Service), Veterans (the Veterans Health Administration), and children (the Children’s Health
Insurance Program). A controversial issue in 2011 was a proposed constitutional amendment requiring
a balanced federal budget, which would almost certainly require billions of dollars in cuts to these
programs. As discussed below, the United States already has a significant problem with lack of health
care coverage for many individuals; if these budget cuts pass, the already heavily burdened programs
are sure to suffer, and so are the people they serve (Kogan 2011).
The U.S. Census (2011) divides private insurance into employment-based insurance and directpurchase insurance. Employment-based insurance is health plan coverage that is provided in whole or
in part by an employer or union; it can cover just the employee, or the employee and his or her family.
Direct purchase insurance is coverage that an individual buys directly from a private company.
With all these insurance options, insurance coverage must be almost universal, right?
Unfortunately, the U.S. Census Current Population Survey of 2010 and 2011 shows that 16 percent of
Americans have no health insurance at all. Equally alarming, a study by the Commonwealth Fund
shows that in 2010, 81 million adults were either uninsured or underinsured; that is, people who pay at
least ten percent of their income on health care costs not covered by insurance or, for low-income
adults, those whose medical expenses or deductibles are at least five percent of their income (Schoen,
Doty, Robertson, and Collins 2011). The Commonwealth study further reports that while
underinsurance has historically been an issue that low-income families faced, today it is affecting
middle-income families more and more.
Why are so many people uninsured or underinsured? Skyrocketing health care costs are part of the
issue. Many people cannot afford private health insurance, but their income level is not low enough to
meet eligibility standards for government supported insurance. Further, even for those who are eligible
for Medicaid, the program is less than perfect. Many physicians refuse to accept Medicaid patients,
citing low payments and extensive paperwork (Washington University Center for Health Policy N.d.).
Health care in the United States is a complex issue, and it will only get more so with the continued
enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) of 2010. This Act, sometimes
called “ObamaCare” for its most noted advocate, President Barack Obama, represents large-scale
federal reform of the United States’ health care system. Most of the provisions of the Act will take
effect by 2014, but some were effective immediately on passage. The PPACA aims to address some of
the biggest flaws of the current health care system. It expands eligibility to programs like Medicaid and
CHIP, helps guarantee insurance coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, and establishes
regulations to make sure that the premium funds collected by insurers and care providers go directly to
medical care. It also includes an individual mandate, which requires everyone to have insurance
coverage by 2014 or pay a penalty. A series of provisions, including significant subsidies, are intended
to address the discrepancies in income that are currently contributing to high rates of uninsurance and
underinsurance.

CHAPTER 19 | HEALTH AND MEDICINE

Figure 19.9 Many Americans worry that governmental oversight of health care represents a federal overstepping of
constitutional guarantees of individual freedom. Others welcome a program that they believe will make health care accessible
and affordable to everyone. (Photo courtesy of Fibonacci Blue/flickr)

The PPACA has been incredibly contentious. Private insurance companies have been among the
strongest opponents of the law. But many Americans are also concerned that the PPACA will actually
result in their medical bills increasing. In particular, some people oppose the individual mandate on the
grounds that the federal government should not require them to have health care. A coalition of 26
states and the National Federation of Independent Businesses brought suit against the federal
government, citing a violation of state sovereignty and concerns about costs of administering the
program.

Health Care Elsewhere
Clearly, health care in the United States has some areas for improvement. But how does it compare to
health care in other countries? Many Americans are fond of saying that this country has the best health
care in the world, and while it is true that the United States has a higher quality of care available than
many peripheral or semi-peripheral nations, it is not necessarily the “best in the world.” In a report on
how American health care compares to that of other countries, researchers found that the United States
does “relatively well in some areas—such as cancer care—and less well in others—such as mortality
from conditions amenable to prevention and treatment” (Docteur and Berenson 2009).
One critique of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is that it will create a system of
socialized medicine, a term that for many Americans has negative connotations lingering from the Cold
War era and earlier. Under a socialized medicine system, the government owns and runs the system. It
employs the doctors, nurses, and other staff, and it owns and runs the hospitals (Klein 2009). The best
example of socialized medicine is in Great Britain, where the National Health System (NHS) gives free
health care to all its residents. And despite some Americans’ knee-jerk reaction to any health care
changes that hint of socialism, the United States has one socialized system with the Veterans Health
Administration.
It is important to distinguish between socialized medicine, in which the government owns the
health care system, and universal health care, which is simply a system that guarantees health care
coverage for everyone. Germany, Singapore, and Canada all have universal health care. People often
look to Canada’s universal health care system, Medicare, as a model for the system. In Canada, health
care is publicly funded and is administered by the separate provincial and territorial governments.
However, the care itself comes from private providers. This is the main difference between universal
health care and socialized medicine. The Canada Health Act of 1970 required that all health insurance
plans must be “available to all eligible Canadian residents, comprehensive in coverage, accessible,
portable among provinces, and publicly administered” (International Health Systems Canada 2010).
Heated discussions about socialization of medicine and managed care options seem frivolous when
compared with the issues of health care systems in developing or underdeveloped countries. In many
countries, per capita income is so low, and governments are so fractured, that health care as we know it
is virtually non-existent. Care that people in developed countries take for granted—like hospitals, health
care workers, immunizations, antibiotics and other medications, and even sanitary water for drinking
and washing—are unavailable to much of the population. Organizations like Doctors Without Borders,
UNICEF, and the World Health Organization have played an important role in helping these countries
get their most basic health needs met.

CHAPTER 19 | HEALTH AND MEDICINE

Figure 19.10 This map shows the countries where malaria is known to occur. In low-income countries, malaria is still a
common cause of death. (Photo courtesy of the CDC/Wikimedia Commons)

WHO, which is the health arm of the United Nations, set eight Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs) in 2000 with the aim of reaching these goals by 2015. Some of the goals deal more broadly
with the socioeconomic factors that influence health, but MDGs 4, 5, and 6 all relate specifically to
large-scale health concerns, the likes of which most Americans will never contemplate. MDG 4 is to
reduce child mortality, MDG 5 aims to improve maternal health, and MDG 6 strives to combat HIV/
AIDS, malaria, and other diseases. The goals may not seem particularly dramatic, but the numbers
behind them show how serious they are.
For MDG 4, the WHO reports that 2009 infant mortality rates in “children under 5 years old in the
WHO African Region (127 per 1000 live births) and in low-income countries (117 per 1000 live births)
[had dropped], but they were still higher than the 1990 global level of 89 per 1000 live births” (World
Health Organization 2011). The fact that these deaths could have been avoided through appropriate
medicine and clean drinking water shows the importance of health care.
Much progress has been made on MDG 5, with maternal deaths decreasing by 34 percent.
However, almost all maternal deaths occurred in developing countries, with the African region still
experiencing high numbers (World Health Organization 2011).
On MDG 6, the WHO is seeing some decreases in per capita incidence rates of malaria,
tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and other diseases. However, the decreases are often offset by population
increases (World Health Organization 2011). Again, the lowest-income countries, especially in the
African region, experience the worst problems with disease.

19.5 Theoretical Perspectives on Health and
Medicine
Each of the three major theoretical perspectives approaches the topics of health, illness, and medicine
differently. You may prefer just one of the theories that follow, or you may find that combining theories
and perspectives provides a fuller picture of how we experience health and wellness.

Functionalism
According to the functionalist perspective, health is vital to the stability of the society, and therefore
sickness is a sanctioned form of deviance. Talcott Parsons (1951) was the first to discuss this in terms of
the sick role: patterns of expectations that define appropriate behavior for the sick and for those who
take care of them.
According to Parsons, the sick person has a specific role with both rights and responsibilities. To
start with, she has not chosen to be sick and should not be treated as responsible for her condition. The
sick person also has the right of being exempt from normal social roles; she is not required to fulfill the
obligation of a well person and can avoid her normal responsibilities without censure. However, this
exemption is temporary and relative to the severity of the illness. The exemption also requires
legitimation by a physician; that is, a physician must certify that the illness is genuine.
The responsibility of the sick person is twofold: to try to get well and to seek technically
competent help from a physician. If the sick person stays ill longer than is appropriate (malingers), she
may be stigmatized.

CHAPTER 19 | HEALTH AND MEDICINE

Parsons argues that since the sick are unable to fulfill their normal societal roles, their sickness
weakens the society. Therefore, it is sometimes necessary for various forms of social control to bring
the behavior of a sick person back in line with normal expectations. In this model of health, doctors
serve as gatekeepers, deciding who is healthy and who is sick—a relationship in which the doctor has
all the power. But is it appropriate to allow doctors so much power over deciding who is sick? And
what about people who are sick, but are unwilling to leave their positions for any number of reasons
(personal/social obligations, financial need, or lack of insurance, for instance).

Conflict Perspective
Theorists using the conflict perspective suggest that issues with the healthcare system, as with most
other social problems, are rooted in capitalist society. According to conflict theorists, capitalism and the
pursuit of profit lead to the commodification of health: the changing of something not generally
thought of as a commodity into something that can be bought and sold in a marketplace. In this view,
people with money and power—the dominant group—are the ones who make decisions about how the
health care system will be run. They therefore ensure that they will have health care coverage, while
simultaneously ensuring that subordinate groups stay subordinate through lack of access. This creates
significant health care—and health—disparities between the dominant and subordinate groups.
Alongside the health disparities created by class inequalities, there are a number of health
disparities created by racism, sexism, ageism, and heterosexism. When health is a commodity, the poor
are more likely to experience illness caused by poor diet, to live and work in unhealthy environments,
and are less likely to challenge the system. In the United States, a disproportionate number of racial
minorities also have less economic power, so they bear a great deal of the burden of poor health. It is
not only the poor who suffer from the conflict between dominant and subordinate groups. For many
years now, homosexual couples have been denied spousal benefits, either in the form of health
insurance or in terms of medical responsibility. Further adding to the issue, doctors hold a
disproportionate amount of power in the doctor/patient relationship, which provides them with
extensive social and economic benefits.
While conflict theorists are accurate in pointing out certain inequalities in the health care system,
they do not give enough credit to medical advances that would not have been made without an
economic structure to support and reward researchers: a structure dependent on profitability.
Additionally, in their criticism of the power differential between doctor and patient, they are perhaps
dismissive of the hard-won medical expertise possessed by doctors and not patients, which renders a
truly egalitarian relationship more elusive.

Symbolic Interactionism
According to theorists working in this perspective, health and illness are both socially constructed. As
we discussed in the beginning of the chapter, interactionists focus on the specific meanings and causes
people attribute to illness. The term medicalization of deviance refers to the process that changes
“bad” behavior into “sick” behavior. A related process is demedicalization, in which “sick” behavior is
normalized again. Medicalization and demedicalization affect who responds to the patient, how people
respond to the patient, and how people view the personal responsibility of the patient (Conrad and
Schneider 1992).

CHAPTER 19 | HEALTH AND MEDICINE

Figure 19.11 In this engraving from the 19th century, “King Alcohol” is shown with a skeleton on a barrel of alcohol. The
words “poverty,” “misery,” “crime,” and “death” hang in the air behind him. (Photo courtesy of the Library of Congress/Wikimedia
Commons)

An example of medicalization is illustrated by the history of how our society views alcohol and
alcoholism. During the 19th century, people who drank too much were considered bad, lazy people.
They were called drunks, and it was not uncommon for them to be arrested or run out of a town. Drunks
were not treated in a sympathetic way because, at that time, it was thought that it was their own fault
that they could not stop drinking. During the latter half of the 20th century, however, people who drank
too much were increasingly defined as alcoholics: people with a disease or a genetic predisposition to
addiction who were not responsible for their drinking. With alcoholism defined as a disease and not a
personal choice, alcoholics came to be viewed with more compassion and understanding. Thus,
“badness” was transformed into “sickness.”
There are numerous examples of demedicalization in history as well. During the Civil War era,
slaves who frequently ran away from their owners were diagnosed with a mental disorder called
drapetomania. This has since been reinterpreted as a completely appropriate response to being
enslaved. A more recent example is homosexuality, which was labeled a mental disorder or a sexual
orientation disturbance by the American Psychological Association until 1973.
While interactionism does acknowledge the subjective nature of diagnosis, it is important to
remember who most benefits when a behavior becomes defined as illness. Pharmaceutical companies
make billions treating illnesses such as fatigue, insomnia, and hyperactivity that may not actually be
illnesses in need of treatment, but opportunities for companies to make more money.

Section Summary
19.1 The Social Construction of Health
Medical sociology is the systematic study of how humans manage issues of health and illness, disease
and disorders, and health care for both the sick and the healthy. The social construction of health
explains how society shapes and is shaped by medical ideas.

19.2 Global Health
Social epidemiology is the study of the causes and distribution of diseases. From a global perspective,
the health issues of high-income nations tend toward diseases like cancer as well as those that are linked
to obesity, like heart disease, diabetes, and musculoskeletal disorders. Low-income nations are more
likely to contend with infectious disease, high infant mortality rates, scarce medical personnel, and
inadequate water and sanitation systems.

19.3 Health in the United States
Despite generally good health in the U.S. compared with less-developed countries, America is still
facing challenging issues such as a prevalence of obesity and diabetes. Moreover, Americans of
historically disadvantaged racial groups, ethnicities, socioeconomic status, and gender experience lower
levels of health care. Mental health and disability are health issues that are significantly impacted by
social norms.

19.4 Comparative Health and Medicine

442

CHAPTER 19 | HEALTH AND MEDICINE

There are broad, structural differences among the health care systems of different countries. In core
nations, those differences include publicly funded health care, privately funded health care, and
combinations of both. In peripheral and semi-peripheral countries, a lack of basic health care
administration can be the defining feature of the system.

19.5 Theoretical Perspectives on Health and Medicine
While the functionalist perspective looks at how health and illness fit into a fully functioning society,
the conflict perspective is concerned with how health and illness fit into the oppositional forces in
society. The interactionist perspective is concerned with how social interactions construct ideas of
health and illness.

Introduction to Population, Urbanization, and the
Environment
There used to be a place called Centralia, Pennsylvania. Some current maps might still show the town,
which was on Route 61 in the heart of Pennsylvania’s coal region. But many others have removed the
defunct town from atlases, despite the fact that there are still a few die-hard residents there. The town
incorporated in the 1860s and once had several thousand residents, largely coal workers. But the story
of its demise begins a century later, in 1962. That year, a trash-burning fire was lit in the pit of the old
abandoned coalmine outside of town. The fire moved down the mineshaft and ignited a vein of coal.
That fire is still burning.
Of course, some initial efforts were made to put out the fire, both above ground and below. But it
continued to burn a few days later. It was put out again, and again it flared up. This is when it traveled
down the vein and ignited the coal deposit beneath the ground. For more than 20 years, people tried to
extinguish the underground fire, but no matter what they did, it returned. There was little government
action, and people had to abandon their homes as toxic gases engulfed the area and sinkholes
developed. The situation drew national attention when the ground collapsed under 12-year-old Todd
Domboski in 1981. He was in his yard when a sinkhole four feet wide and 150 feet deep opened up
beneath him. He clung to exposed tree roots and saved his life; if he had fallen a few feet farther, the
heat or carbon monoxide would have killed him instantly.
In 1983, engineers studying the fire concluded that it could burn for another century or more, and
could spread over nearly 4,000 acres. At this point, the government offered to “buy out” existing
residents, relocating them to nearby towns. A few determined Centralians refused, and they are the only
ones who remain. In one field, signs warn people to enter at their own risk, as the ground is hot and
unstable.
As we examine population, urbanization, and the environment, we will see how these subjects
relate to Centralia. Environmental disaster. Abandoned ghost town. A population forced from their
homes. Today, the few stalwart residents refuse to leave, but the government owns their homes. And the
fire burns on (DeKok 1986).

CHAPTER 20 | POPULATION, URBANIZATION, AND THE ENVIRONMENT

Many of you have seen the 2000 movie, Erin Brokovich, about a legal assistant who spearheads a
$300 million lawsuit against a California power company. The story is true, and the town of Hinkley,
California, is an example of a cancer cluster, a geographic area with proportionately higher cancer
rates (in the Erin Brokovich case caused by a toxin leaked into the groundwater) . It can be very
challenging to go up against major governmental or corporate interests, and the Hinkley case is an
inspiring example of success; however, the damage wrought on that area’s population cannot be
undone.
As the stories of Centralia and Hinkley illustrate, there are important societal issues connected to
the environment and how and where people live. Sociologists begin to examine these issues through
demography, or the study of population, and how it relates to urbanization, the study of the social,
political, and economic relationships in cities. Environmental sociologists look at the study of how
humans interact with their environments. Today, as has been the case many times in history, we are at a
point of conflict in a number of these areas. The world’s population has recently reached seven million.
When will it reach eight million? Can our planet sustain such a population? We generate more trash
than ever, from Starbucks cups to obsolete cell phones with toxic chemicals to food waste that could be
composted. Where it is all going? Chances are that you are likely unaware of where your trash ends up.
And while this problem exists worldwide, trash issues are often more acute in urban areas. Cities and
city living create new challenges for both society and the environment. These kinds of interactions
between people and places are of critical importance.
How do sociologists study these issues? A functionalist sociologist might focus on the way that all
aspects of population, urbanization, and the environment serve as vital and cohesive elements, ensuring
the continuing stability of society. A functionalist might study how the growth of the global population
encourages emigration and immigration, and how emigration and immigration serve to strengthen ties
between nations. Or she might research how migration impacts environmental issues; for example, how
have forced migrations, and the resulting changes in a region’s ability to support a new people group,
affected both the displaced people and the area of relocation? Another topic a functionalist might
research is the way that various urban neighborhoods specialize to serve cultural and financial needs.
A conflict theorist, interested in the creation and reproduction of inequality, might ask how
peripheral nations’ lack of family planning impacts the overall population in comparison to core nations
that tend to have lower fertility rates? Or, how do inner cities become ghettos, nearly devoid of jobs,
education, and other opportunities? A conflict theorist might also study environmental racism and other
forms of environmental inequality. For example, looking at Hurricane Katrina, which parts of New
Orleans’ society were the most responsive to the evacuation order? Which area was most affected by
the flooding? And where (and in what conditions) were people living in those areas housed, both during
and before the evacuation?
A symbolic interactionist interested in the day-to-day interaction of groups and individuals might
research topics like how family-planning information is presented to and understood by different
population groups, how people experience and understand urban life, and what language people use to
convince others of the presence (or absence) of global climate change. For example, some politicians
wish to present the study of global warming as junk science, and other politicians insist it is a proven
fact.

CHAPTER 20 | POPULATION, URBANIZATION, AND THE ENVIRONMENT

We recently hit a population milestone of seven billion humans on the earth’s surface. The rapidity with
which this happened demonstrated an exponential increase from the time it took to grow from five
billion to six billion people. In short, the planet is filling up. How quickly will we go from seven billion
to eight billion? How will that population be distributed? Where is population the highest? Where is it
slowing down? Where will people live? To explore these questions, we turn to demography, or the
study of populations. Three of the most important components affecting the issues above are fertility,
mortality, and migration.
The fertility rate of a society is a measure noting the number of children born. The fertility
number is generally lower than the fecundity number, which measures the potential number of children
that could be born to women of childbearing age. Sociologists measure fertility using the crude birthrate
(the number of live births per 1,000 people per year). Just as fertility measures childbearing, the
mortality rate is a measure of the number of people who die. The crude death rate is a number derived
from the number of deaths per 1,000 people per year. When analyzed together, fertility and mortality
rates help researchers understand the overall growth occurring in a population.
Another key element in studying populations is the movement of people into and out of an area.
Migration may take the form of immigration, which describes movement into an area to take up
permanent residence, or emigration, which refers to movement out of an area to another place of
permanent residence. Migration might be voluntary (as when college students study abroad),
involuntary (as when Somalians left the drought and famine-stricken portion of their nation to stay in
refugee camps), or forced (as when many Native American tribes were removed from the lands they’d
lived in for generations).

Population Growth
Changing fertility, mortality, and migration rates make up the total population composition, a snapshot
of the demographic profile of a population. This number can be measured for societies, nations, world
regions, or other groups. The population composition includes the sex ratio (the number of men for
every hundred women) as well as the population pyramid (a picture of population distribution by sex
and age).

Figure 20.4 This population pyramid shows the breakdown of the 2010 American population according to age and sex.

Table 20.1 Varying Fertility and Mortality Rated by Country As the table above illustrates,
countries vary greatly in fertility rates and mortality rates—the components that make up a
population composition. (Chart courtesy of CIA World Factbook 2011)

Comparing these three countries reveals that there are more men than women in Afghanistan, whereas
the reverse is true in Sweden and the United States. Afghanistan also has significantly higher fertility
and mortality rates than either of the other two countries. Do these statistics surprise you? How do you
think the population makeup impacts the political climate and economics of the different countries?

CHAPTER 20 | POPULATION, URBANIZATION, AND THE ENVIRONMENT

Demographic Theories
Sociologists have long looked at population issues as central to understanding human interactions.
Below we will look at four theories about population that inform sociological thought: Malthusian, zero
population growth, cornucopian, and demographic transition theories.
Malthusian Theory
Thomas Malthus (1766–1834) was an English clergyman who made dire predictions about earth’s
ability to sustain its growing population. According to Malthusian theory, three factors would control
human population that exceeded the earth’s carrying capacity, or how many people can live in a given
area considering the amount of available resources. He identified these factors as war, famine, and
disease (Malthus 1798). He termed these “positive checks” because they increased mortality rates, thus
keeping the population in check, so to speak. These are countered by “preventative checks,” which also
seek to control the population, but by reducing fertility rates; preventive checks include birth control
and celibacy. Thinking practically, Malthus saw that people could only produce so much food in a given
year, yet the population was increasing at an exponential rate. Eventually, he thought people would run
out of food and begin to starve. They would go to war over the increasingly scarce resources, reduce the
population to a manageable level, and the cycle would begin anew.
Of course, this has not exactly happened. The human population has continued to grow long past
Malthus’s predictions. So what happened? Why didn’t we die off? There are three reasons that
sociologists suggest we continue to expand the population of our planet. First, technological increases
in food production have increased both the amount and quality of calories we can produce per person.
Second, human ingenuity has developed new medicine to curtail death through disease. Finally, the
development and widespread use of contraception and other forms of family planning have decreased
the speed at which our population increases. But what about the future? Some still believe that Malthus
was correct and that ample resources to support the earth’s population will soon run out.
Zero Population Growth
A neo-Malthusian researcher named Paul Ehrlich brought Malthus’s predictions into the 20th century.
However, according to Ehrlich, it is the environment, not specifically the food supply, that will play a
crucial role in the continued health of planet’s population (Ehrlich 1968). His ideas suggest that the
human population is moving rapidly toward complete environmental collapse, as privileged people use
up or pollute a number of environmental resources, such as water and air. He advocated for a goal of
zero population growth (ZPG), in which the number of people entering a population through birth or
immigration is equal to the number of people leaving it via death or emigration. While support for this
concept is mixed, it is still considered a possible solution to global overpopulation.
Cornucopian Theory
Of course, some theories are less focused on the pessimistic hypothesis that the world’s population will
meet a detrimental challenge to sustaining itself. Cornucopian theory scoffs at the idea of humans
wiping themselves out; it asserts that human ingenuity can resolve any environmental or social issues
that develop. As an example, it points to the issue of food supply. If we need more food, the theory
contends, agricultural scientists will figure out how to grow it, as they have already been doing for
centuries. After all, in this perspective, human ingenuity has been up to the task for thousands of years
and there is no reason for that pattern not to continue (Simon 1981).
Demographic Transition Theory
Whether you believe that we are headed for environmental disaster and the end of human existence as
we know it, or you think people will always adapt to changing circumstances, there are clear patterns
that can be seen in population growth. Societies develop along a predictable continuum as they evolve
from unindustrialized to postindustrial. Demographic transition theory (Caldwell and Caldwell 2006)
suggests that future population growth will develop along a predictable four-stage model.
In Stage 1, birth, death, and infant mortality rates are all high, while life expectancy is short. An
example of this stage is 1800s America. As countries begin to industrialize, they enter Stage 2, where
birthrates are higher while infant mortality and the death rates drop. Life expectancy also increases.
Afghanistan is currently in this stage. Stage 3 occurs once a society is thoroughly industrialized;
birthrates decline, while life expectancy continues to increase. Death rates continue to decrease.
Mexico’s population is at this stage. In the final phase, Stage 4, we see the postindustrial era of a
society. Birth and death rates are low, people are healthier and live longer, and society enters a phase of
population stability. Overall population may even decline. Sweden and the United States are considered
Stage 4.

CHAPTER 20 | POPULATION, URBANIZATION, AND THE ENVIRONMENT

Current Population Trends
As mentioned earlier, the earth’s population is seven billion. That number might not seem particularly
jarring on its own; after all, we all know there are lots of people around. But consider the fact that
human population grew very slowly for most of our existence, then doubled in the span of half a
century to reach six billion in 1999. And now, just over ten years later, we have added another billion.
A look at the graph of projected population indicates that growth is not only going to continue, but it
will continue at a rapid rate.
The United Nations Population Fund (2008) categorizes nations as high fertility, intermediate
fertility, or low fertility. They anticipate the population growth to triple between 2011 and 2100 in highfertility countries, which are currently concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa. For countries with
intermediate fertility rates (the U.S., India, and Mexico all fall into this category), growth is expected to
be about 26 percent. And low-fertility countries like China, Australia, and most of Europe will actually
see population declines of approximately 20 percent. The graphs below illustrate this trend.

Figure 20.5 Projected Population in Africa This graph shows the population growth of countries located
on the African continent, many of which have high fertility rates. (Graph courtesy of USAID)

Figure 20.6 Projected Population in the United States The United States has an intermediate
fertility rate, and therefore, a comparatively moderate projected population growth. (Graph courtesy of USAID)

Figure 20.7 Projected Population in Europe This chart shows the projected population growth of Europe
for the remainder of this century. (Graph courtesy of USAID)

It would be impossible to discuss population growth and trends without addressing access to
family planning resources and birth control. As the stages of population growth indicate, more
industrialized countries see birthrates decline as families limit the number of children they have. Today,
many people—over 200 million—still lack access to safe family planning, according to USAID (2010).
By their report, this need is growing, with demand projected to increase by 40 percent in the next 15
years. Many social scholars would assert that until women are able to have only the children they want
and can care for, the poorest countries will always bear the worst burden of overpopulation.

20.2 Urbanization

CHAPTER 20 | POPULATION, URBANIZATION, AND THE ENVIRONMENT

Figure 20.8 The lights of New York City are an iconic image of city life. (Photo courtesy of Or Hiltch/flickr)
Urbanization is the study of the social, political, and economic relationships in cities, and
someone specializing in urban sociology would study those relationships. In some ways, cities can be
microcosms of universal human behavior, while in others they provide a unique environment that yields
their own brand of human behavior. There is no strict dividing line between rural and urban; rather,
there is a continuum where one bleeds into the other. However, once a geographically concentrated
population has reached approximately 100,000 people, it typically behaves like a city regardless of
what its designation might be.

The Growth of Cities
According to sociologist Gideon Sjoberg (1965), there are three prerequisites for the development of a
city. First, good environment with fresh water and a favorable climate; second, advanced technology,
which will produce a food surplus to support non-farmers; and third, strong social organization to
ensure social stability and a stable economy. Most scholars agree that the first cities were developed
somewhere in ancient Mesopotamia, though there are disagreements about exactly where. Most early
cities were small by today’s standards, and the largest city at the time was most likely Rome, with about
650,000 inhabitants (Chandler and Fox 1974). The factors limiting the size of ancient cities included
lack of adequate sewage control, limited food supply, and immigration restrictions. For example, serfs
were tied to the land, and transportation was limited and inefficient. Today, the primary influence on
cities’ growth is economic forces. Since the recent economic recession has reduced housing prices,
researchers are waiting to see what happens to urban migration patterns in response.

Figure 20.9 As this chart illustrates, the shift from rural to urban living in the United States has been dramatic and
continuous. (Graph courtesy of the U.S. Census Bureau)

Urbanization in the United States
Urbanization in the United States proceeded rapidly during the Industrial Era. As more and more
opportunities for work appeared in factories, workers left farms (and the rural communities that housed
them) to move to the cities. From mill towns in Massachusetts to tenements in New York, the industrial
era saw an influx of poor workers into America’s cities. At various times throughout the country’s
history, certain demographic groups, from recent immigrants to post-Civil War southern Blacks, made
their way to urban centers to seek a better life in the city.
Upton Sinclair’s The Jungle (1906) offers a snapshot of the rapid change taking place at the time.
In the book, Sinclair explored the difficult living conditions and hideous and unsafe working conditions
in a Chicago-area meatpacking plant. The book brought the plight of the urban working poor to the

457

front and center of the public’s eye, as well as turning the stomachs of most modern readers with its
graphic discussion of food preparation before the advent of government regulation.

A Postmillennial Jungle: A Story of Coming of
Age in the Bronx
In 1906, Upton Sinclair’s book of the harsh life and difficult reality of the urban poor burst onto
the scene. Almost 100 years later in 2003, Adrien Nicole LeBlanc wrote Random Family: Love,
Drugs, Trouble, and Coming of Age in the Bronx. To write her book, LeBlanc spent 10 years with a
family in the Bronx, New York, following their struggles, their daily lives, and the extreme
difficulties of their urban existence. Her research methods and resulting work reflect the symbolic
interactionist perspective of sociology. Unlike most nonfiction books that focus on urban poverty
issues, Random Family is not about social or economic policies, declining teenage pregnancy
rates, welfare reform, or any of the other critical issues that matter to this demographic. It is the
story of a family, starting with two young women and following them through their relationships
with abusive boyfriends, through their first jobs (as heroin packers), and through the births of their
many children. LeBlanc does not judge them or offer advice, nor does she take the long view and
offer perspective on what confluences of history brought them to this place. Instead, she allows
readers to follow these young women on their painful attempt to get to a better place, despite
having no idea which way to go.
The book is eye-opening and offers a compelling look at today’s urban life in an intimate
portrait. The lives LeBlanc portrays are not unusual, nor does the book offer a trite solution. It
does offer a personal and up-close view of the people who make up the distressing urban statistics
that are part of American society.

Suburbs and Exurbs
As cities grew more crowded, and often more impoverished and costly, more and more people began to
migrate back out of them. But instead of returning to rural small towns (like they’d resided in before
moving to the city), these people needed close access to the cities for their jobs. In the 1850s, as the
urban population greatly expanded and transportation options improved, suburbs developed. Suburbs
are the communities surrounding cities, typically close enough for a daily commute in, but far enough
away to allow for more space than city living affords. The bucolic suburban landscape of the early 20th
century has largely disappeared due to sprawl. Suburban sprawl contributes to traffic congestion, which
in turn contributes to commuting time. And commuting times and distances have continued to increase
as new suburbs developed farther and farther from city centers. Simultaneously, this dynamic
contributed to an exponential increase in natural resource use, like petroleum, which sequentially
increased pollution in the form of carbon emissions.
As the suburbs became more crowded and lost their charm, those who could afford it turned to the
exurbs, communities that exist outside the ring of suburbs and are typically populated by even
wealthier families who want more space and have the resources to lengthen their commute. Together,

CHAPTER 20 | POPULATION, URBANIZATION, AND THE ENVIRONMENT

the suburbs, exurbs, and metropolitan areas all combine to form a metropolis. New York was the first
American megalopolis, a huge urban corridor encompassing multiple cities and their surrounding
suburbs. These metropolises use vast quantities of natural resources and are a growing part of the U.S.
landscape.

Suburbs Are Not All White Picket Fences: The
Banlieues of Paris
What makes a suburb a suburb? Simply, a suburb is a community surrounding a city. But when
you picture a suburb in your mind, your image may vary widely depending on which nation you
call home. In the United States, most consider the suburbs home to upper and middle class people
with private homes. In other countries, like France, the suburbs––or “banlieues”–– are
synonymous with housing projects and impoverished communities. In fact, the banlieues of Paris
are notorious for their ethnic violence and crime, with higher unemployment and more residents
living in poverty than in the city center. Further, the banlieues have a much higher immigrant
population, which in Paris is mostly Arabic and African immigrants. This contradicts the clichéd
American image of a typical white-picket-fence suburb.
In 2005, serious riots broke out in the banlieue of Clichy-sous-Bois after two boys were
electrocuted while hiding from the police. They were hiding, it is believed, because they were in
the wrong place at the wrong time, near the scene of a break-in, and they were afraid the police
would not believe their innocence. Only a few days earlier, interior minister Nicolas Sarkozy (who
later became president), gave a speech touting new measures against urban violence and referring
to the people of the banlieue as “rabble” (BBC 2005). After the deaths and subsequent riots,
Sarkozy reiterated his zero tolerance policy toward violence and sent in more police. Ultimately,
the violence spread across more than 30 towns and cities in France. Thousands of cars were
burned, many hundred were arrested, and both police and protesters suffered serious injuries.
Then-President Jacques Chirac responded by pledging more money for housing programs,
jobs programs, and education programs to help the banlieues solve the underlying problems that
led to such disastrous unrest. But none of the newly launched programs were effective. President
Sarkozy ran on a platform of tough regulations toward young offenders, and in 2007 the country
elected him. More riots ensued as a response to his election. In 2010, Sarkozy promised “war
without mercy” against the crime in the banlieues (France24 2010). Six years after the Clichysous-Bois riot, circumstances are no better for those in the banlieues.
As the above feature illustrates, the suburbs also have their share of socio-economic problems. In
the U.S., the trend of white flight refers to the migration of economically secure white people from
racially mixed urban areas toward the suburbs. This has happened throughout the 20th century—due to
causes as diverse as the legal end of racial segregation established by Brown v. Board of Education to
the Mariel boatlift of Cubans fleeing Cuba’s Mariel port for Miami. The issue only becomes more

459

460

CHAPTER 20 | POPULATION, URBANIZATION, AND THE ENVIRONMENT

complex as time goes on. Current trends include middle-class African-American families following
“white flight” patterns out of cities, while affluent whites return to cities that have historically had a
black majority. The result is that the issues of race, socio-economics, neighborhoods, and communities
remain complicated and challenging.

Urbanization around the World
As was the case in America, other coronations experienced a growth spurt during the Industrial Era.
The development of factories brought people from rural to urban areas, and new technology increased
the efficiency of transportation, food production, and food preservation. For example, from the
mid-1670s to the early 1900s, London increased its population from 550,000 to 7 million (Old Bailey
Proceedings Online 2011). The most recent phenomenon shaping urbanization around the world is the
development of postindustrial cities whose economic base depends on service and information rather
than the manufacturing of industry. The professional, educated class populates the postindustrial city,
and they expect convenient access to culturally based entertainment (libraries, museums, historical
downtowns, and the like) uncluttered by factories and the other features of an industrial city. Global
favorites like New York, London, and Tokyo are all examples of postindustrial cities. As cities evolve
from industrial to postindustrial, gentrification becomes more common. The practice of gentrification
refers to members of the middle and upper classes entering city areas that have been historically less
affluent and renovating properties while the poor urban underclass are forced by resulting price
pressures to leave those neighborhoods. This practice is widespread and the lower class is pushed into
increasingly decaying portions of the city.

Theoretical Perspectives on Urbanization
As the examples above illustrate, the issues of urbanization play significant roles in the study of
sociology. Race, economics, and human behavior intersect in cities. Let’s look at urbanization through
the sociological perspectives of functionalism and conflict theory. Functional perspectives on
urbanization focus generally on the ecology of the city, while conflict perspective tends to focus on
political economy.
Human ecology is a functionalist field of study that focuses on the relationship between people
and their built and natural physical environments (Park 1915). Generally speaking, urban land use and
urban population distribution occurs in a predictable pattern once we understand how people relate to
their living environment. For example, in the United States, we have a transportation system geared to
accommodate individuals and families in the form of interstate highways built for cars. In contrast,
most parts of Europe emphasize public transportation such as high-speed rail and commuter lines, as
well as walking and bicycling. The challenge for a human ecologist working in American urban
planning would be to design landscapes and waterscapes with natural beauty, while also figuring out
how to provide for free flowing transport of innumerable vehicles—not to mention parking!
The concentric zone model (Burgess 1925) is perhaps the most famous example of human
ecology. This model views a city as a series of concentric circular areas, expanding outward from the
center of the city, with various “zones” invading (new categories of people and businesses overrun the
edges of nearby zones) and succeeding (after invasion, the new inhabitants repurpose the areas they
have invaded and push out the previous inhabitants) adjacent zones. In this model, Zone A, in the heart
of the city, is the center of the business and cultural district. Zone B, the concentric circle surrounding
the city center, is composed of formerly wealthy homes split into cheap apartments for new immigrant
populations; this zone also houses small manufacturers, pawn shops, and other marginal businesses.
Zone C consists of the homes of the working class and established ethnic enclaves. Zone D consists of
wealthy homes, white-collar workers, and shopping centers. Zone E contains the estates of the upper
class (exurbs) and the suburbs.

Figure 20.12 This illustration depicts the concentric zones that make up a city. (Photo courtesy of Zeimusu/Wikimedia
Commons)

In contrast to the functionalist approach, theoretical models in the conflict perspective focus on the
way that urban areas change according to specific decisions made by political and economic leaders.

CHAPTER 20 | POPULATION, URBANIZATION, AND THE ENVIRONMENT

These decisions generally benefit the middle and upper classes while exploiting the working and lower
classes.
For example, sociologists Feagin and Parker (1990) suggested three aspects to understanding how
political and economic leaders control urban growth. First, economic and political leaders work
alongside each other to affect change in urban growth and decline, determining where money flows and
how land use is regulated. Second, exchange value and use value are balanced to favor the middle and
upper classes so that, for example, public land in poor neighborhoods may be rezoned for use as
industrial land. Finally, urban development is dependent on both structure (groups such as local
government) and agency (individuals including businessmen and activists), and these groups engage in
a push-pull dynamic that determines where and how land is actually used. For example, NIMBY (Not
In My Backyard) movements are more likely to emerge in middle and upper-class neighborhoods, so
these groups have more control over the usage of local land.

Figure 20.13 Are children in other countries paying the price for core nation childcare? (Photo courtesy of

For some women, caring for their children is a part of everyday life. For others, caring for
other people’s children is a job, and often it is a job that takes them away from their own families
and increasingly, their own countries. Feminist sociologists (a branch of the conflict theory
perspective) find topics like these rich sources of research for the discipline.
A 2001 article by sociologist Arlie Hochschild in American Prospect magazine discusses the
global phenomenon of women leaving their own families behind in developing countries in order
to come to America to be a nanny for wealthy U.S. families. These women’s own children, left
behind, might be looked after by an older sibling, a spouse, or a paid care worker. These workers
leave their countries to earn $400 a week as a nanny in the U.S., sending home $40 a week to pay
the caregiver for their own children (Hochschild 2001). The Commercialization of Intimate Life is
Hochschild’s book on the subject.
The statistics are startling. Over half the people immigrating to the United States are women,
mostly between the ages of 25 and 34. Many of them find employment as domestic workers, and
the demand for this type of care in the U.S. is rising. The number of American women in the
workforce rose from 28.8 percent in 1950 to 47 percent in 2010 (Waite 1981; United States
Department of Labor 2010). Simultaneously, the number of American families that rely on
relatives to care for children is steadily decreasing. So the search for trusted, professional care for
their children has become a priority worth paying for.
So what is the impact of these “global care chains,” as the article calls them? What does it
mean for the children left behind? The American children being cared for? The parents? There are
no easy answers to these questions, but it does not mean they should not be asked.

461

462

CHAPTER 20 | POPULATION, URBANIZATION, AND THE ENVIRONMENT

Just as a conscientious consumer would pay attention to the company that makes her sneakers
or computer, so too do we need to pay attention to who is sacrificing what to care for core nation
children. This is not to say it is exploitative to hire a nanny from overseas. Many women come to
the United States expressly for the purpose of finding those jobs that enable them to send enough
money home to pay for schooling and a better life. They do this in the hopes that, someday, their
own children will have better opportunities (Hochschild 2001).

20.3 The Environment and Society
The subfield of environmental sociology studies how humans interact with their environments. This
field is closely related to human ecology, which focuses on the relationship between people and their
built and natural environment. This is an area that is garnering more attention as extreme weather
patterns and policy battles over climate change dominate the news. A key factor of environmental
sociology is the concept of carrying capacity, which refers to the maximum amount of life that can be
sustained within a given area. While this concept can refer to grazing lands or to rivers, it also can be
applied to the earth as a whole.

Figure 20.14 Too little land for grazing means starving cattle. (Photo courtesy of newbeatphoto/flickr)

the

The Tragedy of the Commons
You might have heard the expression “the tragedy of the commons.” In 1968, an article of the
same title written by Garrett Hardin describes how a common pasture is ruined by overgrazing.
But Hardin was not the first to notice the phenomenon. Back in the 1800s, Oxford economist
William Forster Lloyd looked at the devastated public grazing commons and the unhealthy cattle
subject to such limited grazing, and saw, in essence, that the carrying capacity of the commons had
been exceeded. However, since no one held responsibility for the land (as it was open to all), no
one was willing to make sacrifices to improve it. Cattle grazers benefitted from adding more cattle
to their herd, but they did not have to take on the responsibility of the destroyed lands that were
being damaged by overgrazing. So there was an incentive for them to add more head of cattle, and
no incentive for restraint.
Satellite photos of Africa taken in the 1970s showed this practice to dramatic effect. The
images depicted a dark irregular area over 300 miles around. When seen from above, there was a
large fenced area, where plenty of grass was growing. Outside the fence, the ground was bare and
devastated. The reason was simple: the fenced land was privately owned by informed farmers who
carefully rotated their grazing animals and allowed the fields to lie fallow periodically. Outside the
fence was land used by nomads. The nomads, like the herdsmen in 1800s Oxford, increased their
heads of cattle without planning for its impact on the greater good. The soil eroded, the plants
died, then the cattle died, and, ultimately, some of the people died.
How does this affect those of us who don’t need to graze our cattle? Well, like the cows, we
all need food, water, and clean air to survive. With the increasing world population and the everlarger megalopolises with tens of millions of people, the limit of the earth’s carrying capacity is

CHAPTER 20 | POPULATION, URBANIZATION, AND THE ENVIRONMENT

called into question. Whether for cattle or humans, when too many take with too little thought to
the rest of the population, the result is usually tragedy.

Pollution
Pollution describes when contaminants are introduced into an environment (water, air, land) at levels
that are damaging. Directly related to carrying capacity, environments can often sustain a limited
amount of contaminants without marked change, and water, air, and soil can “heal” themselves to a
certain degree. However, once contaminant levels reach a certain point, the results can be catastrophic.
Water
Look at your watch. Wait 15 seconds. Then another 15. In that time, two children have died from lack
of access to clean drinking water. Access to safe water is one of the most basic human needs, and it is
woefully out of reach for millions of people on the planet. Many of the major diseases that peripheral
countries battle, such as diarrhea, cholera, and typhoid, are caused by contaminated water. Often, young
children are unable to go to school because they must instead walk several hours a day just to collect
potable water for their family. The situation is only getting more dire as the global population increases.
Water is a key resource battleground in the 21st century.
As every child learns in school, 70 percent of Earth is made of water. Despite that figure, there is a
finite amount of water usable by humans and it is constantly used and reused in a sustainable water
cycle. The way that humans use this abundant natural resource, however, renders much of it unsuitable
for consumption and unable to sustain life. For instance, it takes two and a half liters of water to
produce a single liter of Coca-Cola. The company and its bottlers use close to 300 billion liters of water
a year, often in locales that are short of useable water (Blanchard 2007).
As a consequence of population concentrations, water close to human settlements is frequently
polluted with untreated or partially treated human waste (sewage), chemicals, radioactivity, and levels
of heat sufficient to create large “dead zones” incapable of supporting aquatic life. The methods of food
production used by many core nations rely on liberal doses of nitrogen and pesticides, which end up
back in the water supply. In some cases, water pollution affects the quality of the aquatic life consumed
by water and land animals. As we move along the food chain, the pollutants travel from prey to
predator. Since humans consume at all levels of the food chain, we ultimately consume the carcinogens,
such as mercury, accumulated through several branches of the food web.
Soil
Some of you might have read The Grapes of Wrath in English class years ago. Steinbeck’s tale of the
Joads, driven out of their home by the Dust Bowl, is still playing out today. In China, as in Depressionera Oklahoma, over-tilling soil in an attempt to expand agriculture has resulted in the disappearance of
large patches of topsoil.
Soil erosion and desertification are just two of the many forms of soil pollution. In addition, all of
the chemicals and pollutants that harm our water supplies can also leach into soil with similar effects.
Brown zones where nothing can grow are common results of soil pollution. One demand of the
population boom on the planet is an attendant requirement for more food to be produced. The so-called
“Green Revolution” in the 1960s saw chemists and world aid organizations working together to bring
modern farming methods, complete with pesticides, to developing countries. The immediate result was
positive: food yields went up and burgeoning populations were fed. But as time has gone on, these areas
have fallen into even more difficult straits as the damage done by modern methods leave traditional
farmers with less than they had to start.
Dredging certain beaches in an attempt to maintain valuable beachfront property from coastal
erosion has resulted in greater storm impact on shorelines, and damage to beach ecosystems (Turneffe
Atoll Trust 2008). The results of these dredging projects have damaged reefs, sea grass beds, and
shorelines, and can kill off large swaths of marine life. Ultimately, this damage threatens local fisheries,
tourism, and other parts of the local economy.
Garbage

CHAPTER 20 | POPULATION, URBANIZATION, AND THE ENVIRONMENT

Figure 20.15 Where should garbage go when you’ve run out of room? This is a question that is increasingly pressing the
planet. (Photo courtesy of Kevin Krejci/flickr)

Where is your last cell phone? What about the one before that? Or the huge old television set your
family had before flat screens became popular? For most of us, the answer is a sheepish shrug. We
don’t pay attention to the demise of old items, and since electronics drop in price and increase in
innovation at an incredible clip, we have been trained by their manufacturers to upgrade frequently.
Garbage creation and control are major issues for most core and industrializing nations, quickly
becoming one of the most critical environmental issues faced in America. Americans buy products, use
them, and then throw them away. When you got rid of those old electronics, where did they go? Did
you dispose of them according to government safety guidelines? Chances are good you didn’t even
know there are guidelines. Multiply your electronics times a few million, take into account the
numerous toxic chemicals they contain, and then imagine either burying those chemicals in the ground,
or lighting them on fire.
There are two primary means of waste disposal in the U.S.: landfill and incineration. When it
comes to dangerous toxins, neither is a good choice. In the case of more innocuous trash, the synthetic
Styrofoam and plastics that many of us use every day do not dissolve in a natural way. Burn them, and
they release carcinogens into the air. Their improper (intentional or not) incineration adds to air
pollution and increases smog. Dump them in landfills, and they do not decompose. As landfill sites fill
up, we risk an increase in groundwater contamination.

What Should Apple (and Friends) Do about EWaste?

Figure 20.16 A parking lot filled with electronic waste, known as e-waste. (Photo courtesy of U.S. Army
Environmental Command/flickr)

Electronic waste, or e-waste, is one of the fastest growing segments of garbage. And it is far
more problematic than even the mountains of broken plastic and rusty metal that plague the
environment. E-waste is the name for obsolete, broken, and worn-out electronics—from
computers to mobile phones to televisions. The challenge is that these products, which are
multiplying at alarming rates thanks in part to planned obsolescence (designing products to
quickly become outdated and then replaced by the constant emergence of newer and cheaper

CHAPTER 20 | POPULATION, URBANIZATION, AND THE ENVIRONMENT

electronics), have toxic chemicals and precious metals in them, which makes for a dangerous
combination.
So where do they go? Many companies ship their e-waste to developing nations in Africa and
Asia to be “recycled.” While they are, in some senses, recycled, the result is not exactly clean. In
fact, it is one of the dirtiest jobs around. Overseas, without the benefit of environmental regulation,
e-waste dumps become a kind of boomtown for entrepreneurs willing to sort through endless
stacks of broken-down electronics for tiny bits of valuable copper, silver, and other precious
metals. Unfortunately, in their hunt, these workers are exposed to deadly toxins.
Governments are beginning to take notice of the impending disaster, and the European Union,
as well as the state of California, has put stricter regulations in place. These regulations both limit
the amount of toxins allowed in electronics and address the issue of end-of-life recycling. But not
surprisingly, corporations, while insisting they are greening their process, often fight stricter
regulations. Meanwhile, many environmental groups, including the activist group Greenpeace,
have taken up the cause. Greenpeace states that it is working to get companies to:
1. measure and reduce emissions with energy efficiency, renewable energy, and energy policy

2. make greener, efficient, longer lasting products that are free of hazardous substance
3. reduce environmental impacts throughout company operations, from materials and energy
used to make products right through to global take-back programs for old products
(Greenpeace 2011).
Greenpeace produces annual ratings of how well companies are meeting these goals so that
consumers can see how brands stack up. For instance, Apple moved up five spots since the 2010
report. Hopefully, consumers will vote with their wallets, and the greener companies will be
rewarded.
Air
China’s fast-growing economy and burgeoning industry have translated into notoriously poor air
quality. Smog hangs heavily over the major cities, sometimes grounding aircraft that cannot navigate
through it. Pedestrians and cyclists wear masks to protect themselves. In Beijing, citizens are skeptical
that the government-issued daily pollution ratings are trustworthy. Increasingly, they are taking their
own pollution measurements in the hopes that accurate information will galvanize others to action.
Given that some days they can barely see down the street, they hope that action comes soon (Papenfuss
2011).
Humanity, with its growing population, use of fossil fuels, and increasingly urbanized society, is
putting too much stress on the earth’s atmosphere. The amount of air pollution varies from locale to
locale, and you may be more personally affected than you realize. How often do you check air quality
reports before leaving your house? Depending on where you live, this question can sound utterly
strange or like an everyday matter. Along with oxygen, most of the time we are also breathing in soot,
hydrocarbons, carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur oxides. As discussed above, in some parts of the world, it is
a necessity for people to check air quality levels, and it is not uncommon to wear air filters on
particularly bad days.
Much of the pollution in the air comes from human activity. How many college students move
their cars across campus at least once a day? Who checks the environmental report card on how many
pollutants each company throws into the air before purchasing a cell phone? Many of us are guilty of
taking our environment for granted without concern for how everyday decisions add up to a long-term
global problem. How many minor adjustments can you think of, like walking instead of driving, that
would reduce your overall carbon footprint?
Remember the example of the “tragedy of the commons.” Each of us is affected by air pollution.
But like the herder who adds one more head of cattle to realize the benefits of owning more cows, but
who does not have to pay the price of the overgrazed land, we take the benefit of driving or buying the
latest cell phones without worrying about the end result. Air pollution accumulates in the body, much
like the effects of smoking cigarettes accumulate over time, leading to more chronic illnesses. And in
addition to directly affecting human health, air pollution affects crop quality as well as heating and
cooling costs. In other words, we all pay a lot more than the price at the pump when we fill up our tank
with gas.

Toxic and Radioactive Waste
Radioactivity is a form of air pollution. While nuclear energy promises a safe and abundant power
source, increasingly it is looked upon as a danger to the environment and to those who inhabit it. We
accumulate nuclear waste, which we must then keep track of long term and ultimately figure out how to
store the toxic waste material without damaging the environment or putting future generations at risk.
The recent earthquake in Japan illustrates the dangers of even safe, government-monitored nuclear
energy. When disaster occurs, how can we safely evacuate the large numbers of affected people?
Indeed, how can we even be sure how far the evacuation radius should extend? Radiation can also enter
the food chain, causing damage from the bottom (phytoplankton and microscopic soil organisms) all the
way to the top. Once again, the price paid for cheap power is much greater than what is seen on the
electric bill.

Horizon spill. (Photo courtesy of Jeff Warren/flickr)

The enormous oil disaster that hit the Louisiana Gulf Coast is just one of a frighteningly high
number of environmental crises that have led to toxic residue. From the Love Canal neighborhood of
the 1970s to the Exxon Valdez oil tanker crash of 1989, from the Chernobyl disaster of 1986 to Japan’s
Fukushima nuclear plant incident in 2011—the list goes on. Often, the stories are not newsmakers, but
simply an unpleasant part of life for the people who live near toxic sites such as in the stories of
Centralia, Pennsylvania and Hinkley, California. In many cases, people in these neighborhoods can be
part of a cancer cluster without realizing the cause.

business. (Photo courtesy of AV8ter/flickr)

Climate Change
World systems analysis suggests that core nations (like the U.S. and Western Europe) were historically
the greatest source of greenhouse gases, but have now evolved into postindustrial societies. Now that
semi-peripheral and peripheral nations are industrializing, the core nations wish to enact strict protocols
regarding the causes of global warming (since their economies are no longer so dependent on
greenhouse-gas-causing industries). However, the semi-peripheral and peripheral nations rightly point
out that they only want the same economic chance to evolve their economies, and since they were
unduly affected by the progress of core nations, if the core nations now insist on “green” policies, they
should pay offsets or subsidies of some kind. There are no easy answers to this conflict. It may well not
be “fair” that the core nations benefited from ignorance during their industrial boom. But with China
leading the way as a top greenhouse gas emitter, it matters less to the planet whether they get their fair
shake at polluting. The international community continues to work toward a way to manage climate
change. The Durban Talks that concluded in December 2011 point to a willingness by both core

CHAPTER 20 | POPULATION, URBANIZATION, AND THE ENVIRONMENT

countries and peripheral nations to move toward a legally binding instrument for all countries (World
Resource Institute 2011).
Climate change, which used to be called global warming, is a deeply controversial subject, despite
decades of scientific research that demonstrates its existence. Climate change refers to long-term shifts
in temperatures due to human activity and, in particular, the release of greenhouse gases into the
environment. While the planet as a whole is warming––hence the term global warming––the term
climate change is now used because the short-term variations can include higher or lower temperatures,
despite the overarching trend toward warmth. Another effect is more extreme weather. There are
increasingly more record-breaking weather phenomena, from the number of Category 4 hurricanes to
the amount of snowfall in a given winter. These extremes, while they make for dramatic television
coverage, can cause immeasurable damage to crops, property, and even lives.
So why is climate change a controversy? The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric
Association (NOAA) recognizes its existence. So do the close to 200 countries that signed the Kyoto
Protocol, a document intended to engage countries in voluntary actions to limit the activity that leads to
climate change. (The United States was not one of the 200 nations committed to this initiative to reduce
environmental damage, and the refusal to sign continues to be a source of contention.) So what’s the
argument about? Well, for the companies making billions of dollars in the production of goods and
services, climate change is a dirty concept indeed. The idea of costly regulations that would require
expensive operational upgrades has been a source of great anxiety to much of the business community,
and as a rebuttal they argue, via lobbyists, that such regulations would be disastrous for the economy.
Some go so far as to question the science used as evidence. There is a lot of finger-pointing among
countries, especially when the issue arises of who “gets” to pollute.

From breakfast cereals to sports cars, we are used to seeing our favorite actors touting
products of all kinds. But what about environmental causes? Who is more trustworthy when it
comes to promoting the health of our planet: former vice-president Al Gore or international
superstar Angelina Jolie? According to a report by Nielsen and the Environmental Change
Institute, the answer may vary depending on what country you’re in. Globally, Kofi Annan and Al
Gore won top spots as trustworthy spokespeople, but among respondents under age 25, Oprah
Winfrey and Angelina Jolie joined Kofi as the most influential spokespeople. And regionally,
results varied, with some countries preferring rock stars while others liked getting their
environmental messages from sports heroes (Nielsen 2007).

CHAPTER 20 | POPULATION, URBANIZATION, AND THE ENVIRONMENT

Why do we trust the message when it comes from these sources? Most of us don’t think that
these famous people are scientists in their own right, so it is unclear why their word regarding
climate change is so valuable. But it clearly is. Many environmental nonprofits have connected
with a celebrity to help them raise money and awareness. But before you write a check to Angelina
Jolie’s favorite charity or support Bono’s most recent project, it is important to look behind the
celebrity, and at the organizations themselves.

Environmental Racism
Environmental racism refers to the way in which minority group neighborhoods (populated primarily
by people of color and members of low socioeconomic groups) are burdened with a disproportionate
number of hazards, including toxic waste facilities, garbage dumps, and other sources of environmental
pollution and foul odors that lower the quality of life. All around the globe, members of minority
groups bear a greater burden of the health problems resulting from higher exposure to waste and
pollution. This can occur due to unsafe or unhealthy work conditions where no regulations exist (or are
enforced) for poor workers, or in neighborhoods that are uncomfortably close to toxic materials.
The statistics on environmental racism are shocking. When studying the impact on African
Americans, research shows that it pervades all aspects of their lives: environmentally unsound housing,
schools with asbestos problems, facilities and playgrounds with lead paint. A 20-year comparative
study led by sociologist Robert Bullard determined “race to be more important than socioeconomic
status in predicting the location of the nation’s commercial hazardous waste facilities” (Bullard et al.
2007). His research found, for example, that African American children are five times more likely to
have lead poisoning (the leading environmental health threat for children) than their Caucasian
counterparts, and that a disproportionate number of people of color reside in areas with hazardous waste
facilities (Bullard et al. 2007). Sociologists involved with the project are examining how environmental
racism is addressed in the long-term cleanup of the environmental disasters caused by Hurricane
Katrina.

Making Connections:

the

Big Picture

American Indian Tribes and Environmental
Racism
Native Americans are unquestionably victims of environmental racism. The Commission for
Racial Justice found that about 50 percent of all American Indians live in communities with
uncontrolled hazardous waste sites (Asian Pacific Environmental Network 2002). There’s no
question that, worldwide, indigenous populations are suffering from similar fates.
For Native American tribes, the issues can be complicated—and their solutions hard to
attain—because of the complicated governmental issues arising from a history of institutionalized
disenfranchisement. Unlike other racial minorities in the U.S., Native American tribes are
sovereign nations. However, much of their land is held in “trust,” meaning that “the federal
government holds title to the land in trust on behalf of the tribe” (Bureau of Indian Affairs 2012).
Some instances of environmental damage arise from this crossover, where the U.S. government’s
title has meant it acts without approval of the tribal government. Other significant contributors to
environmental racism as experienced by tribes are forcible removal and preposterous red tape to
receive the same reparation benefits afforded to non-Indians.
To better understand how this happens, let’s consider a few example cases. The Skull Valley
Band of Goshute Indians was targeted as the site for a high-level nuclear waste dumping ground,
amid allegations of a payoff of as high as $200 million (Kamps 2001). Keith Lewis, an indigenous
advocate for Indian rights, commented on this buyout, after his people endured decades of uranium
contamination, saying that “there is nothing moral about tempting a starving man with money”
(Kamps 2001). In another example, the Western Shoshone’s Yucca Mountain area has been
pursued by mining companies for its rich uranium stores, a threat that adds to the existing radiation
exposure this area suffers from U.S. and British nuclear bomb testing (Environmental Justice Case
Studies 2004). In the “four corners” area where Colorado, Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico meet, a

CHAPTER 20 | POPULATION, URBANIZATION, AND THE ENVIRONMENT

group of Hopi and Navajo families have been forcibly removed from their homes so the land could
be mined by the Peabody Mining Company for coal valued at $10 billion (American Indian
Cultural Support 2006). Years of uranium mining on the lands of the Navajo of New Mexico have
led to serious health consequences, and reparations have been difficult to secure; in addition to the
loss of life, people’s homes and other facilities have been contaminated (Frosch 2009). In yet
another case, members of the Chippewa near White Pine, Michigan, were unable to stop the
transport of hazardous sulfuric acid across reservation lands, but their activism helped bring an end
to the mining project that used the acid (Environmental Justice Case Studies 2004).
These examples are only a few of the hundreds of incidents that American Indian tribes have
faced and continue to battle against. Sadly, the mistreatment of the land’s original inhabitants
continues via this institution of environmental racism. How might the work of sociologists help
draw attention to—and eventually mitigate—this social problem?
Why does environmental racism exist? The reason is simple. Those with resources can raise
awareness, money, and public attention to ensure that their communities are unsullied. This has led to
an inequitable distribution of environmental burdens. Another method of keeping this inequity alive is
NIMBY protests. NIMBY, or Not in My Back Yard, is the name for a movement of engaged citizens
who are mostly protesting something objectionable that will happen to them, rather than its existence at
all. Chemical plants, airports, landfills, and other municipal or corporate projects are often the subject
of NIMBY demonstrations. And equally often, the NIMBYists win, and the objectionable project is
moved closer to those who have fewer resources to fight it.

Section Summary
20.1 Demography and Population
Scholars understand demography through various analyses. Malthusian, Zero Population Growth,
Cornucopian theory, and Demographic Transition theories all help sociologists study demography. The
earth’s human population is growing quickly, especially in peripheral countries. Factors that impact
population include birthrates, mortality rates, and migration, including immigration and emigration.
There are numerous potential outcomes of the growing population, and sociological perspectives vary
on the potential effect of these increased numbers. The growth will pressure the already taxed planet
and its natural resources.

20.2 Urbanization
Cities provide numerous opportunities for their residents and offer significant benefits including access
to goods to numerous job opportunities. At the same time, high population areas can lead to tensions
between demographic groups, as well as environmental strain. While the population of urban dwellers
is continuing to rise, sources of social strain are rising along with it. The ultimate challenge for today’s
urbanites is finding an equitable way to share the city’s resources while reducing the pollution and
energy use that negatively impacts the environment.

20.3 The Environment and Society
The area of environmental sociology is growing as extreme weather patterns and concerns over climate
change increase. Human activity leads to pollution of soil, water, and air, compromising the health of
the entire food chain. While everyone is at risk, poor and disadvantaged neighborhoods and nations
bear a greater burden of the planet’s pollution, a dynamic known as environmental racism.

CHAPTER 21 | SOCIAL MOVEMENTS AND SOCIAL CHANGE

Introduction to Social Movements and Social Change
In January 2011, Egypt erupted in protests against the stifling rule of longtime President Hosni
Mubarak. The protests were sparked in part by the revolution in Tunisia, and, in turn, they inspired
demonstrations throughout the Middle East in Libya, Syria, and beyond. This wave of protest
movements traveled across national borders and seemed to spread like wildfire. There have been
countless causes and factors in play in these protests and revolutions, but many have noted the internetsavvy youth of these countries. Some believe that the adoption of social technology—from Facebook
pages to cell phone cameras—that helped to organize and document the movement contributed directly
to the wave of protests called Arab Spring. The combination of deep unrest and disruptive technologies
meant these social movements were ready to rise up and seek change.
What do Arab Spring, Occupy Wall Street, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA),
the anti-globalization movement, and the Tea Party have in common? Not much, you might think. But
although they may be left-wing or right-wing, radical or conservative, highly organized or very
diffused, they are all examples of social movements.
Social movements are purposeful, organized groups striving to work toward a common goal.
These groups might be attempting to create change (Occupy Wall Street, Arab Spring), to resist change
(anti-globalization movement), or to provide a political voice to those otherwise disenfranchised (civil
rights movements). Social movements, along with technology, social institutions, population, and
environmental changes, create social change.
Consider the effect of the 2010 BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. This disaster exemplifies how a
change in the environment, coupled with the use of technology to fix that change, combined with antioil sentiment in social movements and social institutions, led to changes in offshore oil drilling policies.
Subsequently, in an effort to support the Gulf Coast’s rebuilding efforts, new changes occurred. From
grassroots marketing campaigns that promote consumption of local seafood to municipal governments
needing to coordinate with federal cleanups, organizations develop and shift to meet the changing needs
of the society. Just as we saw with the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, social movements have, throughout
history, influenced societal shifts. Sociology looks at these moments through the lenses of three major
perspectives.
The functionalist perspective looks at the big picture, focusing on the way that all aspects of
society are integral to the continued health and viability of the whole. When studying social
movements, a functionalist might focus on why social movements develop, why they continue to exist,
and what social purposes they serve. For example, movements must change their goals as initial aims
are met or they risk dissolution. Several organizations associated with the anti-polio industry folded
after the creation of an effective vaccine that made the disease virtually disappear. Can you think of
another social movement whose goals were met? What about one whose goals have changed over time?
The conflict perspective focuses on the creation and reproduction of inequality. Someone applying
the conflict perspective would likely be interested in how social movements are generated through
systematic inequality, and how social change is constant, speedy, and unavoidable. In fact, the conflict
that this perspective sees as inherent in social relations drives social change. For example, the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) was founded in 1908. Partly created in
response to the horrific lynchings occurring in the southern United States, the organization fought to
secure the constitutional rights guaranteed in the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments, which established
an end to slavery, equal protection under the law, and universal male suffrage (NAACP 2011). While
those goals have been achieved, the organization remains active today, continuing to fight against
inequalities in civil rights and to remedy discriminatory practices.
The symbolic interaction perspective studies the day-to-day interaction of social movements, the
meanings individuals attach to involvement in such movements, and the individual experience of social
change. An interactionist studying social movements might address social movement norms and tactics
as well as individual motivations. For example, social movements might be generated through a feeling
of deprivation or discontent, but people might actually join social movements for a variety of reasons
that have nothing to do with the cause. They might want to feel important, or they know someone in the
movement they want to support, or they just want to be a part of something. Have you ever been
motivated to show up for a rally or sign a petition because your friends invited you? Would you have
been as likely to get involved otherwise?

Flash Mobs

Figure 21.2 Is this a good time had by all? Some flash mobs may function as political protests, while others are for
fun. This flash mob pillow fight’s purpose was to entertain. (Photo courtesy of Mattwi1S0n:/flickr)

People sitting in a café in a touristy corner of Rome might expect the usual sights and sounds of a
busy city. They might be more surprised when, as they sip their espressos, hundreds of young
people start streaming into the picturesque square clutching pillows, and when someone gives a
signal, they start pummeling each other in a massive free-for-all pillow fight. Spectators might
lean forward, coffee forgotten, as feathers fly and more and more people join in. All around the
square, others hang out of their windows or stop on the street, transfixed, to watch. After several
minutes, the spectacle is over. With cheers and the occasional high five, the crowd disperses,
leaving only destroyed pillows and clouds of fluff in its wake.
This is a flash mob, a large group of people who gather together in a spontaneous activity
that lasts a limited amount of time before returning to their regular routines. Technology plays a
big role in the creation of a flash mob: select people are texted or emailed, and the message
spreads virally until a crowd has grown. But while technology might explain the “how” of flash
mobs, it does not explain the “why.” Flash mobs often are captured on video and shared on the
internet; frequently they go viral and become well-known. So what leads people to want to flock
somewhere for a massive pillow fight? Or for a choreographed dance? Or to freeze in place? Why
is this appealing? In large part, it is as simple as the reason humans have bonded together around
fires for storytelling, or danced together, or joined a community holiday celebration. Humans seek
connections and shared experiences. And a flash mob, pillows included, provides a way to make
that happen.

Forms of Collective Behavior
Flash mobs are examples of collective behavior, non-institutionalized activity in which several people
voluntarily engage. Other examples of collective behavior can include anything from a group of
commuters traveling home from work to the trend toward adopting the Justin Bieber hair flip. In short,
it can be any group behavior that is not mandated or regulated by an institution. There are four primary
forms of collective behavior: the crowd, the mass, the public, and social movements.
It takes a fairly large number of people in close proximity to form a crowd (Lofland 1993).
Examples include a group of people attending an Ani DiFranco concert, tailgating at a Patriots game, or
attending a worship service. Turner and Killian (1993) identified four types of crowds. Casual crowds
consist of people who are in the same place at the same time, but who aren’t really interacting, such as
people standing in line at the post office. Conventional crowds are those who come together for a
scheduled event occurring regularly, like a religious service. Expressive crowds are people who join
together to express emotion, often at funerals, weddings, or the like. The final type, acting crowds,
focus on a specific goal or action, such as a protest movement or riot.

CHAPTER 21 | SOCIAL MOVEMENTS AND SOCIAL CHANGE

In addition to the different types of crowds, collective groups can also be identified in two other
ways. A mass is a relatively large number of people with a common interest, though they may not be in
close proximity (Lofland 1993), such as players of the popular Facebook game Farmville. A public, on
the other hand, is an unorganized, relatively diffused group of people who share ideas, such as the
Libertarian political party. While these two types of crowds are similar, they are not the same. To
distinguish between them, remember that members of a mass share interests whereas members of a
public share ideas.

Theoretical Perspectives on Collective Behavior
Early collective behavior theories (LeBon 1895; Blumer 1969) focused on the irrationality of crowds.
Eventually, those theorists who viewed crowds as uncontrolled groups of irrational people were
supplanted by theorists who viewed the behavior some crowds engaged in as the rational behavior of
logical beings.
Emergent-Norm Perspective

Figure 21.3 According to the emergent-norm perspective, people have their own reasons for joining a parade. (Photo

Sociologists Ralph Turner and Lewis Killian (1993) built on earlier sociological ideas and developed
what is known as emergent norm theory. They believe that the norms experienced by people in a crowd
may be disparate and fluctuating. They emphasize the importance of these norms in shaping crowd
behavior, especially those norms that shift quickly in response to changing external factors. Emergent
norm theory asserts that, in this circumstance, people perceive and respond to the crowd situation with
their particular (individual) set of norms, which may change as the crowd experience evolves. This
focus on the individual component of interaction reflects a symbolic interactionist perspective.
For Turner and Killian, the process begins when individuals suddenly find themselves in a new
situation, or when an existing situation suddenly becomes strange or unfamiliar. For example, think
about human behavior during Hurricane Katrina. New Orleans was decimated and people were trapped
without supplies or a way to evacuate. In these extraordinary circumstances, what outsiders saw as
“looting” was defined by those involved as seeking needed supplies for survival. Normally, individuals
would not wade into a corner gas station and take canned goods without paying, but given that they
were suddenly in a greatly changed situation, they established a norm that they felt was reasonable.
Once individuals find themselves in a situation ungoverned by previously established norms, they
interact in small groups to develop new guidelines on how to behave. According to the emergent-norm
perspective, crowds are not viewed as irrational, impulsive, uncontrolled groups. Instead, norms
develop and are accepted as they fit the situation. While this theory offers insight into why norms
develop, it leaves undefined the nature of norms, how they come to be accepted by the crowd, and how
they spread through the crowd.
Value-Added Theory
Neil Smelser’s (1962) meticulous categorization of crowd behavior, called value-added theory, is a
perspective within the functionalist tradition based on the idea that several conditions must be in place
for collective behavior to occur. Each condition adds to the likelihood that collective behavior will
occur. The first condition is structural conduciveness, which describes when people are aware of the
problem and have the opportunity to gather, ideally in an open area. Structural strain, the second
condition, refers to people’s expectations about the situation at hand being unmet, causing tension and
strain. The next condition is the growth and spread of a generalized belief, wherein a problem is clearly
identified and attributed to a person or group.

CHAPTER 21 | SOCIAL MOVEMENTS AND SOCIAL CHANGE

Fourth, precipitating factors spur collective behavior; this is the emergence of a dramatic event.
The fifth condition is mobilization for action, when leaders emerge to direct a crowd to action. The final
condition relates to action by the agents. Called social control, itis the only way to end the collective
behavior episode (Smelser 1962).
Let’s consider a hypothetical example of these conditions. In structure conduciveness (awareness
and opportunity), a group of students gathers on the campus quad. Structural strain emerges when they
feel stress concerning their high tuition costs. If the crowd decides that the latest tuition hike is the fault
of the Chancellor, and that she’ll lower tuition if they protest, then growth and spread of a generalized
belief has occurred. A precipitation factor arises when campus security appears to disperse the crowd,
using pepper spray to do so. When the student body president sits down and passively resists attempts
to stop the protest, this represents mobilization of action. Finally, when local police arrive and direct
students back to their dorms, we’ve seen agents of social control in action.
While value-added theory addresses the complexity of collective behavior, it also assumes that
such behavior is inherently negative or disruptive. In contrast, collective behavior can be nondisruptive, such as when people flood to a place where a leader or public figure has died to express
condolences or leave tokens of remembrance.

Assembling Perspective
Interactionist sociologist Clark McPhail (1991) developed assembling perspective, another system for
understanding collective behavior that credited individuals in crowds as rational beings. Unlike
previous theories, this theory refocuses attention from collective behavior to collective action.
Remember that collective behavior is a non-institutionalized gathering, whereas collective action is
based on a shared interest. McPhail’s theory focused primarily on the processes associated with crowd
behavior, plus the lifecycle of gatherings. He identified several instances of convergent or collective
behavior, as shown on the chart below.

481

As useful as this is for understanding the components of how crowds come together, many
sociologists criticize its lack of attention on the large cultural context of the described behaviors,
instead focusing on individual actions.

21.2 Social Movements
Social movements are purposeful, organized groups striving to work toward a common social goal.
While most of us learned about social movements in history classes, we tend to take for granted the
fundamental changes they caused —and we may be completely unfamiliar with the trend toward global
social movement. But from the anti-tobacco movement that has worked to outlaw smoking in public
buildings and raise the cost of cigarettes, to uprisings throughout the Arab world, movements are
creating social change on a global scale.

Levels of Social Movements
Movements happen in our towns, in our nation, and around the world. Let’s take a look at examples of
social movements, from local to global. No doubt you can think of others on all of these levels,
especially since modern technology has allowed us a near-constant stream of information about the
quest for social change around the world.
Local
Chicago is a city of highs and lows, from corrupt politicians and failing schools to innovative education
programs and a thriving arts scene. Not surprisingly, it has been home to a number of social movements
over time. Currently, AREA Chicago is a social movement focused on “building a socially just city”
(AREA Chicago 2011). The organization seeks to “create relationships and sustain community through
art, research, education, and activism” (AREA Chicago 2011). The movement offers online tools like
the Radicalendar––a calendar for getting radical and connected–– and events such as an alternative to
the traditional Independence Day picnic. Through its offerings, AREA Chicago gives local residents a
chance to engage in a movement to help build a socially just city.

CHAPTER 21 | SOCIAL MOVEMENTS AND SOCIAL CHANGE

State

Figure 21.5 Texas Secede! is an organization which would like Texas to secede from the United States. (Photo courtesy of
Tim Pearce/flickr)

At the other end of the political spectrum from AREA Chicago, there is a social movement across the
country in Texas. There, the statewide Texas Secede! organization promotes the idea that Texas can and
should secede from the United States to become an independent republic. The organization, which has
3,400 “likes” on Facebook, references both Texas and national history in promoting secession. The
movement encourages Texans to return to their rugged and individualistic roots, and to stand up to what
proponents believe is the theft of their rights and property by the U.S. government (Texas Secede!
2009).
National
A polarizing national issue which has helped spawn many activist groups is gay marriage. While the
legal battle is being played out state-by-state, the issue is a national one and crops up in presidential
debates quite frequently. There are ardent supporters on both sides of the issue.
The Human Rights Campaign, a nationwide organization that advocates for LGBT civil rights, has
been around for over 30 years and claims more than a million members. One focus of the organization
is their Americans for Marriage Equality campaign. Using public celebrities such as athletes, musicians,
and political figures, the campaigns seeks to engage the public in the issue of equal rights under the law.
The campaign raises awareness of the over 1,100 different rights, benefits, and protections provided on
the basis of marital status under federal law, and seeks to educate the public on why they believe these
protections are due to committed couples, regardless of gender (Human Rights Campaign 2011).
A movement on the opposite end would be the National Organization for Marriage, an
organization that funds campaigns to stop same-sex marriage (National Organization for Marriage
2011). Both of these organizations work on the national stage and seek to engage people through
grassroots efforts to push their message.

Global
Despite their successes in bringing forth change on controversial topics, social movements are not
always about volatile politicized issues. For example, let’s look at the global movement called Slow
Food. Slow Food, with the slogan “Good, Clean, Fair Food,” is a global grassroots movement claiming
supporters in 150 countries. The movement links community and environmental issues back to the
question of what is on our plates and where it came from. Founded in 1989 in response to the increasing

483

484

CHAPTER 21 | SOCIAL MOVEMENTS AND SOCIAL CHANGE

existence of fast food in communities that used to treasure their culinary traditions, Slow Food works to
raise awareness of food choices (Slow Food 2011). With more than 100,000 members in 1,300 local
chapters, Slow Food is a movement that crosses political, age, and regional lines.

Types of Social Movements
We know that social movements can occur on the local, national, or even global stage. Are there other
patterns or classifications that can help us understand them? Sociologist David Aberle (1966) addresses
this question, developing categories that distinguish among social movements based on what they want
to change and how much change they want. Reform movements seek to change something specific
about the social structure. Examples include anti-nuclear groups, Mothers Against Drunk Driving
(MADD), and the Human Rights Campaign’s advocacy for Marriage Equality. Revolutionary
movements seek to completely change every aspect of society. These would include the 1960’s
counterculture movement, as well as anarchist collectives. Texas Secede! is a revolutionary movement.
Religious/Redemptive movements are “meaning seeking,” and their goal is to provoke inner change
or spiritual growth in individuals. Organizations pushing these movements might include Heaven’s
Gate or the Branch Davidians. Alternative movements are focused on self-improvement and limited,
specific changes to individual beliefs and behavior. These include trends like transcendental meditation
or a macrobiotic diet. Resistance movements seek to prevent or undo change to the social structure.
The Ku Klux Klan and pro-life movements fall into this category.

Stages of Social Movements
Later sociologists studied the lifecycle of social movements—how they emerge, grow, and in some
cases, die out. Blumer (1969) and Tilly (1978) outline a four-stage process. In the preliminary stage,
people become aware of an issue and leaders emerge. This is followed by the coalescence stage when
people join together and organize in order to publicize the issue and raise awareness. In the
institutionalization stage, the movement no longer requires grassroots volunteerism: it is an established
organization, typically peopled with a paid staff. When people fall away, adopt a new movement, the
movement successfully brings about the change it sought, or people no longer take the issue seriously,
the movement falls into the decline stage. Each social movement discussed earlier belongs in one of
these four stages. Where would you put them on the list?

Social Media and Social Change: A Match
Made in Heaven

Figure 21.7 In 2008, Obama’s campaign used social media to tweet, like, and friend its way to victory. (Photos

Chances are you have been asked to tweet, friend, like, or donate online for a cause. Maybe you
were one of the many people who, in 2010, helped raise over $3 million in relief efforts for Haiti
through cell phone text donations. Or maybe you follow presidential candidates on Twitter and
retweet their messages to your followers. Perhaps you have “liked” a local nonprofit on Facebook,
prompted by one of your neighbors or friends liking it too. Nowadays, woven throughout our

CHAPTER 21 | SOCIAL MOVEMENTS AND SOCIAL CHANGE

social media activities, are social movements. After all, social movements start by activating
people.
Referring to the ideal type stages discussed above, you can see that social media has the
potential to dramatically transform how people get involved. Look at stage one, the preliminary
stage: people become aware of an issue and leaders emerge. Imagine how social media speeds up
this step. Suddenly, a shrewd user of Twitter can alert his thousands of followers about an
emerging cause or an issue on his mind. Issue awareness can spread at the speed of a click, with
thousands of people across the globe becoming informed at the same time. In a similar vein, those
who are savvy and engaged with social media emerge as leaders. Suddenly, you don’t need to be a
powerful public speaker. You don’t even need to leave your house. You can build an audience
through social media without ever meeting the people you are inspiring.
At the next stage, the coalescence stage, social media also is transformative. Coalescence is
the point when people join together to publicize the issue and get organized. President Obama’s
2008 campaign was a case study in organizing through social media. Using Twitter and other
online tools, the campaign engaged volunteers who had typically not bothered with politics, and
empowered those who were more active to generate still more activity. It is no coincidence that
Obama’s earlier work experience included grassroots community organizing. What is the
difference between his campaign and the work he did in Chicago neighborhoods decades earlier?
The ability to organize without regard to geographical boundaries by using social media. In 2009,
when student protests erupted in Tehran, social media was considered so important to the
organizing effort that the U.S. State Department actually asked Twitter to suspend scheduled
maintenance so that a vital tool would not be disabled during the demonstrations.
So what is the real impact of this technology on the world? Did Twitter bring down Mubarak
in Egypt? Author Malcolm Gladwell (2010) doesn’t think so. In an article in New Yorker
magazine, Gladwell tackles what he considers the myth that social media gets people more
engaged. He points out that most of the tweets relating to the Iran protests were in English and sent
from Western accounts (instead of people on the ground). Rather than increasing engagement, he
contends that social media only increases participation; after all, the cost of participation is so
much lower than the cost of engagement. Instead of risking being arrested, shot with rubber
bullets, or sprayed with fire hoses, social media activists can click “like” or retweet a message
from the comfort and safety of their desk (Gladwell 2010).
Sociologists have identified high-risk activism, such as the civil rights movement, as a
“strong-tie” phenomenon, meaning that people are far more likely to stay engaged and not run
home to safety if they have close friends who are also engaged. The people who dropped out of the
movement––who went home after the danger got too great––did not display any less ideological
commitment. But they lacked the strong-tie connection to other people who were staying. Social
media, by its very makeup, is “weak-tie” (McAdam and Paulsen 1993). People follow or friend
people they have never met. But while these online acquaintances are a source of information and
inspiration, the lack of engaged personal contact limits the level of risk we’ll take on their behalf.

CHAPTER 21 | SOCIAL MOVEMENTS AND SOCIAL CHANGE

Theoretical Perspectives on Social Movements
Most theories of social movements are called collective action theories, indicating the purposeful nature
of this form of collective behavior. The following three theories are but a few of the many classic and
modern theories developed by social scientists.
Resource Mobilization
Social movements will always be a part of society, and people will always weigh their options and
make rational choices about which movements to follow. As long as social movements wish to thrive,
they must find resources (such as money, people, and plans) for how to meet their goals. Not only will
social movements compete for our attention with many other concerns—from the basic (our jobs or our
need to feed ourselves) to the broad (video games, sports, or television), but they also compete with
each other. For any individual, it may be a simple matter to decide you want to spend your time and
money on animal shelters and Republican politics versus homeless shelters and Democrats. But which
animal shelter, and which Republican candidate? Social movements are competing for a piece of finite
resources, and the field is growing more crowded all the time.
McCarthy and Zald (1977) conceptualize resource mobilization theory as a way to explain
movement success in terms of its ability to acquire resources and mobilize individuals. For example,
PETA, a social movement organization, is in competition with Greenpeace and the Animal Liberation
Front (ALF), two other social movement organizations. Taken together, along with all other social
movement organizations working on animals rights issues, these similar organizations constitute a
social movement industry. Multiple social movement industries in a society, though they may have
widely different constituencies and goals, constitute a society's social movement sector. Every social
movement organization (a single social movement group) within the social movement sector is
competing for your attention, your time, and your resources. The chart below shows the relationship
between these components.

Figure 21.9 Multiple social movement organizations concerned about the same issue form a social movement industry. A
society’s many social movement industries comprise its social movement sector. With so many options, who will you give your
time or money to?

Framing/Frame Analysis
Over the past several decades, sociologists have developed the concept of frames to explain how
individuals identify and understand social events and which norms they should follow in any given
situation (Goffman 1974; Snow et al. 1986; Benford and Snow 2000). Imagine entering a restaurant.
Your “frame” immediately provides you with a behavior template. It probably does not occur to you to
wear pajamas to a fine dining establishment, throw food at other patrons, or spit your drink onto the
table. However, eating food at a sleepover pizza party provides you with an entirely different behavior
template. It might be perfectly acceptable to eat in your pajamas, and maybe even throw popcorn at
others or guzzle drinks from cans.
Successful social movements use three kinds of frames (Snow and Benford 1988) to further their
goals. The first type, diagnostic framing, states the problem in a clear, easily understood way. When
applying diagnostic frames, there are no shades of gray: instead, there is the belief that what “they” do
is wrong and this is how “we” will fix it. The anti-gay marriage movement is an example of diagnostic
framing with its uncompromising insistence that marriage is only between a man and a woman.
Prognostic framing, the second type, offers a solution and states how it will be implemented. Some
examples of this frame, when looking at the issue of marriage equality as framed by the anti-gay

CHAPTER 21 | SOCIAL MOVEMENTS AND SOCIAL CHANGE

marriage movement, include the plan to restrict marriage to “one man/one woman” or to allow only
“civil unions” instead of marriage. As you can see, there may be many competing prognostic frames
even within social movements adhering to similar diagnostic frames. Finally, motivational framing is
the call to action: what should you do once you agree with the diagnostic frame and believe in the
prognostic frame? These frames are action-oriented. In the gay marriage movement, a call to action
might encourage you to vote “no” on Proposition 8 in California (a move to limit marriage to malefemale couples), or conversely, to contact your local congressperson to express your viewpoint that
marriage should be restricted to opposite-sex couples.
With so many similar diagnostic frames, some groups find it best to join together to maximize
their impact. When social movements link their goals to the goals of other social movements and merge
into a single group, a frame alignment process (Snow et al. 1986) occurs—an ongoing and intentional
means of recruiting participants to the movement.
This frame alignment process involves four aspects: bridging, amplification, extension, and
transformation. Bridging describes a “bridge” that connects uninvolved individuals and unorganized or
ineffective groups with social movements that, though structurally unconnected, nonetheless share
similar interests or goals. These organizations join together creating a new, stronger social movement
organization. Can you think of examples of different organizations with a similar goal that have banded
together?
In the amplification model, organizations seek to expand their core ideas to gain a wider, more
universal appeal. By expanding their ideas to include a broader range, they can mobilize more people
for their cause. For example, the Slow Food movement extends its arguments in support of local food to
encompass reduced energy consumption and reduced pollution, plus reduced obesity from eating more
healthfully, and other benefits.
In extension, social movements agree to mutually promote each other, even when the two social
movement organization’s goals don’t necessarily relate to each other’s immediate goals. This often
occurs when organizations are sympathetic to each others’ causes, even if they are not directly aligned,
such as women’s equal rights and the civil rights movement.

LGBT advocacy are all human rights issues. (Photos (a) and (b) courtesy of Wikimedia Commons; Photo (c) courtesy of Charlie
Nguyen/flickr)

Transformation involves a complete revision of goals. Once a movement has succeeded, it risks
losing relevance. If it wants to remain active, the movement has to change with the transformation or
risk becoming obsolete. For instance, when the women’s suffrage movement gained women the right to
vote, they turned their attention to equal rights and campaigning to elect women. In short, it is an
evolution to the existing diagnostic or prognostic frames generally involving a total conversion of
movement.
New Social Movement Theory
New social movement theory, a development of European social scientists in the 1950s and 1960s,
attempts to explain the proliferation of post-industrial and post-modern movements that are difficult to
analyze using traditional social movement theories. Rather than being one specific theory, it is more of
a perspective that revolves around understanding movements as they relate to politics, identity, culture,
and social change. Some of these more complex interrelated movements include ecofeminism, which
focuses on the patriarchal society as the source of environmental problems, and the transgender rights
movement. Sociologist Steven Buechler (2000) suggests that we should be looking at the bigger picture
in which these movements arise—shifting to a macro-level, global analysis of social movements.

CHAPTER 21 | SOCIAL MOVEMENTS AND SOCIAL CHANGE

21.3 Social Change
Collective behavior and social movements are just two of the forces driving social change, which is the
change in society created through social movements as well as external factors like environmental shifts
or technological innovations. Essentially, any disruptive shift in the status quo, be it intentional or
random, human-caused or natural, can lead to social change. Below are some of the likely causes.

Causes of Social Change
Changes to technology, social institutions, population, and the environment, alone or in some
combination, create change. Below, we will discuss how these act as agents of social change and we’ll
examine real-world examples. We will focus on four agents of change recognized by social scientists:
technology, social institutions, population, and the environment.
Technology
Some would say that improving technology has made our lives easier. Imagine what your day would be
like without the internet, the automobile, or electricity. In The World Is Flat, Thomas Friedman (2005)
argues that technology is a driving force behind globalization, while the other forces of social change
(social institutions, population, environment) play comparatively minor roles. He suggests that we can
view globalization as occurring in three distinct periods. First, globalization was driven by military
expansion, powered by horsepower and windpower. The countries best able to take advantage of these
power sources expanded the most, exerting control over the politics of the globe from the late 15th
century to around the year 1800. The second shorter period, from approximately 1800 C.E. to 2000
C.E., consisted of a globalizing economy. Steam and rail power were the guiding forces of social
change and globalization in this period. Finally, Friedman brings us to the post-millennial era. In this
period of globalization, change is driven by technology, particularly the internet (Friedman 2005).
But also consider that technology can create change in the other three forces social scientists link
to social change. Advances in medical technology allow otherwise infertile women to bear children,
indirectly leading to an increase in population. Advances in agricultural technology have allowed us to
genetically alter and patent food products, changing our environment in innumerable ways. From the
way we educate children in the classroom to the way we grow the food we eat, technology has impacted
all aspects of modern life.
Of course there are drawbacks. The increasing gap between the technological haves and havenots––sometimes called the digital divide––occurs both locally and globally. Further, there are added
security risks: the loss of privacy, the risk of total system failure (like the Y2K panic at the turn of the
millennium), and the added vulnerability created by technological dependence. Think about the
technology that goes into keeping nuclear power plants running safely and securely. What happens if an
earthquake or other disaster, like in the case of Japan’s Fukushima plant, causes the technology to
malfunction, not to mention the possibility of a systematic attack to our nation’s relatively vulnerable
technological infrastructure?
Social Institutions
Each change in a single social institution leads to changes in all social institutions. For example, the
industrialization of society meant that there was no longer a need for large families to produce enough
manual labor to run a farm. Further, new job opportunities were in close proximity to urban centers
where living space was at a premium. The result is that the average family size shrunk significantly.
This same shift towards industrial corporate entities also changed the way we view government
involvement in the private sector, created the global economy, provided new political platforms, and
even spurred new religions and new forms of religious worship like Scientology. It has also informed
the way we educate our children: originally schools were set up to accommodate an agricultural
calendar so children could be home to work the fields in the summer, and even today, teaching models
are largely based on preparing students for industrial jobs, despite that being an outdated need. As this
example illustrates, a shift in one area, such as industrialization, means an interconnected impact across
social institutions.
Population
Population composition is changing at every level of society. Births increase in one nation and decrease
in another. Some families delay childbirth while others start bringing children into their fold early.
Population changes can be due to random external forces, like an epidemic, or shifts in other social

489

490

CHAPTER 21 | SOCIAL MOVEMENTS AND SOCIAL CHANGE

institutions, as described above. But regardless of why and how it happens, population trends have a
tremendous interrelated impact on all other aspects of society.
In the United States, we are experiencing an increase in our senior population as baby boomers
begin to retire, which will in turn change the way many of our social institutions are organized. For
example, there is an increased demand for housing in warmer climates, a massive shift in the need for
elder care and assisted living facilities, and growing awareness of elder abuse. There is concern about
labor shortages as boomers retire, not to mention the knowledge gap as the most senior and
accomplished leaders in different sectors start to leave. Further, as this large generation leaves the
workforce, the loss of tax income and pressure on pension and retirement plans means that the financial
stability of the country is threatened.
Globally, often the countries with the highest fertility rates are least able to absorb and attend to
the needs of a growing population. Family planning is a large step in ensuring that families are not
burdened with more children than they can care for. On a macro level, the increased population,
particularly in the poorest parts of the globe, also leads to increased stress on the planet’s resources.
The Environment
Turning to human ecology, we know that individuals and the environment affect each other. As human
populations move into more vulnerable areas, we see an increase in the number of people affected by
natural disasters, and we see that human interaction with the environment increases the impact of those
disasters. Part of this is simply the numbers: the more people there are on the planet, the more likely it
is that people will be impacted by a natural disaster.
But it goes beyond that. We face a combination of too many people and the increased demands
these numbers make on the earth. As a population, we have brought water tables to dangerously low
levels, built up fragile shorelines to increase development, and irrigated massive crop fields with water
brought in from several states away. How can we be surprised when homes along coastlines are battered
and droughts threaten whole towns? The year 2011 holds the unwelcome distinction of being a record
year for billion-dollar weather disasters, with about a dozen falling into that category. From twisters and
floods to snowstorms and droughts, the planet is making our problems abundantly clear (CBS News
2011). These events have birthed social movements and are bringing about social change as the public
becomes educated about these issues.

Our Dystopian Future: From A Brave New
World to The Hunger Games

Figure 21.11 Is the glass half-empty or half-full when it comes to social change? Fiction writers explore both sides
of the issue through fantasy futuristic novels like the Hunger Games trilogy by Suzanne Collins. (Photo courtesy of
Carissa Rogers/flickr)

Humans have long been interested in science fiction and space travel, and many of us are eager to
see the invention of jet packs and flying cars. But part of this futuristic fiction trend is much darker
and less optimistic. In 1932, when Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World was published, there was a
cultural trend towards seeing the future as golden and full of opportunity. In his novel set in 2540,
there is a more frightening future. Since then, there has been an ongoing stream of dystopian
novels, or books set in the future after some kind of apocalypse has occurred and when a
totalitarian and restrictive government has taken over. These books have been gaining in

CHAPTER 21 | SOCIAL MOVEMENTS AND SOCIAL CHANGE

popularity recently, especially among young adult readers. And while the adult versions of these
books often have a grim or dismal ending, the youth-geared versions usually end with some
promise of hope.
So what is it about our modern times that makes looking forward so fearsome? Take the
example of author Suzanne Collins’s hugely popular Hunger Games trilogy for young adults. The
futuristic setting isn’t given a date, and the locale is Panem, a transformed version of North
America with 12 districts ruled by a cruel and dictatorial capitol. The capitol punishes the districts
for their long-ago attempt at rebellion by forcing an annual Hunger Game, where two children
from each district are thrown into a created world where they must fight to the death. Connotations
of gladiator games and video games come together in this world, where the government can kill
people for their amusement, and the technological wonders never cease. From meals that appear at
the touch of a button to mutated government-built creatures that track and kill, the future world of
Hunger Games is a mix of modernization fantasy and nightmare.
When thinking about modernization theory and how it is viewed today by both functionalists
and conflict theorists, it is interesting to look at this world of fiction that is so popular. When you
think of the future, do you view it as a wonderful place, full of opportunity? Or as a horrifying
dictatorship sublimating the individual to the good of the state? Do you view modernization as
something to look forward to or something to avoid? And which media has influenced your view?

Modernization
Modernization describes the processes that increase the amount of specialization and differentiation of
structure in societies resulting in the move from an undeveloped society to developed, technologically
driven society (Irwin 1975). By this definition, the level of modernity within a society is judged by the
sophistication of its technology, particularly as it relates to infrastructure, industry, and the like.
However, it is important to note the inherent ethnocentric bias of such assessment. Why do we assume
that those living in semi-peripheral and peripheral nations would find it so wonderful to become more
like the core nations? Is modernization always positive?
One contradiction of all kinds of technology is that they often promise time-saving benefits, but
somehow fail to deliver. How many times have you ground your teeth in frustration at an internet site
that refused to load or at a dropped call on your cell phone? Despite time-saving devices such as
dishwashers, washing machines, and, now, remote control vacuum cleaners, the average amount of time
spent on housework is the same today as it was fifty years ago. And the dubious benefits of 24/7 email
and immediate information have simply increased the amount of time employees are expected to be
responsive and available. While once businesses had to travel at the speed of the United States postal
system, sending something off and waiting until it was received before the next stage, today the
immediacy of information transfer means there are no such breaks.
Further, the internet bought us information, but at a cost. The morass of information means that
there is as much poor information available as trustworthy sources. There is a delicate line to walk
when core nations seek to bring the assumed benefits of modernization to more traditional cultures. For
one, there are obvious pro-capitalist biases that go into such attempts, and it is short-sighted for western
governments and social scientists to assume all other countries aspire to follow in their footsteps.
Additionally, there can be a kind of neo-liberal defense of rural cultures, ignoring the often crushing
poverty and diseases that exist in peripheral nations and focusing only on a nostalgic mythology of the
happy peasant. It takes a very careful hand to understand both the need for cultural identity and
preservation as well as the hopes for future growth.

CHAPTER 21 | SOCIAL MOVEMENTS AND SOCIAL CHANGE

Section Summary
21.1 Collective Behavior
Collective behavior is non-institutionalized activity in which several people voluntarily engage. There
are four different forms of collective behavior: crowd, mass, public, and social movement. There are
three main theories on collective behavior. The first, the emergent-norm perspective, emphasizes the
importance of social norms in crowd behavior. The next, the value-added theory, is a functionalist
perspective that states that several preconditions must be in place for collective behavior to occur.
Finally the assembling perspective focuses on collective action rather than collective behavior,
addressing the processes associated with crowd behavior and the lifecycle and various categories of
gatherings.

21.2 Social Movements
Social movements are purposeful, organized groups, either with the goal of pushing toward change,
giving political voice to those without it, or gathering for some other common purpose. Social
movements intersect with environmental changes, technological innovations, and other external factors
to create social change. There are a myriad of catalysts that create social movements, and the reasons
that people join are as varied as the participants themselves. Sociologists look at both the macro- and
microanalytical reasons that social movements occur, take root, and ultimately succeed or fail.

21.3 Social Change
There are numerous and varied causes of social change. Four common causes, as recognized by social
scientists, are technology, social institutions, population, and the environment. All four of these areas
can impact when and how society changes. And they are all interrelated: a change in one area can lead
to changes throughout. Modernization is a typical result of social change. Modernization refers to the
process of increased differentiation and specialization within a society, particularly around its industry
and infrastructure. While this assumes that more modern societies are better, there has been significant
pushback on this western-centric view that all peripheral and semi-peripheral countries should aspire to
be like North America and Western Europe.
