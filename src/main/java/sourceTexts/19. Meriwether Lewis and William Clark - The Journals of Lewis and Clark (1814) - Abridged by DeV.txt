Foreword
These journals are a national literary treasure. Lewis and Clark's exploration of the
western two thirds of the continent was our epic voyage, their account of it is our
epic poem. Sitting before the nightly campfire, using a quill pen that had to be dipped
into the inkwell every other word, balancing their leather-covered journals on their
knees, Captains Meriwether Lewis and William Clark described the day's events, as
well as the land and its people and its flora and fauna, in a prose remarkable for its
verve, sharp imagery, tension, and immediacy.
Reading the journals puts you in the canoe with them. You trek the Lolo Trail and
winter over in North Dakota and at the mouth of the Columbia River. You see the
country through their eyes. It unfolds before you the lower Missouri, the Great Bend,
the junction with the Yellowstone, the White Cliffs and the Missouri River Breaks, the
Great Falls, the Three Forks, Lemhi Pass, the Columbia Gorge, and on to the Pacific
with a vividness enhanced by the knowledge that you're seeing with the eyes of the
first literate men to view these sights. You and the captains are in a constant state of
surprise, because as you read, and as they write, you never know what's around the
bend of the river, or what will happen next.
What they experienced, we cannot, because there is no unexplored continent left. No
matter where we go, we know about the country in advance from pictures, maps,
and books about it. Yet it is one of the glories of the Lewis and Clark story that we
can visit their campgrounds and still see what they saw. Their adventure is
accessible in a way that Columbus's voyage or Admiral Byrd's flights over the Poles
or the experiences of the other great explorers are not. In the Dakotas, Montana,

Page viii
Idaho, Washington, and Oregon, large stretches of the Lewis and Clark Trail remain
pristine or nearly so. For me there is no greater joy than sitting around the fire at a
Lewis and Clark campsite, after a day of hiking in their footsteps or canoeing in their
wake, reading aloud from their journals their accounts of what happened to them on
the day they were there, getting the circle around the fire to lean forward just a bit,
so as not to miss a word.
Books have the power to change our lives. The journals of Lewis and Clark changed
mine. I first read the journals in 1975; since then I've been traveling the trail, with
my family, every summer. Over the past two decades we've spent at least a few
days each year on the Missouri River, often with friends, in groups ranging in size
from five to fifty, with ages running from three to sixty-five. In addition, we've each
year hiked or gone by horseback over a part of the Lolo Trail in Idaho, and on the
Fourth of July have camped at Lemhi Pass, where Lewis was the first American to
cross the Continental Divide. So hooked did the kids become on Montana that three
of the five of them went to college there, then made the state their home. So hooked
did my wife and I become that we now live half the year in Helena. All because of the
journals.
Whenever my family were together on the river or the trail, we ended the day by
taking turns reading the captains' words aloud. Lewis and Clark delighted our ears
with their run-on sentences they are as good at this style as William Faulkner or
Gertrude Stein. They delighted our eyes with their idiosyncratic spelling: Captain
Clark has twenty-six different ways to spell the word "Sioux," none of them the
modern one. For all of us, puzzling out the words and punctuating the run-on
sentences were at first a bit daunting, but we soon got the hang of it, pulled along as
we were by the sheer pace of the action. The captains go determinedly from
challenge to triumph, from danger to near-disaster, from their base camp on the
lower Missouri to where the Columbia meets the Pacific and the moment, a year and
a half after starting out, that Clark writes the immortal line "Ocian in view! O! the
joy!"
Beyond the immediacy of the writing, what makes the journals such great fun to
read is their range and breadth and colorful cast of characters. Sacajawea, the
teen-aged Indian guide; Charbonneau, her French Canadian husband; Pomp, their
infant son; York, the slave of Captain Clark; Drewyer, the interpreter and
woodsman; and the twenty-eight recruits, the men of the Corps of Discovery,
among them Colter, who left the party to become a mountain man, and Floyd, who
died on the trail

Page ix
each is caught in a journal entry, a sort of prose snapshot that brings him or her to
life.
The Indian characters too are fascinating: Cameâhwait of the Shoshones, Big White
of the Mandans, Comowool of the Clatsops, Black Buffalo of the Sioux, Old Toby of
the Shoshones, Broken Arm of the Nez Percés. Lewis and Clark record their
conversations (always by sign language), their customs, dress, economy, politics,
and individual quirks. These passages on Native Americans some, like the Shoshones
and the Nez Percés, Indians never before encountered by white men are an
invaluable contribution to our ethnography as well as our literature.
The principal characters are, of course, the captains. On virtually every page they
reveal something of their personalities. Lewis gets angry and snaps at one of the
men; Clark sees Charbonneau strike his wife and upbraids him severely; the Sioux
challenge the expedition and Clark feels himself grow warm with indignation and
determination not to be bullied; Lewis sees the Rocky Mountains and is overjoyed.
They complemented each other as explorers Lewis was the better botanist, Clark the
better boatsman, Lewis the better zoologist, Clark the better cartographer and they
complement each other as writers. Clark could be lyrical, but more often was a stickto-the-point, no-wasted words kind of writer. Lewis was more introspective (most
especially in his August 18 1805 thoughts on his thirty-first birthday), more likely to
share his worries and hopes.
Recording and sharing: that is the essence of Lewis and Clark's journals. You are
with them as they discover new animals, plants, fish, Indian tribes. You get the first
descriptions of dozens of previously unknown birds, and the first attempt to
transcribe the song of the western meadowlark. And you are present for the greatest
hunting experiences any man ever had. When Lewis, at the Great Falls, writes that
he had just seen the biggest buffalo herd he had ever seen, that means it was the
biggest herd any white man ever saw. Botanists, zoologists, cartographers,
ethnologists, soldiers, medical historians there is something here for each to savor.
For one hundred years after they were written, the journals remained unpublished.
This was Meriwether Lewis's fault. After returning to Washington in November 1806,
Lewis promised Thomas Jefferson,

Page x
almost a father to him, and William Clark, the best friend a man ever had, that he
would prepare the journals for publication, but he always found a way to put off the
work. His was the greatest writer's block of all time, as a fortune was awaiting him
upon publication, so high was the interest in the United States and Europe about his
discoveries. When he died of his own hand in 1809, he had not prepared a single line
for the printer.
Clark asked Jefferson to edit the journals, but Jefferson demurred he had retired and
was devoting his time to Monticello and the University of Virginia. Clark felt diffident
about his own skills and so sought a professional for the work. Eventually he found
Nicholas Biddle of Philadelphia, who agreed to take on the task. In 1815 Biddle
published a narrative account of the expedition, based on the journals and
completely true to the original, but still a paraphrase. Not until 1904 did a complete
edition of the journals appear. It was edited by Reuben Gold Thwaites of the
Wisconsin State Historical Society, and appeared in eight volumes, published by
Dodd, Mead & Company. For the first time, the world got to see what the captains
wrote.
But eight volumes are a staggering sight to any reader other than a Lewis and Clark
scholar. It was not until 1953, a century and a half after they were written, that the
journals became available to a large public. That year, Houghton Mifflin Company
brought out Bernard DeVoto's one-volume condensation of the journals. Since then
it has been continuously in print, and read by hundreds of thousands. The success is
well earned. It is a superb work.
DeVoto was one of the literary lions of his day, at the top rank of American writers as
an essayist, a novelist, a curmudgeon, a pundit, a reviewer, an editor, a Mark Twain
scholar, and more. He was beloved by a remarkable range of fellow authors, so large
they called themselves "The Tribe of Benny." Wallace Stegner was a friend and fan
who wrote DeVoto's biography and edited a volume of his letters. He and Catherine
Drinker Bowen, Edith Mirrielees, and Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., contributed recollections
of him to a volume published shortly after DeVoto's death. For any writer of history
or Americana, a memorial as heartfelt as Four Portraits and One Subject is the
greatest honor one could wish for.
Born in the West in Ogden, Utah in 1897, DeVoto came east to Boston, where he
spoke for his native soil through his column, "The

Page xi
Easy Chair," in Harper's Magazine. He had been a doughboy in World War I; during
World War II he devoted himself almost completely to writing the history of the
West. His trilogy The Year of Decision (1943), Across the Wide Missouri (1947), and
The Course of Empire (1952) is magnificent in its sweep and scope, and is still read
today. It was the perfect literary accompaniment to the war and postwar years.
DeVoto's account of early-nineteenth-century America is triumphant; it depicts a
nation full of hubris and genuine accomplishment, bold, forward-looking, dynamic,
on the march. It has a moral certainty to it that was appropriate to the generation
that had overcome the Depression, defeated Hitler, Tojo, and Mussolini, turned back
the Communists in Korea, and held back the Red Army along the Iron Curtain. In
DeVoto's narrative summary of the Lewis and Clark story, the centerpiece of The
Course of Empire, the captains never appease potential enemies but face them
down. After completing the trilogy, DeVoto couldn't let go of Lewis and Clark, and
put in a year editing the journals.
It is his great work. He opens with a disclaimer: "This condensation of the Lewis and
Clark journals cannot be used instead of the original edition for purposes of
scholarship." He was right. But he was even more right when he added, "It has been
edited for the general reader." In the original edition, Thwaites included everything
the captains wrote. Much of it is repetitious, as Clark often copied out Lewis's journal
as insurance against its loss. Much of it is too detailed for anyone but a professional
naturalist long, painstaking descriptions of birds, plants, animals. What you get from
DeVoto is the heart of the story, without sacrificing any of the narrative or much of
the natural history. As Catherine Drinker Bowen said, "It is the best kind of historical
reading, notes and all.''
DeVoto was not a cloistered scholar. He got out on the trail, by canoe, by foot, on
horseback. He traveled where the captains did, saw what they saw, and argued for
the conservation of their world. One of his favorite sites was on the Lolo Trail in
Idaho, just over the Continental Divide at Lolo Pass, along today's U.S. Highway 12,
in a magnificent grove of giant cedars beside the fast-flowing Lochsa River. There he
liked to pitch his tent and think about the captains. There, on an early spring day in
1956, his ashes were scattered. The site today is marked by the state of Idaho as
the Bernard DeVoto Grove and is maintained as it was when Lewis and Clark came
through. It is an altogether fitting tribute.

Page xii
Since 1953, a great deal has been written about the Lewis and Clark expedition. To
the list of supplementary reading that DeVoto appends to his Preface, I would like to
add the following later works: Meriwether Lewis: A Biography, by Richard Dillon
(New York, 1965); Letters of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, 17831854, edited by
Donald Jackson (Urbana, Ill., 1962; 2nd ed., 1978); Lewis and Clark among the
Indians, by James Ronda (Lincoln, Neb., 1984); and my own Undaunted Courage:
Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West (New
York, 1996). There are also scores of outstanding articles in We Proceeded On, the
quarterly journal of the Lewis and Clark Trail Heritage Foundation (Great Falls, Mont.,
from 1974). Best of all, there is the new, eight-volume edition of the journals, edited
by Gary E. Moulton (Lincoln, Neb., 1986-1993), and its five-volume supplement of
related documents (in progress). Together they include much previously uncollected
material, including Lewis's journal of his trip down the Ohio in 1803, and innumerable
fascinating footnotes, with a special emphasis on botany and other scientific
subjects.
For the scholar, Moulton's is the definitive edition. For the rest of us, it complements
but does not supersede the present volume. DeVoto's condensation is in its own way
definitive. It is the ideal selection for the citizen-reader, an American classic in its
own right, a book that will be read as long as the Republic lasts.

Preface
This condensation of the Lewis and Clark journals cannot be used instead of the
original edition for the purposes of scholarship. It has been edited for the general
reader. Many entries of the original have been omitted. Of those printed here,
perhaps three-quarters have been shortened, many of them considerably shortened.
My edition is based on the first one, Original Journals of the Lewis and Clark
Expedition, edited by Reuben Gold Thwaites. By the kindness of Dodd, Mead &
Company I have been able to regard that edition as a unit and to use whatever I
might choose to of Thwaites's editorial work as well as the text of the journals.
The Thwaites edition, published in 19045, runs to seven volumes of text and a
volume of maps. (There was also a more expensive edition from the same plates, in
which the seven volumes of text were divided to make fourteen.) The journals
themselves fill five of the seven volumes; typography and format are such that the
five are equivalent to three books the size of this one. I reproduce here, then, about
one-third of the original rather more than half of the daily log.
It is generally agreed that the journals are an American classic, and certainly they
are by far the most interesting as well as the most important original narrative of
North American exploration. Nevertheless, few people have read them. The rarity
and cost of the Thwaites edition help to account for this regrettable fact, but it is due
primarily to the presence in the text of much material essential to the purposes of
the expedition but unrelated to the running narrative and a considerable drag on it. I
have made this

Page xiv
condensation, which omits most of the accessory material, in the hope that by
means of it a great book will find a wider public than it has had.
I believe that the narrative is retained intact here, except for Clark's journey in 1806
from Traveller's Rest to the mouth of the Yellowstone River. (For which, since it
contains nothing of outstanding importance, I have substituted the summary
account in my book, The Course of Empire.) That is, I have omitted no important
event and no incident of more than passing interest. I have included as much as
seemed possible of the daily routine and the continuous direct observation of the
new country the expedition was traveling. I have also included representative
descriptions of the flora and fauna and all important descriptions of Indian life,
omitting anthropological details.
As originally printed, the Journals include the courses of the rivers traveled every
day, except on the return journeys, and sometimes the courses or bearings of the
land traverse. In the notebooks a few of these were entered with the daily log at the
end of the proper entry, transferred there from the field books in which they were
recorded; more often, Thwaites himself transferred them from the field books. I have
omitted all these and all astronomical observations and tabulations of temperature
and weather. I have omitted most of the detailed scientific descriptions of animals
and plants that were made for the eventual use of Jefferson's scientific
correspondents, especially Benjamin Smith Barton. Finally, there are some stretches
where Thwaites prints both first and final drafts of daily entries and much longer
stretches from the Mandan villages to the Three Forks, down the Columbia, at Fort
Clatsop, the return up the Columbia where entries by both Lewis and Clark cover the
same day and the same action, with Clark frequently copying parts of Lewis's entry
verbatim. In such places I have reprinted only one draft, usually the final one, and
the entry that seemed to me the more interesting or revealing.
This accounts for considerably more than half of the material I have omitted; the
remaining deletions are from the text of the daily log. The original has at least one
entry for every day the expedition was in the field. I have omitted some days
entirely, most freely in the sections between Wood River and the Platte on the
upstream journey, at the Great Falls portage, and during

Page xv
the winter at Fort Clatsop. For the rest my deletions consist of paragraphs,
consecutive sentences, or at least whole sentences, but I have not hesitated to omit
parts of a sentence at times, to preserve continuity or insure clarity.
I have been unable to devise any satisfactory means of indicating these omissions,
and I am convinced that none is necessary or even desirable. I have undertaken to
produce a straightforward text which could be read without distraction and as if it
were the original account, one to which a reader without a specialist's interests need
not bring a specialist's preparation. I repeat, therefore, that this edition cannot be
used as a substitute for the full version of the journals. Anyone who wants all the
data, full information, or assurance that on any given point he has read everything
the captains wrote must go to the original.
The nature of the text itself was something else. My job was clearly to preserve
Lewis and Clark, not to approximate Nicholas Biddle's History. The spellings of the
original are a large part of its charm, and I have not changed them at all. For the
most part too I have retained the original punctuation; occasionally a deletion I have
made has required me to insert or delete or change a mark of punctuation in order to
retain the sense. I have omitted a number of irrelevant or inexplicable quotation
marks and miscellaneous symbols or abbreviations whose reference is to deleted
passages of observation or description. I have repeatedly indented paragraphs,
especially in entries by Lewis, where none are set off in the original. I have
occasionally inserted commas where there are none in the text and have capitalized
a few words which the original prints without initial capitals. Also in two important
passages, both by Lewis, who was the more long-winded of the captains, I have set
off as separate sentences elements of long discourses that in the original are pinned
together by semicolons. No doubt the reader will wish that I had taken such liberties
in several other passages.
A word about parenthetical material is called for. When Thwaites published the
journals, he was obliged to reproduce them exactly and to supply editorial
emendations. He indicated missing letters and words by printing them in brackets; I
have retained almost all such emendations. He also inserted in brackets explanatory
material of his own, printing it in roman type. I have deleted

Page xvi
some of these interpolations, substituted my own bracketed explanations for others,
and kept his without acknowledgment where I saw fit to. Thwaites also had to
account for interlineations in the manuscripts, many of which were in the handwriting
of Nicholas Biddle. When Biddle wrote the account of the expedition that has
remained standard ever since,1 he had the manuscripts, which Clark had turned over
to him, and he also had at hand George Shannon, one of the most intelligent
members of the party, whom Clark, the surviving principal, sent to him to provide
amplification and eyewitness explanation. Thwaites italicized and enclosed in
parentheses additions to the manuscript in Biddle's writing (usually the result of
Shannon's explanations) and evidently, though he does not say so, some by
Shannon. I have retained many of them; since there was no need to identify them, I
have not italicized some that read like natural parentheses by the original writer.
Thwaites italicized and enclosed in brackets similar emendations in the handwriting
of Clark, Elliott Coues, who in 1893 edited a famous edition of Biddle, or others
whom he could not identify, but I have retained only a few of them. All the footnotes
are mine; I have used none of Thwaites's.
The entry as it appears here has almost always been written up from notes jotted in
field books and from other notebooks reserved for courses, bearings, celestial
observations, and related data. Evidently most of them were written in the evening
of the day whose date they bear but some are several days later than the events
they record. Some written at Fort Mandan, the Great Falls, Bitterroot Valley, and the
Clearwater, and many written at Fort Clatsop, turn back to much earlier events and
observations. In several places where Thwaites has added material not part of a daily
entry but obviously belonging with it, I have not interrupted the continuity in order to
notify the reader, though of course Thwaites does.2
Whether Lewis kept separate journals during the periods for
1History of the Expedition Under the Command of Captains Lewis and Clark
(Philadelphia, 1814).
2 Coues, who examined the manuscript material and reported on it to the
American Philosophical Society, believed that the finished log, the journals as we
know them, were not written till after the return to St. Louis. (Thwaites, VII,
422.) He appears to have been wrong and Jefferson's testimony to the contrary
(ibid., 394) must be accepted as conclusive.

Page xvii
which only those by Clark survive is not known, except in the period following the
reuniting of all the parties below the mouth of the Yellowstone on the return journey,
when he tells us that he did not. On the upstream journey to the Mandan villages and
during the winter at Fort Mandan, the daily record is a log kept mainly by Clark but
with occasional entries by Lewis. In this period the text occasionally suggests that
Lewis was keeping a separate journal of his own, but if he did none has ever been
found.
In several passages I have interpolated entries from the journal of Private Joseph
Whitehouse, which is printed in Volume VII of Thwaites, and from that of Sergeant
John Ordway. Biddle made use of both when writing his History but Ordway's had
disappeared from view when Thwaites prepared his edition. It was later discovered
among Biddle's private papers and, edited by Milo M. Quaife, was published in the
Collections of the State Historical Society of Wisconsin for 1916. I have also used
several passages from Biddle, taking them from the first edition, not Coues's
reprint.3
I have used only one entry from Sergeant Floyd's brief journal, which is printed in
Thwaites, Volume VII, and only a few from Sergeant Gass's. The latter was put into
elegant English by a West Virginia schoolmaster and published in 1807, less than a
year after the return of the expedition, seven years before Biddle's History. The
earliest authentic account, it became very popular and has been reprinted many
times, but though most useful to scholars it is wooden and lifeless. Presumably
several other members of the party kept journals; the sergeants were ordered and
the enlisted men urged to keep them. If Pryor, the remaining sergeant, kept one, no
one has ever found it, and we know of only one private besides Whitehouse who did,
Robert Frazier. A manuscript prospectus announcing the forthcoming publication of
his journal survives, but there is no evidence that it was published, nor has the
manuscript been found.
For reference and supplementary reading I suggest John Bakeless, Lewis & Clark
(New York, 1947), Elijah H. Criswell, Lewis
3 We have had no greater editor than Coues but it is well known that he had a
highhanded way with texts, altering them as he saw fit. Even in the brief
passages I use, his edition makes changes in spelling, grammar, and wording.

Page xviii
and Clark: Linguistic Pioneers (Columbia, Mo., 1940), Bernard DeVoto, The Course
of Empire (Boston, 1952), Olin D. Wheeler, The Trail of Lewis and Clark (New York,
1904). Coues's edition of Biddle is incomparably the best one and the footnotes and
other editorial matter are indispensable to students. Note, however, that much has
been learned since Coues and Thwaites and that some of their notes, more of
Thwaites's than of Coues's, are in error.

Introduction
Toward the end of November 1802, President Thomas Jefferson asked the Spanish
minister a carefully unofficial question. Would the Spanish court ''take it badly,'' he
inquired, if the United States should send a small expedition to "explore the course of
the Missouri River," which lay wholly in the still Spanish territory of Louisiana? The
ostensible reason for such an expedition, he went on, would be the advancement of
commerce, since Congress had no power to appropriate money for its real object.
But "in reality it would have no other view than the advancement of the geography."
Louisiana would not continue to be Spanish much longer; it was to be returned to
French sovereignty under the Treaty of San Ildefonso, which had been signed in
October 1800. But since the transfer had not yet been made, the duty of the
minister, the Marqués de Casa Yrujo, was to protect the interests of Spain. He and
the Spanish officials in New Orleans and St. Louis had long been afraid of American
expansion in Louisiana, and of American and British military expeditions against New
Mexico by way of Louisiana. He therefore, with the same scrupulous informality, told
the President that "I persuaded myself that an expedition of this nature could not fail
to give umbrage to our Government."
"Then he replied to me," Yrujo wrote to his chief, the Commandant of the Interior
Provinces at Madrid, "that he did not see the motive why they [the Spanish
government] should have the least fear, inasmuch as its object would not be other
than to observe the territories which are found between 40° and 60° from the mouth
of the Missouri to the Pacific Ocean, and unite the dis-

Page xxiv
coveries these men would make with those which the celebrated Makensi [Alexander
Mackenzie] made in 1793, and be sure if it were possible in that district to establish a
continual communication, or little interrupted, by water as far as the South Sea."
Yrujo asserted that there was no need to inquire into this question further than had
already been done. He summarized findings of various French, Spanish, Canadian,
British, and imaginary explorers in the region proposed. They had demonstrated, he
said, that the long sought Northwest Passage did not exist, that "a considerable
cordillera" existed between 50° and 60°, that "a very great distance" must be
traversed by land, and that Indian tribes had not been able to inform Mackenzie of
''any considerable river whatsoever" that flowed from the mountains to the Pacific. In
the interest of Spain Yrujo was being a good deal more positive than the state of
knowledge justified, was inventing information which no one had, and was actually
contradicting some things Mackenzie had said in his book all of which, of course,
Jefferson recognized. But, Yrujo said, "this account of the useless and fruitless
attempts, it seems to me calmed his spirit with which he began to talk to me of the
subject."
Yrujo had some but not much hope that this would be the end of the proposed
expedition. Asking for instructions about it, he ended his dispatch with a comment
on Jefferson which expressed the prevailing view of him and his country in the
diplomatic corps at Washington. "The President has been all his life a man of letters,
very speculative and a lover of glory, and it would be possible he might attempt to
perpetuate the fame of his administration not only by the measures of frugality and
economy which characterize him, but also by discovering or at least attempting to
discover the way by which the Americans may some day extend their population and
their influence up to the coasts of the South Sea." He did not need to point out to the
colonial minister that the most promising "way" was the one Jefferson had
mentioned, the Missouri River, since for ten years the Spanish themselves had been
trying to reach the Pacific by ascending it.1

This dispatch of Yrujo's was dated December 2 1802. Two months later, on January
31 1803, he reported that Jefferson "has communicated his design to the Senate,
which has already taken a step toward the execution." He understood, however, that
the "good judgment of the Senate" could not see in the proposed expedition such
advantages as the President claimed for it and was, besides, afraid that "it might
offend one of the European nations." Probably therefore, Yrujo concluded, ''the
project will not proceed."2
Modern techniques for leaking to the press the secret proceedings of the Congress of
the United States had not yet been developed. Jefferson had sent a secret message
to Congress embodying his proposal, on January 18 1803. It had been considered in
committees of the whole. The appropriation asked for had promptly been passed by
the House and concurred in by the Senate. Thirteen days later a minister is ignorant
of the message's content and the action taken on it.
In the message of January 18 Jefferson reversed what he had said to Yrujo. He
asked for an appropriation of $2500 to cover the cost of an expedition to ascend the
Missouri River to its source and to go on from there to the Pacific Ocean. He
suggested that it be made "for the purpose of extending the external commerce of
the United States," phraseology which was so general that as the title of a bill it
would attract no attention. He would, however, explain the expedition to Spain as "a
literary pursuit," that is, as solely an effort to add to geographical and scientific
knowledge.
The expedition would indeed accomplish that end but, the message said, its primary
purpose was to investigate a commercial opportunity of very great importance to the
United States. Certain Indian tribes who lived in the Missouri country were known to
"furnish great supplies of furs and peltry to the trade of another nation, carried on in
a high latitude through an infinite number of portages and lakes shut up by ice
through a long season." A route which would bring this trade down the Missouri to
its mouth and then across the United States would be so superior that the
established one could "bear no competition with it."
Jefferson went on to tell Congress that the Missouri was understood to traverse
country which had "a moderate climate"
2 Nasatir, II, 716.

Page xxvi
that is, the river did not freeze in winter, or at any rate not for long. It offered
"according to the best accounts continued navigation from its source" that is, there
would be no portages at all, as contrasted with the "infinite number" of the northern
route. Perhaps indeed, and this was exceedingly important, there need be only "a
single portage to the Western Ocean" that is, trade goods could be carried between
the Pacific and the Mississippi with only one transshipment. Then from the Mississippi
to American ports on the Atlantic there would be ''a choice of channels through the
Illinois or Wabash, the (Great) Lakes and Hudson, through the Ohio and
Susquehanna, or Potomac or James Rivers, and through the Tennessee and
Savannah rivers."3 The expedition which he desired to send out, the President said,
would explore this route and would conduct with the Indians negotiations
preparatory to securing to American citizens the trade he envisioned.
The nation he referred to but did not name was Canada, and the route he described
was the famous one by which the North West Company transported to Montreal the
wealth in beaver it acquired by trade with the Indians west, northwest, and north of
Lake Winnipeg. As many entries in the Lewis and Clark journals show, Jefferson
believed that by means of the Upper Missouri American traders and carriers could get
easy access to the highways of the Canadian fur trade, the Assiniboine,
Saskatchewan, and Athabaska
3 Jefferson was working out a transcontinental route for interoceanic trade,
which was the hope that had sustained nearly three centuries of search for the
Northwest Passage. He did not need to point out to Congress that some of the
routes east of the Mississippi which he named were almost continuous. The
one from the mouth of the Missouri to Lake Michigan by way of the Illinois
River was interrupted only by the short Chicago Portage; indeed, during the
flood season of some years this stretch could be paddled. After the Chicago
Portage to Lake Michigan there was no interruption all the way to Oswego on
Lake Ontario, and from Oswego a few easy portages led to the Mohawk River.
(With equal ease an alternative route led from Lake Erie to the Finger Lakes.
Note the relation of both these routes to that of the Erie Canal.) The Great
Lakes were not navigable during the winter, however, and a route up the Ohio
River would be far preferable though Jefferson did not say so to New York
congressmen. Such a route would necessitate a long interruption for the
difficult and costly crossing of the Pennsylvania mountains. Yet in 1803 it was a
reasonable expectation that various proposed canals would soon greatly
reduce this difficulty, or perhaps even overcome it. In 1802 the Potomac
Company, which Washington had helped to organize in 1785, had completed a
series of locks round the Great Falls of the Potomac. By 1808 additional locks
and short canals provided continuous passage to Harper's Ferry, and
eventually, as the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, the system extended to
Cumberland.

Rivers, and to the wealth in furs of the lands they drained. The expedition he now
proposed was to establish a basis for opening American trade with Indians along the
Missouri in Louisiana, a province still under Spanish rule though about to be
transferred to France. It was also to prepare an early and, so Jefferson believed,
very promising effort by American traders to invade, and perhaps eventually to
monopolize, the biggest business in Canada.
These were the principal declared purposes of the Lewis and Clark expedition. There
were undeclared purposes as well, which will presently be described here. Now,
however, it becomes expedient to glance at certain domestic and international
matters that were at a critical stage when Jefferson sent his secret message to
Congress.
2
The area called Louisiana was the western half of the drainage basin of the
Mississippi River, except such parts of it as were acknowledged to have been
Spanish before 1762.4 (Thus excluded is the region south of the Arkansas River,
west of the 100th meridian, and east of the Continental Divide.) According to the
generally accepted belief, the northern boundary of Louisiana had been established
by treaty at the 49th parallel. (Actually it had not been; there was a legal and
diplomatic hiatus which permitted the manipulation of many theories and
interpretations, one which might well have caused more confusion than in the
eventual negotiations with Canada it did.) Jefferson, however, believed that if any
portions of the Missouri drainage basin extended north of 49° they were part of
Louisiana, and this was in the forefront of his thinking in 1803. The western
boundary was the Continental Divide (which was still almost entirely a hypothetical
conception), though some people held that, south of 49° and north of the undefined
California,
4 The fact that the city and "Isle" of New Orleans were east of the Mississippi
confused thinking, and therefore negotiation, about the Louisiana Purchase
after it was made. Whether the United States had bought "the Isle of Orleans,"
or part or all of West Florida were questions which provided ample room for
honest and dishonest debate and later led to much turmoil, fraud, and even
insurrection. The legal question never was directly settled; it was extinguished
by the purchase of East Florida and the accompanying concession of West
Florida in the Adams-Onís Treaty, signed in 1819.

Page xxviii
Louisiana extended all the way to the Pacific. In 1803 Jefferson believed that at least
a faint claim to this far-western extension might exist.
Whatever the exact boundaries were, France had ceded Louisiana to Spain in 1762.
The cession had a twofold purpose: to win Spain's assent to a peace treaty following
the Seven Years' War by compensating her for losses suffered, and to make sure
that Great Britain could not acquire Louisiana as well as Canada at the peace
conference. Louisiana had therefore been a Spanish possession during the American
Revolution and the entire national existence of the United States down to 1800. In
October of that year Napoleon, as First Consul, forced Spain to "retrocede" it to
France. This cession was made by the Treaty of San Ildefonso, news of which
reached the United States in May 1801.
The acquisition of Louisiana was a step in Napoleon's effort to restore the French
Empire in North America. In continuation of that effort he assembled two armies.
One was sent to San Domingo in January 1802, to recover the island from the Negro
dictator Toussaint L'Ouverture. The other, equipped and mobilized with great
secrecy, was intended for Louisiana, which it was to secure against the British in the
inevitable war whose outbreak would not be long postponed. Also, when reinforced
by the one that would reconquer San Domingo, it was to be available for action
against Canada and to awe and if need be invade the United States. As early as April
1802 the State Department learned what its destination was to be.
It never sailed for Louisiana. The army in San Domingo did capture Toussaint but it
was wiped out by yellow fever. The regiments that had been mobilized for Louisiana
were sent instead to San Domingo, where they too were decimated by the fever and
the incessant guerrilla attrition of Toussaint's successors. That Napoleon's great
effort in the Western Hemisphere had failed was apparent to Jefferson when he
addressed Congress in January 1803, though the full extent of the failure would not
be understood till November. In that month the last remnants of the French army
surrendered to a blockading British fleet, in order to escape massacre by the blacks.
Spain's cession of Louisiana to France had created a situation of very great danger to
the United States. It established on our west-

Page xxix
ern boundary, instead of the weak and lethargic government of Spain, the greatest
military power that had ever existed, the expanding French Empire under the
dictatorship of the man who intended to conquer Europe and so master the world.
Unassisted, the United States would be unable to drive the French out except by a
total military effort that would require years, and there was little likelihood that under
the pressures of war the young republic could hold together for so long a time.
"From that moment," Jefferson, a lifelong anglophobe, wrote to our minister at Paris,
"from that moment we must marry ourselves to the British fleet and nation." So long
as France ruled Louisiana, our hope of safety lay in joint sea power.
That, however, was a long-term problem in foreign relations. The immediate urgency
created by the cession was a domestic crisis. The Spanish Intendant took advantage
of the impending transfer to reinstitute what he considered the proper trade policy
for Louisiana. In October 1802 he withdrew the right of deposit at New Orleans.
Together with the right to navigate the Mississippi, the right of deposit (the right to
transship cargo from river boats to ocean-going vessels without excise or customs
fee) had been granted to the United States for a term of three years by the Treaty of
San Lorenzo in 1796, and on the expiration of that term it had been tacitly continued
in effect. The withdrawal was a crippling blow to the commerce of the entire United
States west of the Appalachian system. Moreover, it was certain that the Mississippi
would remain closed after the transfer of Louisiana, for Napoleon's imperial brand of
mercantilism would seal it tight against everyone but the French.
Free navigation of the Mississippi and the right of deposit at its mouth, or some other
guarantee of free access to the Gulf of Mexico, were economic necessities to the
American West. They were therefore political necessities to the United States and to
the administration.
Water transport by way of the Ohio River system and the Mississippi afforded the
trans-Alleghany region its only practicable trade outlet. Primarily for that reason the
West was but loosely attached to the federal union, which after all in 1801 had been
in existence for only twelve years. Throughout the life of the Republic many
Westerners had argued and agitated, and some had conspired, for

Page xxx
the secession or separation of the West, in order to attach the area to Spain, France,
or Great Britain, or to establish an independent republic which could make favorable
arrangements with one of these countries. As Washington's Secretary of State,
Jefferson had had to deal at alarming length with the possibility that such a
separation might occur. Spain had once closed the Mississippi and thereafter, by
alternately loosening and tightening control, had repeatedly tried to coerce the
United States or detach the West.5 The treaty of 1796 had quieted both the agitation
and the conspiracies but had not killed either of them. All three foreign powers, but
most constantly Spain, had given secret encouragement and assistance to Western
separatist movements. The attitude toward the West of New England Federalists and
the growth of separatist feeling among them following Jefferson's election threatened
to intensify such movements.
Moreover, it had always been possible that the impatient Westerners might
themselves act to open the Mississippi permanently. They might raise irregular or
militia forces and seize New Orleans. (And St. Louis and lesser Louisiana
settlements.) That would mean war with Spain, not a dangerous prospect in itself
but one that would create a grave, possibly fatal, danger. The world had been on fire
since 1792; the wars of the French Revolution were becoming the Napoleonic Wars.
In such a world the entrance of the United States into any war would expose it to
attack by either France or Great Britain. The outcome might well be destruction.
Jefferson was confident that he could settle both the international and the domestic
crises to the advantage of the United States and without war. In the outcome his
confidence proved justified. He understood the meaning of events better and
estimated the forces at work more accurately than any other statesman of the time.
In our entire diplomatic history there has been no greater brilliance or skill than he
now displayed.
5 The closure was never absolute. The customs house at Natchez and the river
patrols ignored some American boats and with even greater frequency granted
permission to pass. The uncertainty and the expense combined with the
confiscation of many boats and the threat to confiscate every boat, however,
were as intolerable as complete closure. Even worse was the flagrant and
corrupt favoritism by which the officials, in return for political activity as well as
bribes, allowed such agents as Wilkinson the profitable privileges denied the
common trade.

Page xxxi
Jefferson was entirely clear, as the foreign offices of the other three powers were
and long had been, that if the United States entered a war, any war whatever, it
would seize not only the mouth of the Mississippi but the rest of Louisiana as well.
This fact must be understood, and the further fact that if Louisiana should thus
become American only severe defeat could force its return, such a defeat as might
involve the military occupation of a large portion of the United States. But it was
essential to avoid war. As soon as Jefferson learned that Louisiana was to be ceded
to France, he moved to settle the Mississippi question permanently. He directed the
American minister to France, Robert R. Livingston, to open negotiations for the
purchase of New Orleans,6 or failing that for the right of deposit or some other
means of temporarily saving the situation. Napoleon's foreign minister, Talleyrand,
completely frustrated Livingston, refusing to come to grips with his proposals. Yet by
October 1802, when the Spanish closed the Mississippi, it was evident that a change
in his attitude might soon occur, for the failure of French arms in San Domingo was
already far advanced.
The exceedingly sensitive situation became precarious as soon as the closure of the
river was announced. It was imperative to prevent the Westerners from taking
aggressive action, so that the State Department could continue its work. To convince
the West that diplomacy was better than force and that it promised results, Jefferson
appointed James Monroe "minister extraordinary and plenipotentiary" to negotiate
American rights in the Mississippi. Before Monroe reached Paris, however, Napoleon
had accepted the fact that he had failed in San Domingo. Abandoning his plan of
attacking the British Empire by way of the Western Hemisphere, he prepared to
attack it in the center, by way of Germany and the English Channel. It was certain
that on the outbreak of the war he now proposed to make Great Britain, the mistress
of the seas, would seize Louisiana. It was primarily to deny her such an enormous
increase of wealth and power that Napoleon determined to sell Louisiana to the
United States. Empowered to buy a city of seven
6 At various times the size of the area in view varied from a few square miles
embracing the city itself, or adjacent to it, on to the entire Isle of Orleans. This
was an area of about 2800 square miles, extending to the Gulf of Mexico from
the bodies of water lying east of the Mississippi, that actually made an island of
the city, Iberville River and Lakes Maurepas and Pontchartrain. As far back as
1790 the United States had tried to buy it from Spain.

Page xxxii
thousand inhabitants, Monroe found his colleague Livingston discussing (with the
minister of finance, Barbé-Marbois) the purchase of an area somewhat greater than
the United States. And since the maximum Livingston had been authorized to offer
for New Orleans was only three-quarters of what Napoleon asked, he was haggling
over the price.
The Louisiana Purchase was one of the most important events in world history. It
was an event of such magnitude that, as Henry Adams said, its results are beyond
measurement. Not only did it double the area of the United States, not only did it add
to our wealth resources of incalculable value, not only did it provide a potential that
was certain to make us a great power, not only did it make equally certain that we
would expand beyond the Rockies to the Pacific, and not only did it secure us against
foreign victory on any scale conceivable in the nineteenth century it also provided the
centripetal, unifying force that would hold the nation firm against disruptive forces
from within. Whether or not the rebellion that became the Civil War was inevitable,
the Purchase had made certain that it could not succeed. And there is no aspect of
our national life, no part of our social and political structure, and no subsequent
event in the main course of our history that it has not affected.
3
A curious convention of historiography has long held that the acquisition of all
Louisiana was a stunning surprise to Jefferson, and that he believed the area too
large to be governed by our political institutions. It is true that he did not expect to
obtain all Louisiana at this time and true that he occasionally, though with careful,
contingent reservations, faced the hypothesis that a Republic of the West might, at
some distant time and in certain eventualities, separate from the old Republic. But to
suppose that he did not fully expect the extension of American settlement across
Louisiana, or to suppose that he did not expect extension of settlement to produce
extension of sovereignty as well, is to ignore the most massive facts about the
nation his administration governed. They are all relevant to the Lewis and Clark
expedition.
Both as Secretary of State and as President, Jefferson had re-

Page xxxiii
peatedly declared that the United States must and would seize Louisiana if war
should break out. At an early stage of his negotiations with Talleyrand, Livingston
was proposing to buy a large part of Louisiana if not all of it. At the same time Rufus
King, our minister to London, was representing to the British that American
possession of Louisiana would surely be favorable to their interests. But there was a
far weightier fact: if war meant American possession, obviously peace meant it too.
The westward progress of settlement that had been filling up the Old West ever since
the Revolution was manifestly certain to take the American people across the
Mississippi in force, as it had already taken a large number of them by 1803.
American sovereignty was manifestly certain to follow them across the river at no
very distant data. Early predictions that this would happen, dating back to the
adoption of the Constitution or the peace treaty that recognized the independence of
the United States, may be dismissed as speculative. (Though the awareness they
signalized had also led Great Britain, France, and Spain to endeavor to confine the
United States east of the Alleghanies and then, failing that, to detach the West.) But
in 1803 the expectation was as logical and as realistic as any on which diplomacy can
be based, and discussions of it were routine in the dispatches of all the ministers in
Washington. Every chancellery in Europe knew that, unless severely defeated in war,
the United States was certain to cross the Mississippi and to advance an
unpredictable distance beyond it. Knowledge common to all Europe was not withheld
from the American President.
He had, in fact, acted on that knowledge. He was sending, as he had long intended
to send, an expedition to explore a water route for American commerce across the
territory of a foreign power. He could hardly have believed that the territory was long
to remain foreign. The reason why his message was secret was not that the
expedition was to be concealed from the three powers, to all of which it would be
fully visible and to two of which it was at once formally accredited. Not the expedition
but its true purpose was to be concealed. So far as secrecy was possible that
purpose had to be concealed, for it had in view the fur trade of Canada, the maritime
trade in sea otter and China goods, and the Columbia River, to whose basin the
United States had established a valid territorial claim through Captain Robert Gray's
discovery of its mouth in

Page xxxiv
1792. Jefferson's nomination of Monroe to his mission was dated January 11 1803
and Monroe's commission was dated January 13, seven and five days respectively
before the secret message; Jefferson had taken up the expedition with the Spanish
minister six weeks earlier. That is to say: before Monroe sailed to negotiate for the
mouth of the Mississippi, before in fact he was nominated to do so, Jefferson had
moved to acquire all Louisiana and, as well, the great expanse that was to be called
Oregon. Perhaps it would be just to reverse that order.
The expedition was to be commanded by Captain Meriwether Lewis, First Infantry,
U.S.A. He was then on detached duty, serving as Jefferson's private secretary.
Jefferson had offered him the position in February 1801, a month before his
inauguration. Lewis was a family friend7 but Jefferson had many friends better
qualified by background and education to be secretary to the President. He was,
however, uniquely qualified for a project which Jefferson had cherished for many
years, the exploration of the Missouri River and the lands west of its source.
Obviously, Jefferson entered office determined to carry out the project as soon as
possible and took Lewis into his personal and official household for that purpose.
Lewis had had a long experience of military command and wilderness life. He was
well acquainted with Jefferson's interest in the West and to explore it had long been
what he called ''a darling project of my heart." And, soliciting Jefferson's help, he had
applied to be made a member of André Michaux's attempt to make the exploration in
1793.
Two years as secretary and member of the official family served, as Jefferson said in
his instructions,8 to familiarize Lewis completely with "the objects of my confidential
message of Jan. 18, 1803, to the legislature. you have seen the act they passed,
which, tho' expressed in general terms, was meant to sanction those objects, and
you are appointed to carry them into execution."
The maritime trade of the Northwest coast, which was based on
7 He had gone to school to the Reverend James Maury, Jefferson's
schoolmaster and one of the group of ardent Virginia expansionists who
certainly fired his imagination for Western exploration at a very early age.
Maury was a conspicuous member of a long line of thinkers who regarded a
water route across North America as carrying with it political and commercial
domination of the continent. See DeVoto, op. cit., 411 ff.
8 The instructions are printed as Appendix I.

Page xxxv
the value of sea otter furs at Canton, had been opened by the British in 1785. The
first American ship that engaged in it was the Columbia, on her first voyage, 178790,
the one before she entered the river to which she gave her name. It was a rich trade
and by 1803 the Americans had all but cornered it. The sailing qualities of American
ships, the skill of their captains, and American business sagacity had been
fundamental in that triumph, but so had the restrictions under which British traders
had to operate. Nootka Sound, the original center of the trade, and the adjacent
coast were territory in which the South Seas Company held a monopoly charter from
the crown; Canton, where the furs were exchanged for China goods, was in the
territory of a similar and far more powerful monopoly, the East India Company. The
latter had opened the trade but its interests were elsewhere; British traders were
forced either to sail under license from it or to find some equally expensive way of
circumventing its demands. So that the China trade (comprehending in that term the
American commerce with the Orient which did not touch the Northwest coast as well
as that which did) had by 1803 become by far the greatest exterior wealth of the
United States.
Usually a trading voyage to "the Coast" lasted three years. It was exposed to all the
hazards of the Cape Horn route. If the Missouri and the Columbia did indeed provide
a water route across North America, as Jefferson believed, the voyage could be
shortened, the costs reduced, and the hazards almost eliminated. And there was a
further consideration, equally or perhaps even more important in this generation of
global warfare. Such a route would be safe from blockade, navies, and privateers.
The discovery of this route would be inestimably valuable to the United States. It is
hardly necessary to fill out the syllogism. The route would not be expeditious, cheap,
and safe from blockade and attack if the territory it crossed were to remain foreign
soil.
These vital considerations grew in exigency as the value of the trade increased and
the wars spread. Another compelling circumstance had been intensifying for exactly
ten years. The Canadian fur trade east of the Rocky Mountains, much of which
Jefferson hoped to divert to American waterways and even to American
management, had been endeavoring to establish a base on the Pacific coast.

Page xxxvi
The development of the trade in the Canadian West and North was primarily the
achievement of the North West Company. An organization of remarkably able and
daring businessmen, it had become the first large-scale enterprise of the continent
and in effect the first trust. It had opened and organized the rich beaver country
along the Saskatchewan and Athabaska Rivers, extending its operations to the Arctic
on the north, the Rockies on the west, and the Big Bend of the Missouri on the
south. By superior skill and enterprise it had won supremacy over its great rival, the
cumbersome, conservative Hudson's Bay Company. Yet the English company had an
advantage which enabled it to remain in competition and which had grown steadily
more important. Like the East India Company it held a monopoly charter from the
crown: it alone could use Hudson Bay and the rivers that emptied into it from the
west, of which the Hayes was the most important, for access to the beaver country.
All the North West Company's goods, supplies, and furs had to be transported to and
from Montreal, where deepwater carriage began, along the difficult and almost
endless canoe route which Jefferson described to Congress. Every additional mile the
North West Company incorporated in its system added to the difficulty and the cost
of doing business. Time, distance, logistics, finance, terms and duration of credit had
combined to force on the Northwesters an organization remarkably like that of a
twentieth-century industrial corporation all for the purpose of carrying goods from
Montreal to the beaver country and carrying furs back to Montreal. Whereas the
Hudson's Bay Company, loading its goods at London, could take them direct to Port
Nelson, at 92° W. and 57° N. before transshipping them to a river route.
As soon as they reached the far longitudes and high latitudes, the North West
Company partners had realized the great desirability of extending their trade network
to the Pacific. Deepwater transport to Nootka or some other depot on the coast
would neutralize the Hudson's Bay Company's advantage, expediting carriage and
enormously lowering the overhead. In 1781, twenty-two years before Jefferson's
message, Alexander Henry the elder had proposed to the Royal Society an
exploration to discover a water route to the Pacific in the high latitudes. His ideas had
been formed by his partner, the crabbed genius Peter Pond. Pond himself trained and

Page xxxvii
inspired the young man who eventually tried to put them into effect. This was
Alexander Mackenzie, one of the principal wintering partners, a brilliant geopolitical
thinker, and among the most remarkable of American explorers.
In 1789 Mackenzie made an attempt to find the route to the Pacific that Pond had
thought must exist north of Lake Athabaska. The venture led him to the river named
for him and to the Arctic, not the Pacific. This failure dampened the enthusiasm of
the North West Company, but the necessity remained unchanged and the less
conservative partners supported Mackenzie's desire to continue the exploration. In
1793, the year of André Michaux's abortive attempt, Mackenzie succeeded in
reaching the Pacific after as daring and exciting a journey as any in the annals of
discovery. He thus became the first man since Cabeza de Vaca, in 1536, to make a
transcontinental crossing north of Mexico. His route involved the Peace River, a
stretch of the Fraser River, the Blackwater River, and a long land traverse (the heart
of the matter) to the Bella Coola River which led to the sea north of Vancouver
Island.
It was a magnificent achievement but commercially futile. To take goods and furs by
canoe along this route was impossible. The Rocky Mountains and the kind of rivers
that threaded them forbade.
Mackenzie had been led to the Fraser, for which he used an Indian name, Tacoutche
Tesse, by Indian reports that it was a big river and emptied into the Pacific. The
mouth of the Fraser is just north of 49°, at the city of Vancouver, on the Strait of
Georgia, but Mackenzie did not reach the mouth. Unable to take his canoe through
the furious water of its upper canyons, he had to abandon it and eventually
descended the Bella Coola. When he returned to civilization, he learned that the
American Captain Gray had discovered the mouth of a big river at 46°. He assumed
that this, the Columbia, must be the river which he had been unable to descend, the
Tacoutche Tesse. So, till Lewis and Clark, did everyone else. Meanwhile it remained
possible, and in Mackenzie's view likely, that below the place where he had been
forced away from it, the Tacoutche Tesse might be navigable and therefore that the
North West Company canoes could descend it with their furs. If this were true, the
Northwesters must reach it by some route as yet undiscovered but one that led
through British territory.

Page xxxviii
Mackenzie was now dedicated to getting a Pacific outlet for his company. And now
the intensifying urgency that Jefferson felt was communicated to him as well. The
Americans had established a claim to the great river part of which, so he thought, he
had traveled and which, so he believed, was the solution to the Company's problem.
And not only that: the Americans were wresting the maritime trade of the Northwest
coast from the British. Mackenzie worked out a plan which foreshadowed the pattern
of nineteenth-century British imperialism. But though some North West Company
partners supported his ideas, he was frustrated by the hostility, arrogance, and
financial conservatism of Simon McTavish, who was the real head of the trust.
In 1799 therefore Mackenzie withdrew from the North West Company and went to
England, to try to realize his imperial vision by exterior means. In its final form his
plan had three parts:
1. The Hudson's Bay Company must either merge with the North West Company or
else grant or lease to it the right to transport goods to the western shore of the Bay
and thence to the fur country. If the HBC should refuse to do either, then Parliament
must so alter its charter as to enable the Northwesters to use its route. (When it
refused, Mackenzie tried to carry the position by financial maneuvers, organizing a
syndicate to buy the closely held, immensely valuable HBC stock it was thus that
Lord Selkirk began his fateful career in Canada. In the succeeding years the
Northwesters tried to secure the right of transport on the HBC routes by negotiation,
by lease or purchase, and by appeal to Parliament.9 Eventually, following actual
guerrilla war between the two companies, Parliament forced precisely the merger
that Mackenzie had urged in the beginning.)
2. Either the merger or the North West Company must secure a firm position on the
Northwest coast. Thereupon the East India Company must concede it the right to
trade at Canton on terms that would make competition with the Americans possible.
3. West of the Continental Divide, British sovereignty must be extended southward
far enough to include the Columbia River,
9 British energy and money were absorbed by the Napoleonic Wars or, very
likely, Mackenzie's vision would have been acted on by government or by
private enterprise. This delay was Napoleon's second gift to American
expansion.

Page xxxix
which Mackenzie expected to become the route between the beaver country and the
Pacific. This, of course, was a problem not for the fur merchants but for the
government. In a proposal made after his book was published Mackenzie explained
that sovereignty must be supported by a military establishment at Nootka with
subsidiary ones at the mouth of the Columbia and elsewhere. He believed that Great
Britain had unwisely abandoned her rights east of the Divide when treaties and
conventions relating to the Canadian boundary were drawn up, and that the damage
thus done must be repaired. He believed, specifically, that Canada was legally and
morally entitled to a connection between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi, that it
was entitled also to exclusive possession of the great canoe route from Lake
Superior to Lake of the Woods, that (west of Lake Superior) British sovereignty
extended south to 45°, and that the boundary must be relocated accordingly.10 If
this readjustment could not be made, it was still possible to make the Columbia River
securely British and this must be done.
This constituted a blueprint for imperial expansion. At the end of his exposition and
analysis Mackenzie says:
By opening this intercourse between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and
forming regular establishments through the interior and at both extremes, as
well as along the coasts and islands, the entire command of the fur trade of
North America might be obtained from 48° North to the pole, except that
portion of it which the Russians have in the Pacific. To this may be added the
fishing in both seas and the markets of the four quarters of the globe. Such
would be the field for commercial enterprise and incalculable would be the
produce of it,
10 The boundary ambiguities resulted from ignorance, at the peace treaty
following the Revolution, of the source of the Mississippi. Mackenzie's proposal
looked to establishing a connection with the Mississippi from the western end
of Lake Superior. The St. Louis River would provide the beginning of such a
connection but the line must be drawn far enough south to reach the
Mississippi at a point where it was navigable by canoes; its extreme upper
reach he regarded as ''a brook." The 45th parallel is just above Minneapolis;
the rectified boundary would run due west from here to intersect a line drawn
south from the western shore of Lake of the Woods. It crosses South Dakota,
the upper third of which would thus with North Dakota become Canadian, and
is the southern boundary of Montana as far as the Continental Divide.
Mackenzie's plan allows for the possibility that this equitable and highly
desirable relocation might not be secured. But west of the Divide the Columbia
must be made British and the 45th parallel would effect this; it crosses Oregon
just below the latitude of Salem.

Page xl
when supported by the operations of that credit and capital which Great Britain
so pre-eminently possesses. Then would this country begin to be remunerated
for the expenses it has sustained in discovering and surveying the coast of the
Pacific Ocean, which is at present left to American adventurers. . . . Such
adventurers, and many of them, as I have been informed, have been very
successful, would instantly disappear before a well-regulated trade. . . . Many
political reasons, which it is not necessary here to enumerate, must present
themselves to the mind of every man acquainted with the enlarged system and
capacities of British commerce in support of the Measure which I have very
briefly suggested, as promising the most important advantages of the trade of
the united kingdoms.
The quoted passage ends Mackenzie's book, Voyages from Montreal, which was
published late in 1801. Lewis and Clark took a copy of it west with them and it
obviously had conclusive force for Jefferson. The President, who already
contemplated moving to secure the Columbia to the United States, was thus notified
by the most powerful personality in the Canadian fur trade that the fur trust intended
to secure the Columbia to Great Britain. The notification, however, only increased his
realization that the situation was urgent, for he had long understood the essentials of
what Mackenzie set forth.
Following Mackenzie's withdrawal from the North West Company, the despotic
McTavish relaxed sufficiently to permit some action on his ideas. For a number of
years the fur merchants of St. Louis and the Spanish officials there had known of the
company's intention to carry the trade to the Rocky Mountains in Louisiana as it had
done in Canada. Now the summer meeting of the North West partners in 1800 voted
to send explorers over the Canadian Rockies to the vital area. Duncan M'Gillivray,
who was the principal exponent of Mackenzie's ideas, and David Thompson, who
was the company's most gifted surveyor, prepared to make the exploration. In the
fall of 1800 two of their engagés crossed the mountains to prepare a base. Some
students have believed that in the next year, 1801, either M'Gillivray or Thompson or
both made a quick crossing to the base, but this is not evident and indeed it is
unlikely. At least a start had been made toward the execution of Mackenzie's ideas,
however, when Jefferson addressed Congress this in addition to Mackenzie's polemic
and his financial efforts in England to get support for them.

Page xli
These and other efforts continued through the succeeding years. In 1802 Mackenzie
returned to Canada and joined the most violent and most successful opposition the
North West Company had ever had, a group of former partners and some additional
associates usually called the X Y Company in the literature. In 1804 McTavish died
and the X Y Company rejoined the North West Company. (News of this reached
Lewis and Clark at Fort Mandan; see the journal for March 2 1805.) Immediate
resumption of Mackenzie's plan was now possible, and though he was denied
participation in field management, Duncan M'Gillivray, who spoke for him, grew
steadily in power. Even before tidings of the merger reached the West, François
Larocque of the North West Company's Assiniboine Department asked to accompany
Lewis and Clark to the Pacific. His request was refused but in the summer of 1805 he
made the long contemplated attempt to open the western Louisiana trade, traveling
west from the Mandan villages to the Yellowstone River and returning down its
valley, while Lewis and Clark were ascending the Missouri. In that same summer,
and there can be no doubt that Lewis and Clark were a contributing cause, the
partners voted to make a permanent establishment west of the mountains. And
Simon Fraser crossed to the Tacoutche Tesse, which in common with everyone else
he took to be the Columbia, and built the first trading post on Pacific drainage. He
left a party to spend there the same winter that Lewis and Clark spent at Fort
Clatsop.
The continuation of this policy may be outlined here. In 1806, the year in which
Lewis and Clark made their return journey, Fraser made another extensive
exploration farther north, in the country to which he gave the long-memorable name,
New Caledonia. He built two other permanent posts there, so that the Northwesters
now had three west of the Continental Divide. New Caledonia, however, was in the
high latitudes and it offered no water route to the Pacific; it did not satisfy the
Northwesters' requirements. In the same year, 1806, therefore, David Thompson
sent two men to cut a horse trail across the Canadian Rockies farther south. In
1807, beginning a permanent occupation, he reached the Columbia. He did not
recognize it as the Columbia but determined its longitude and realized that it was not
the Tacoutche Tesse. (He named it the Kootanae.) The next year,

Page xlii
1808, Thompson moved south of 49° into Idaho. In 1809, provided with information
from the first published account of Lewis and Clark, the journal of Patrick Gass, he
went still deeper into territory that is now American, the site of Missoula, Montana.
But not till 1811 and there is no satisfactory explanation of his delay did he descend
the Columbia to the sea. He reached it too late by a few months: John Jacob Astor's
Pacific Fur Company had got there first and had built Fort Astoria. Meanwhile in 1808
Simon Fraser, triumphing over the ferocious waters that had turned Mackenzie back,
had taken a party down the Tacoutche Tesse, now the Fraser, to its mouth. So he
had made the shattering discovery that it was not the Columbia after all.
4
Unless all these forces, pressures, and actions are taken into account, Jefferson's
purpose in sending Lewis and Clark up the Missouri and on to the Pacific cannot be
understood.11 (Those mentioned in the last paragraph above were developments of
situations already existing in January 1803 when Jefferson asked for the
appropriation, and were either foreseen or understood as implicit when he entered
office in March 1801.) The "literary" purpose was subsidiary to the others, though it
might be of assistance to them. The others can now be stated with assurance.
11 It must be constantly remembered that in 1801 when Jefferson addressed
Congress, Louisiana was Spanish territory and destined to become French, and
that the United States had a recognized prior claim to the Columbia country, to
which Spain had some claim and which both Great Britain (by the Nootka
convention) and Russia might also make claim. Thus Jefferson's proposal to
establish an American trade route down the Missouri was a proposal to
establish American trade in territory from which French law must exclude it.
This same route across foreign soil was to be used to give American trade an
overland connection with the Columbia. That region, in January 1803, was a
legitimate field for American expansion as Louisiana was not. The American
prior claim to it was, according to usages of nations, so good that in the same
year as Gray's discovery of the Columbia, Vancouver had to take the stand for
Great Britain that Gray had never really entered the river, whereas his
lieutenant, Broughton, had. This remained the official British stand till the
Oregon question was settled.
In January 1803, the attractive force, therefore, was the Columbia region, a
detached portion of the American economy, to sovereignty over which the United
States had a prior but unadjudicated and untested claim. The tacitly assumed
force was the extension of American settlement into Louisiana.

Page xliii
The expedition was to survey in detail the water route up the Missouri and down the
Columbia which, so Jefferson supposed, would provide easy transport between the
Mississippi and the Pacific. It was to give the United States a direct overland
connection with the maritime trade of the Northwest coast. It was to amass the
details on which could be laid the groundwork for an American challenge to the North
West Company's route of carriage from the beaver country of northwestern Canada,
a challenge which might result in just such a trade victory as the sea captains had
won at Nootka. Using the standard techniques of negotiating with Indians, it was to
prepare the tribes for this challenge, and for the coming of American traders. That is,
it was to advertise the superiority of American trade its superiority to the FrenchSpanish trade from St. Louis and the British trade of the upper Mississippi and the
Assiniboine. It was to establish as much intertribal peace as possible. This much is
explicit and another purpose is clearly implied: to buttress the American claim to the
Oregon country which rested on the Columbia's discovery by making a land traverse
before the British could.
All this in January 1803, when Jefferson addressed Congress and when Louisiana
was to remain a French possession. By the middle of June news of Livingston's and
Monroe's astonishing triumph reached Washington. The acquisition of Louisiana
provided additional duties for the expedition that was to have crossed it as foreign
soil. Any fact whatever that could be learned about its far northern fringe would now
be welcome, for it might bear on the uncertainties of the boundary and the disputes
about them. Also, it was now important to learn as much as possible about the
southwestern reaches of Louisiana, the Spanish settlements (which had only an
occasional connection with St. Louis), and the topographical, military, and
commercial problems associated with them. All the Indian tribes which the expedition
would encounter must be notified that the Great Father now lived in Washington and
that their allegiance had changed with his residence. In particular the Sioux, about
whose hostility to St. Louis traders the administration was well informed, must be
impressed by American strength and authority. The British traders who were known
to be in the vicinity of the Mandan villages where their presence was illegal under
Spanish law and would have continued to be under French

Page xliv
law must be notified of their accountability as well as their privileges under American
jurisdiction. Finally, there was the increased but still deluded hope that the
expedition could produce a general prairie peace. It was to induce the tribes to make
sacredly binding treaties with one another and it was to persuade delegations of
chiefs to travel to Washington, to be impressed by the power and splendor of
American civilization.
Two further points. Jefferson's instructions to Lewis say that he need not pay so
much attention to the northern affluents of the Missouri River as to the southern
ones, for it may be assumed that the British fur companies have pretty well found
out whatever should be known about them. This remark is sharply at variance with
the behavior of the captains in the field. No other inquiry recorded in the journals is
made so persistently as the one about the northern tributaries. At Fort Mandan and
beyond it, on both the outward and the return journeys, Lewis and Clark are
incessantly preoccupied with the desirability of finding a northern affluent that will
lead to the Saskatchewan and the Athabaska. Since this search dovetails with the
purpose which Jefferson expressed in his secret message and with his theory about
the northern boundary as he phrased it in a memorandum for the ministers to France
and Spain, we must conclude that he privately directed Lewis to solve the problem.
Finally, the journals contain abundant evidence relating to another purpose that is
not specifically stated in either the message to Congress or the instructions to Lewis.
The captains repeatedly promise tribes west of the Continental Divide that the
Americans will soon open the trade in their country. Two reports by Lewis and one
by Clark discuss problems and measures connected with this innovation. The
development will require two stages. First, posts will be set up east of the Divide, in
American Louisiana, and the tribes will be encouraged to cross the mountains and
trade at them. (Protection from the Blackfeet will be provided for them.) Later, when
the system has grown in strength, posts will be established west of the Divide, in the
home country of the tribes that have become customers during the first stage. No
one can suppose that agents of the American government could so confidently
promise action of such serious import unless they had directions from the President
to do so. Note once more that this trade is to be opened in country that is not
American soil when the promises are made.

Page xlv

Jefferson's instructions to Lewis say: ''The object of your mission is to explore the
Missouri river, & such principal stream of it, as, by it's course & communication with
the waters of the Pacific Ocean, may offer the most direct & practicable water
communication across this continent, for the purposes of commerce." Ten years
earlier, in 1793, speaking for the American Philosophical Society, he had phrased the
same objective. André Michaux was "to pursue such of the largest streams of [the
Missouri] as shall lead by the shortest way and the lowest latitudes to the Pacific
ocean. When, pursuing those streams, you shall find yourself at the point from
whence you may get by the shortest and most convenient route to some principal
river of the Pacific ocean, you are to proceed to such river and pursue its course to
the ocean." When he drafted these instructions for Michaux, the Columbia had not
yet returned to the States, and so he did not know of Captain Gray's momentous
discovery. He reminded Michaux that a large river was supposed to come down to
the Pacific somewhere in the vicinity of Nootka, and said that this river would
probably prove to be his best route. It was called the Oregon, he said, and its waters
"interlocked with the Missouri for a considerable distance." So Jefferson and the sum
of geographical knowledge understood. But the Oregon was an entirely hypothetical
river, the current embodiment of the imaginary stream, the River of the West, which
for more than a century had been believed, deduced, and rumored to cross the part
of North America that lay west of the height of land.12
12 Rivers that reach the sea must come down to it from a height of land, and
on the western coast of a continent the height of land from which they come
down must be inland to the east these axioms behind the theory of the River of
the West are entirely sound. The theory, however, had been elaborated from
additional axioms which postulated a geographical symmetry at variance with
the realities of the North American continent. In its ideal form the theory held
that from a fundamental height of land a principal river ran in each of the
cardinal directions. The River of the East was the St. Lawrence, which was
understood to include the entire chain of the Great Lakes it drained; the River
of the South was the Mississippi. The River of the North was hypothetical until
the Nelson, which drains Lake Winnipeg, was fairly well understood. By the
time the Coppermine and Mackenzie were discovered, the concept of a
fundamental height of land had to be abandoned and they could not be
assumed to "head" with the Mississippi and the St. Lawrence. By 1793 the
River of the West could not head with them, either, but it could with the
Missouri.

Page xlvi
There had to be such a river; the logic of geography, of teleology, and of desire
required one. When the Columbia was discovered, it was almost universally accepted
as the River of the West. Following Mackenzie's crossing, his Tacoutche Tesse was
believed to be the Columbia. The Tacoutche Tesse was the only addition to
knowledge of or relating to the vital area which Lewis and Clark must cross, and its
relationship was unknown. That area was entirely untraveled by white men: between
the Great Bend of the Missouri, in central North Dakota, and the place where the
Columbia issued from the Cascade Mountains. Vancouver's Lieutenant Broughton
had traveled the Columbia from its mouth almost to that emergence from the
Cascades. Mackenzie's crossing had provided no actual knowledge of the area, but it
had opened it to additional speculation.
The reader has long since perceived that, in the widest view, the Lewis and Clark
expedition belongs to the line of endeavor that had taken Columbus to the New
World, the effort to establish a western trade route with the Orient. Specifically, it
belongs to the branch of that endeavor which undertook to find direct water
communication between the Atlantic and the Pacific, a waterway that led across the
land mass of North America. Belief in the existence of such a landlocked Northwest
Passage dates back almost to Columbus. Various conceptions of it had existed: as a
strait or series of straits leading entirely across the continent at almost any latitude;
as such a strait connecting the Pacific with Hudson Bay or the Arctic; as a river route
connecting the eastern rivers or the Great Lakes with a body of salt or fresh water in
the interior of the continent (the hypothetical or imaginary Western Sea) whence
other rivers, or an arm of the sea, would lead on to the Pacific.
By the middle of the eighteenth century, explorations of Hudson Bay had proved that
no strait led westward from its far shore, but though this should have destroyed that
particular variant of the ancient hope it did not. In 1771 Samuel Hearne of the
Hudson's Bay Company went down the Coppermine River to the Arctic. In 1789
Alexander Mackenzie discovered the Mackenzie River and descended it to the Arctic.
Meanwhile in 1778 the great James Cook, on his third voyage, had proved that north
of Nootka Sound there existed no strait or river which could be the western portal of
the Northwest Passage. Gradually the significance of these voy-

Page xlvii
ages was realized. When Mackenzie's transcontinental crossing was added to them,
that there was no water route to the Pacific in the area of Canada (north of 49°)
should have been accepted as proved. For the most part it was so accepted but a
few geographical thinkers on both sides of the Atlantic continued to believe that
somehow there must be a connection by way of Lake Winnipeg, though the rivers of
Lake Winnipeg flow into it from the west. This conception cannot be phrased clearly
for it was not precise. But it could convert to the service of wishfulness one hiatus in
knowledge that remained following Mackenzie's two voyages. On the first of them he
had learned that a mountain barrier extended north all the way to the Arctic. On the
second this same barrier, or one to the west of it (and no one, including Mackenzie,
had decided which), had prevented him from descending the Tacoutche Tesse to the
sea. But how far to the south of his land-crossing did the mountain barrier extend?
Yrujo reminded Jefferson that "a very considerable cordillera" existed between 50°
and 60°. Did it extend below 50° and how continuously? Those who brought
Arrowsmith's maps to bear on the problem saw the Rockies as a single chain and
knew that this presentation was wholly speculative south of the route ascribed to
Peter Fidler, which carried him to 45°. (Actually, Fidler had not reached as far south
as 50°.) Northward from New Mexico there was only speculation about the Rockies.
Might there not be a gap in the "cordillera" through which a water route led to the
Pacific? There might indeed be a gap, and therefore conceivably (though in
retrospect one wonders how) it might somehow connect with Lake Winnipeg. And
indeed the best knowledge in St. Louis indicated that there was. On the basis of what
St. Louis traders had learned, or thought they had learned, from the Indians, the
Missouri River might flow through such a gap and, in any event, the Missouri could
be followed to and into the mountains. And, St. Louis believed, if you ascended the
Missouri, which was navigable all the way, it would lead you to within a very short
distance of the Pacific, at most a hundred miles.
These various ideas cannot be harmonized for the simple but adequate reason that
they define the state of knowledge, which is always a definition of ignorance as well.
But the components of knowledge can never be harmonized until all the relevant
facts

Page xlviii
are in. And the bearing of everything that was known and assumed was clear: the
one remaining hope of the water passage from sea to sea was provided by the
Missouri River.
Jolliet and Marquette discovered the mouth of the Missouri in 1673. From then on in
the ideas that were held of American geography, prismatic with illusion and
misconception, the river was supposed to lead near or to the Pacific. No conception
of it provided a basis of action, however, and there was no realistic knowledge in the
first reasoned proposal to use it as a route to the Pacific, that of the Jesuit Pierre
Charlevoix in 1720. Charlevoix had been sent to America by the French government,
which was under increasing urgency to reach the Pacific overland, to collect all the
existing information about possible routes. He decided that by ascending the
Missouri one could reach the Western Sea, which would be found to have some kind
of connection with the Northwest Passage. The great explorer Pierre Gaultier de
Varennes de la Vérendrye was commissioned to discover the route proposed by
Charlevoix. In 1738 he reached the Missouri with his sons, traveling from the Lake
Winnipeg region to the Mandan villages below the Great Bend. The Vérendryes were
the first white men to see the Upper Missouri (and one of them was the effective
discoverer of the other key river of the West, the Saskatchewan) but nothing came
of their enterprise.
British thinking about the Missouri route to the Pacific was almost as old, dating back
to 1727, when Daniel Coxe concocted the error that was to prove most durable of
all, the theorem that only a very short land traverse would be found necessary from
Missouri to Pacific waters. Attention was permanently focused on the Missouri route,
however, by Robert Rogers, or rather first by his employe Jonathan Carver. In 1765
Rogers proposed to reach the "River Ouragan" from "the head of the Mississippi." It
was Carver who, during his journey in Wisconsin and Minnesota, 1766-67,
determined that the Missouri was a conceivable route. (And who fixed the spelling of
the great name as Oregon.) When Rogers renewed his proposal in 1772, he specified
the Missouri, intending to travel it to the source.
Rogers asserted in 1772 that a portage of "about twenty miles" separated navigable
waters of the Missouri and the Oregon. Coxe in 1727 had made his hypothetical
separation "a ridge of hills"

Page xlix
which would prove ''passable by horse, foot, or wagon in less than half a day."
Jefferson accepted this conception; it defines the "single portage from the Western
Ocean" of his message to Congress. It is the basic and crucial conception in his plan,
as indeed it had been in all theorems concerning a water route for commerce and (in
the Spanish view) for military invasion.
This basic conception, this irreducible minimum, left no room for the Rocky
Mountains. Geographical thinking had been unable to imagine them unable first to
imagine their existence and then, when their eastern slope in Canada became
familiar, unable to imagine their width or the impossibility of traversing them by
canoe. The Spanish knew the southern end of the Rockies in New Mexico and most
of the eastern slope in Colorado and in the 1760's they began to travel along the
western slope, but did not penetrate them. But the Rockies had been crossed only
by Mackenzie's party, and his experience did not give him or suggest to anyone else
a realistic conception of the obstacle they were to freight transport by water. In
Clark's entry for February 14 1806 Jefferson's "single portage" (Rogers's "twenty
miles" and Coxe's "less than half a day") becomes an actual land traverse of 220
miles. That in itself wrecked the expectation of three centuries. And even so, it
disregarded the difficulty and expense of water travel on the Missouri above the
Great Falls.
In the 1790's Spanish officials and French fur traders in St. Louis had put together
from Indian accounts a conception of the Rockies as a single or multiple mountain
range that ran parallel to the Pacific coast and a varying distance from it usually less
than a hundred miles inland. They believed that the Missouri led up to this range and
well into it, or through it by means of a gap or across it by means of a gap and a
long and hardly imaginable fall. That vestiges of this idea figured in Jefferson's
thinking is evident from his instructions to Lewis and from entries in the captains'
journals.
The Missouri was familiar from its mouth to the Mandan villages, some sixty miles
upstream from Bismarck, where Lewis and Clark spent the winter of 18045. French
traders from the Illinois country entered its mouth shortly before 1700. Between
1712 and 1717 Etienne de Bourgmond ranged as far as the mouth of the Platte,
perhaps a little farther. The Platte, which was always regarded as the "equator" of
the upstream journey, remained the

Page l
limit of knowledge till shortly before 1790, when somewhat higher ascents were
made. Then the Spanish and French of St. Louis undertook to reach the Pacific, both
to rescue the Indian trade of upper Louisiana from the British and to secure the route
as a military frontier to defend New Mexico. (That New Mexico was considered in
danger of invasion by both land and water from Canada shows how ignorant of the
land mass they were, how much smaller than it is they conceived it to be.) They got
as far as the Mandan villages, but only with great difficulty, and got no farther.13
They could not finance further exploration nor were they able to compete with the
British trade, which had reached the Mandan villages about 1785, coming down from
the Assiniboine River and its affluent the Souris.
The tribes between the Platte and the James Omahas, Otos, and Poncas harassed
and blackmailed the small trading parties that ascended the Missouri from St. Louis.
They were less important, however, than the two tribes immediately beyond them,
the Arikaras and the Sioux. The former had been till lately a powerful people but they
had been weakened by smallpox epidemics and by the Sioux, whose westward
migration had reached the Missouri in force. Both tribes sought to establish
themselves as middlemen in the upriver trade the desire of all Indian tribes and a
recurrent cause of wars. In this position they could secure the profits of the trade to
themselves and could control the supply of guns and powder to their enemies. In
effect the two tribes closed the Upper Missouri to St. Louis traders as the Spanish at
New Orleans had closed the Mississippi to the Americans. A few years before Lewis
and Clark the Sioux had established permanent supremacy over the Arikaras. Among
the most warlike of Indians, swaggerers and bullies, bound firmly to the British by
the superior goods and cheaper prices of the British trade, incited to opposition by
the British who traded with them on the Des Moines and James Rivers, the Sioux
were a formidable obstacle to trade, to exploration, and to the exercise of
sovereignty over upper Louisiana. That
13 They supposed themselves then so near to the Pacific that a journey to the
coast from the villages, or even from the Platte, and return could be made in a
single season. An inexplicable vestige of this naïveté still lingered in Lewis's
mind when the expedition started west from the villages in 1805, in spite of the
fact that during the winter Clark had worked out an astonishingly accurate
table of distances as far as the mountains.

Page li
is why so much hung on the meeting of Lewis and Clark with them, which must be
regarded as one of the crises of the expedition.
6
In 1803 Meriwether Lewis was twenty-nine years old. He had joined the militia at the
time of the Whiskey Rebellion, at its end he had transferred to the regular army, and
he had remained in service ever since. For a short period he had been an ensign in a
rifle company commanded by Captain William Clark, and the two had developed an
enduring respect for each other. Clark was the youngest brother of George Rogers
Clark, who had played the leading role in the actions that saved the trans-Alleghany
West for the United States during the Revolution, and whom Jefferson had once
proposed to send on an exploring expedition across Louisiana. He was thirty-three
years old in 1803. He too had militia service before becoming a regular, and unlike
Lewis he saw considerable Indian fighting. He resigned his captaincy in 1796.
Thus both leaders of the expedition had had much experience of command and of
wilderness life. Clark was Lewis's choice to share the expedition, and Lewis promised
him, on Jefferson's authority, equality of command and a captain's commission. The
War Department, however, found bureaucratic reasons to frustrate the President's
intention and commissioned Clark a second lieutenant in the Corps of Artillerists.
Nevertheless, the journals always refer to him as "Captain Clark" and he signs that
rank to orders and other official papers. That the promised equality of command
became a fact is evident. But it is also evident that if there had been any occasion to
interrupt it, by personality and temperament Lewis was the natural commander and
Clark the adjutant. There never was an occasion; the two agreed and worked
together with a mutuality unknown elsewhere in the history of exploration and rare in
any kind of human association.
Their roles in the expedition are also self-evident in the journals. Lewis was the
diplomatic and commercial thinker, Clark the negotiator. Lewis, who went specially
to Philadelphia for training in botany, zoology, and celestial navigation, was the
scientific specialist, Clark the engineer and geographer as well as the master of
frontier crafts. Both were experienced rivermen but Lewis acknowl-

Page lii
edged that Clark had greater skill and usually left the management of the boats to
him. Clark evidently had the greater gift for dealing with Indians. But by chance
Lewis was alone at two critical encounters with Indians, the Snakes and the
Blackfeet, and he handled them with an expertness that no one could have
surpassed. Lewis was better educated than Clark and he had a speculative mind;
almost all the abstract ideas and philosophical remarks in the journals are his. He
was introverted and mercurial almost all the bursts of anger and all the depressed
moods are his too whereas Clark was extroverted and even-tempered. Both were
men of great intelligence, of distinguished intelligence. The entire previous history of
North American exploration contains no one who could be called their intellectual
equal.
In fact, intelligence was the principal reason for the success of the expedition, which
is also unequaled in American history and hardly surpassed in the history of
exploration anywhere. They were masters of every situation and they successfully
handled every emergency. Remarkably few emergencies arose, a fact which always
defines expert management of wilderness travel. The expedition was of proper,
though minimal, size. It was intelligently and adequately equipped, though trade
goods ran out and Jefferson was inexplicably negligent in failing to send a ship to the
mouth of the Columbia so that the outfit could have been replaced and the supplies
replenished.14 The company was recruited with good judgment and was physically
hardened and well disciplined by six months of cantonment life in the winter of
18034, on the Illinois shore, opposite the mouth of the Missouri. Only a few
infractions of discipline are recorded in the journals and all but one of these occur
before the arrival at the Mandans.15 Moses Reed
14 Obviously, the inventories which Thwaites found and published fail to list
the equipment and supplies in full. For instance, in caches at the Three Forks,
at the head of the Jefferson, and at Canoe Camp on the Clearwater, almost as
much gunpowder is deposited as the inventories show this on an expedition
that had been using gunpowder daily since it left St. Louis and giving sizable
amounts of it to Indians. It is equally clear that the original appropriation of
$2500 fell short of paying for the expedition but no records of supplementary
payments have been found. They could have been made from the Executive's
free funds or charged against either the War Department or the State
Department.
15 The journals of the captains record the floggings inflicted by sentence of courtmartial. Those of Ordway, Gass, and Whitehouse so conspicuously fail to mention
them as to suggest that they may have been directed to make no record of them.

deserted in the vicinity of the Platte and so did "La Liberté," a boatman whose
connection with the expedition is ambiguous. John Newman was dropped from the
permanent party and sent back from the Mandan villages to be discharged, in
punishment of an outburst of insubordination. There was no further trouble serious
enough to be noted in the journals, and a quarrel between Drewyer and Colter was
so unusual an occurrence that it is noted. All of which is evidence that cuts two
ways: the recruits were sound stock and the captains were remarkable leaders.
Unquestionably, military organization and military discipline added effectiveness to
the wilderness techniques and so help to explain the success of the expedition, but
after the opening weeks of the journals the reader will seldom, if ever, be aware of
them.
The only fatality of the expedition, Charles Floyd's death, could not have been
prevented. His symptoms suggest a ruptured appendix, which at that period would
almost certainly have been fatal anywhere. There was only one serious accident,
Cruzatte's wounding of Lewis while they were hunting in the brush. Cruzatte was
blind in one eye and the vision of his other eye was impaired, but he nevertheless
was one of the expedition's best plainsmen (in the captains' estimation ranking just
below Drewyer), as he was its master riverman. And he had been acquitting himself
brilliantly as a hunter for two years.
It is the very singularity of these occurrences and certain lesser episodes that makes
them stand out so prominently against a background of wilderness travel so expertly
conducted that it seems commonplace, to be expected. Indeed, except on the upper
stages of the Jefferson, where the labor is enormous, and on the crossing of the
Bitterroots where food fails, it seems easy. Yet most of it was exceedingly difficult,
recurring portions of its were dangerous in a high degree, and nearly all of it was in
country foreign to the wilderness experience of Americans and requiring radically
different techniques. Not only the Rocky Mountains, their rivers, and the Cascade
Mountains were unprecedented and unimaginable; so were the high plains, the high
plateaus, the overwhelming waters of the Columbia, the tremendous forest of the
Northwest, and the sodden winter climate there. It added up to a strangeness for
which nothing in the previous frontier culture was a preparation. The impact of these
new conditions on the frontier consciousness and

Page liv
their strain on the frontier skills were formidable, as the succeeding expeditions by
Manuel Lisa and the Astorians amply attest. But there is only a single, momentary
lapse in the company's morale, when food fails in the Bitterroots. Running the
Columbia rapids in cottonwood dugouts required both skill and courage in the
greatest measure, all the more so because not even Cruzatte had ever seen such
water, but it is done with entire nonchalance. The same unhesitating confidence in
the presence of the unknown and unpredictable can be seen in the decision to strike
for the Nez Percé trail when, at Lemhi Pass, they learn that they cannot go down
either the Salmon or its banks.
In such episodes certain elements of the wilderness mind reach their highest
expression; there are other elements as well. Lewis and Clark exercised a constant
but untroubled vigilance. (Nevertheless, they lapsed from it several times, notably at
Fort Mandan, when they failed to send with the detail that was to bring in the meat
an escort strong enough to keep the Sioux respectful, and when Lewis went to sleep
in the presence of the Blackfeet.) Success in a strange country required a curious
mixture of open-mindedness and skepticism, capable of adjusting accepted ideas
and practices to unfamiliar conditions. It required too both an analytical and an
intuitive understanding of geography. Just as Lewis had to amend his disparagement
of a grizzly's toughness, so they both had repeatedly to amend their prepossessions
and especially their assumptions about the country. The discovery that the Missouri
forked at a place where they were not expecting a tributary was a stunning shock.
Forthwith they determined that the northern fork, the Marias, was not the Missouri
proper, and this determination is a remarkable act of thought, unsurpassed in the
annals of exploration in the New World. Yet this analysis of fact, appearance, and
evidence, and the empirical demonstration that proved it right, merely confirmed
conclusions that both Lewis and Clark reached in the first hour or two. Similarly,
Clark knew at once on reaching the main stream of the Clearwater River that it was a
part of the same river system as the Salmon River, from whose impassable canyon
they had turned back. Lewis clearly ranks with Thompson and Mackenzie as a
geographer but Clark had geographical genius.
Ingenuity and resourcefulness in the field are so continuous that a casual reader may
not notice them. The portage round the Great

Page lv
Falls is a remarkable achievement in all respects, from Clark's survey of the best
route to the construction of the crude truck with which the outfit was transported.
Perhaps, however, such mastery is to be expected from experienced frontiersmen,
who had to be adept at contriving expedients or they did not last to become
experienced. What is altogether beyond expectation, and beyond praise too, is the
captains' management of the Indians they met. In personal dealings with them they
made no mistakes at all. In so much that at the critical points it is impossible to
imagine a more successful outcome or a better way of achieving it, whereas it is
easy to instance similar occasions when less skillful men failed badly. With the Sioux
they were always firm, always clearly incapable of being scared or bluffed, amiable or
threatening or defiant to precisely the right degree at precisely the right moments.
As a result they won a considerable victory for the international relations of the
United States. This triumph served them well with the village tribes farther up the
river. But with these tribes, as with those farther west, other qualities as well
contributed to their remarkable success. They were obviously unawed and unafraid,
but they were also obviously friendly and fair, scrupulously honest, interested,
understanding, courteous, and respectful. That last quality must be insisted on, for
rare as honesty and fairness were in the white American's dealing with Indians, they
were commoner than respect. Lewis and Clark respected the Indians' personal
dignity, their rituals, their taboos, their religious thinking, indeed the full content of
their thought. They understood that thought so well that they must be ranked among
the masters of primitive psychology. Finally there was the simple fact that they, and
Clark especially, liked Indians. All this being true, they required a similar attitude
from their command.
It paid off. They had no trouble with most tribes, after the Sioux none at all till they
reached the decadent, thievish people of the lower Columbia, who had been
debauched by the maritime trade, and no difficulty they had with them even
threatened to get out of hand.16 They attached the Nez Percés and the Flatheads to
the
16 These tribes had indeed been corrupted by the debauchery, brutality, and
terrorism of the Northwest trade, but they were the fringe tribes of their
culture group and it seems to be true that they had started on a cultural
decline before the arrival of the trade.

Page lvi
American interest permanently. Both tribes were fortunate beyond most others in the
missionaries visited on them when the period of Christianizing the Western Indians
began,17 and in the fact that their countries, especially that of the Flatheads, were
distant from the area of early settlement. But their loyalty was created by Lewis and
Clark. The Flatheads never did commit a hostile act of any consequence, and when
one of the most flagrant land-steals in the annals of Indian land-steals was
perpetrated, they submitted with bitter fatalism. The Nez Percés accepted great
indignity over a long time. When at last an altogether atrocious injustice moved their
great man, Chief Joseph, to lead one band of them in a running fight toward a
decenter country, he said truthfully that up to that time they not only had never
attacked a white man, they had never been offensive to one. (When in the course of
the great march Joseph's forces approached the Bitterroot Valley, the Flatheads
announced a policy of noninterference, and though they connived at the sale of
ammunition to the retreaters they also quietly took measures to protect the white
men who had settled in their country and were appropriating it.) The expedition did
not win any other tribes so permanently as these, but it established so great a good
will as to make the early years of the fur trade era a good deal less violent than they
could possibly have been without it.
This climate of approval extended far beyond the tribes which the expedition actually
met and it made a kind of culture hero of William Clark. All the Plains and Northwest
tribes knew of the Red Headed Chief and came to depend on him for friendship and,
if not justice, at least advocacy. He was the white man whose tongue was straight,
our elder brother. Miracles were expected of him, indeed he was able to perform
miracles on their behalf, but if he had been able to obtain for them any substantial
measure of justice it would have been a transcendent miracle. He did what he could;
he was able to procure occasional decencies and often able to prevent or moderate
indecencies and he accomplished more for the Indians than anyone else in Western
history. If a delegation of Indians went to St. Louis, it sought out Clark first of all; if a
fur company sent a brigade up the Missouri or into the mountains, it provided itself
with a passport in the form of messages and greet17 Henry Spalding and Father de Smet.

Page lvii
ings from Clark. If the U.S. government had to send an embassy to the Indian
country it began by trying to get Clark to accompany it, and if Clark consented he
was invariably able to get fairer treatment for the Indians and more amenable
behavior from them. This subsequent function is a bright strand in a dark history. It
has had less attention than it deserves from those who write history; sometime it
should be described in detail.
7
Creating such a predisposition, however, insecure, in the Far West must be
accounted one of the important results of the Lewis and Clark expedition. Those
results were so numerous that little can be said about them in an introduction but
they must be characterized. They were of various orders of immediacy and
significance.
The first major achievement was the demonstration that the last area of North
America in which a commercially practicable water route to the Pacific might exist did
not contain one. In the long arc of history this ended the search for the Northwest
Passage. And ending that chapter, it closed the volume which opened with the first
voyage of Columbus.
Lewis's reluctance to accept the fact which his journey had demonstrated, attested in
two of his reports of Jefferson, strikingly signalizes the intensity of the hope.
Nevertheless the demonstration was immediately accepted by commercial interests
to which an inland water route would have been supremely important. When John
Jacob Astor organized a fur company to fulfill the commercial (and incidentally the
political) vision of Jefferson, he based the organization solidly on salt-water
transport, though he also sent an overland expedition to reconnoiter other areas and
to check the results of Lewis and Clark. But unquestioning acceptance of those
results was among the reasons why his partisan, Wilson Price Hunt, abandoned the
Upper Missouri route and crossed to the south of it.
With the transcontinental water route, Jefferson's hope of engrossing the Canadian
fur trade, or at least its carriage, disappeared too. It was not a realistic hope
anyway, even if such a route had existed, but on the other hand in the outcome this
potential wealth was not missed. Lewis and Clark established that the

Page lviii
American West was a treasury of beaver and its exploitation began at once. The
amazing solitary pair of trappers whom they met near the mouth of the Yellowstone
in 1806, Dixon and Handcock, were the portents that heralded developments to
come. St. Louis capital was behind the venture of Manuel Lisa the next year, 1807.
Lisa hired three of the expedition's veterans, Drewyer, Potts, and Wiser, and meeting
Colter on his way downriver from his winter with the forerunners, persuaded him too
to return to the fur country. Lisa's first Missouri voyage is the beginning of the
Western fur trade, and he was bound for the fields that Lewis and Clark had most
highly recommended, the Three Forks and the valley of the Yellowstone. The
Western trade, roughly divided between two regions, the Upper Missouri and the
Rocky Mountains, was continuous thenceforward and steadily increased in
importance till the break in beaver prices toward the end of the 1830's. The
''mountain men" whom the trade developed completed the exploration of the West
that Lewis and Clark had begun.
It may be that to secure the Columbia country Oregon was the earliest as it was
certainly the most urgent of Jefferson's purposes. The expedition served it vitally; in
fact, one is justified in saying, decisively. The land traverse bolstered the claim
established by Robert Gray's discovery and was of equal or greater legal importance;
in international policy the two combined to give the United States not only a prior but
a paramount claim. More, it was the journey of Lewis and Clark that gave the
American people a conviction that Oregon was theirs and this conviction was more
important than the claim. And pragmatically, the establishment of Fort Astoria by
Astor's party won the British-American race to the Pacific. Astor's American Fur
Company and Pacific Fur Company were established not only as a result of the
expedition's reports but in exact accordance with Lewis's analysis of the practices
required.
Here we may glance at a map. The route of the Western emigration was to be that of
the Platte Valley, pioneered in 1824 and 1825 by William Ashley and his subordinates
when the Arikaras tried their hand at closing the Missouri. The emigration had to be
by land travel; distances and geographical conditions necessitated it. They also made
the Platte Valley the route of the Pacific Railroad. Nevertheless, despite the
circuitousness of the

Page lix
Missouri and the hazards and difficulties of traveling it by boat it remained an
important route to the West, the Rockies, and the Northwest till the end of the
steamboat age. And the railroads which ended that age on the Missouri followed its
valley, and beyond it, in great part followed the route of Lewis and Clark to the
Northwest. How minutely the expedition pioneered one main course of American
economic development a list of names reveals at once: Kansas City, Leavenworth,
St. Joseph, Atchison, Omaha, Council Bluffs, Sioux City, Yankton, Pierre, Bismarck,
Williston, Miles City, Billings, Bozeman, Fort Benton, Great Falls, Helena, Dillon,
Salmon, Missoula, Lewiston, Walla Walla, Portland, Astoria.
A century and a half later, it is still impossible to make a satisfactory statement about
the scientific results of the expedition: qualified scientists and historians have not
been interested in making the requisite studies. Lewis's untimely death in 180918
prolonged the already serious delay in the issuance of a detailed official account of
the expedition. Unquestionably he would have written one if he had lived and he was
in a better position to formulate findings than Biddle, who wrote the invaluable
History. As it is, the only ''literary" results that were not indirect are anthropological.
The voluminous notes on Indian tribes, mainly by Lewis, which were sent to the War
Department from the Mandan villages in 1805, were codified and tabulated and
published as "A Statistical View of the Indian Nations Inhabiting the Territory of
Louisiana . . ."19 This report was at once immensely important and, as the first
survey of the trans-Mississippi tribes, is permanently important.
The "Statistical View" defines the nature of Biddle's History, through which mainly
the "literary" purposes of the expedition were fulfilled. Lewis's carefully assembled
Indian vocabularies were lost but Biddle worked into narrative an enormous amount
18 He died in a squalid roadside cabin, used as an ordinary, in frontier
Tennessee. He was en route from St. Louis to Washington to cope with snarls
of red tape which, from political motives, had brought his official accounts into
question. (He was Governor of Louisiana Territory.) The circumstances of the
mysterious affair strongly suggest murder but Jefferson, who knew that he
was subject to fits of depression, believed that he had committed suicide and it
is clear that he was in a very nervous state when he left St. Louis.
19American State Papers, Indian Affairs, No. 113, 9th Cong., 1st Sess.

of the information about Indians that the journals contained. He also wrote several
extended passages of generalization, based not only on the journals but on
communications from Clark and discussions with George Shannon, and these too are
amazingly sound and useful. The History is the first detailed account, and one may
add the first reliable account of whatever length, of the Western tribes. It put a
valuable bulk of knowledge at the disposal of anyone who had interest in or use for
knowledge relating to the Indians of the West. So it has always been a prime source
for anthropologists and historians.
But that, of course, is true of much more than anthropology. History is not so
divisible as to permit us to say exactly how important the Lewis and Clark expedition
was in securing Oregon, as a physical possession, to the United States, though its
paramount importance is self-evident. But it gave not only Oregon but the entire
West to the American people as something with which the mind could deal. The
westering people had crossed the Mississippi with the Louisiana Purchase and by that
act had acquired the manifest destiny of going on to the Pacific. But the entire
wilderness expanse, more than twice the size of the United States at the beginning of
Jefferson's administration, was a blank, not only on the map but in human thought.
It was an area of rumor, guess, and fantasy. Now it has been crossed by a large
party who came back and told in assimilable and trustworthy detail what a large part
of it was. Henceforth the mind could focus on reality. Here were not only the Indians
but the land itself and its conditions: river systems, valleys, mountain ranges,
claimates, flora, fauna, and a rich and varied membrane of detail relating them to
one another and to familiar experience. It was the first report on the West, on the
United States over the hill and beyond the sunset, on the province of the American
future. There has never been another so excellent or so influential. So it was rather
as a treasury of knowledge than as a great adventure story that the History became
a national and international favorite, reprinted, translated, pirated, and counterfeited.
It satisfied desire and it created desire: the desire of the westering nation.
That, the increase of our cultural heritage, the beginning of knowledge of the
American West, must be accounted the most important result of the Lewis and Clark
expedition.

Chapter I
From River Dubois to the Platte
[Biddle]
On the acquisition of Louisiana, in the year 1803, the attention of the Government of
the United States was early directed towards exploring and improving the new
territory. Accordingly, in the summer of the same year, an expedition was planned
by the President for the purpose of discovering the courses and sources of the
Missouri and the most convenient water communication thence to the Pacific ocean.
His private secretary, captain Meriwether Lewis, and captain William Clarke [Biddle's
misspelling], both officers of the army of the United States, were associated in the
command of this enterprize. After receiving the requisite instructions, captain Lewis
left the seat of government and, being joined by captain Clarke at Louisville, in
Kentucky, proceeded to St. Louis, where they arrived in the month of December.
Their original intention was to pass the winter at La Charrette, the highest settlement
on the Missouri. But the Spanish commandant of the province, not having received
an official account of its transfer to the United States, was obliged by the general
policy of his government to prevent strangers from passing through the Spanish
territory. They therefore encamped at the mouth of Wood River on the eastern side
of the Mississippi, out of his jurisdiction, where they passed the winter in disciplining
the men and making the necessary preparations for setting out early in the Spring,
before which the cession was officially announced.
The party consisted of: nine young men from Kentucky; 14 soldiers of the United
States Army, who volunteered their services; two French watermen [Cruzatte,
Labiche]; and interpreter and hunter [Drewyer]; and a black servant [York]
belonging to captain

Page 2

Clarke. All these except the last were enlisted to serve as privates during the
expedition, and three sergeants appointed from amongst them by the captains
[Ordway, Pryor, and Floyd]. In addition to these were engaged a corporal and six
soldiers, and nine watermen, to accompany the expedition as far as the Mandan
nation, in order to assist in carrying the stores or repelling an attack, which was
most to be apprehended between Wood River and that tribe. The party was to
embark on board of three boats; the first was a keelboat fifty-five feet long, drawing
three feet of water, carrying one large squaresail and twenty-two oars. A deck of ten
feet in the bow and stern formed a forecastle and cabin, while the middle was
covered by lockers, which might be raised so as to form a breastwork in case of
attack. This was accompanied by two perioques [pirogues] or open boats, one of six
and the other of seven oars. Two horses were at the same time to be led along the
banks of the river for the purpose of bringing home game or hunting in case of
scarcity.

Clark, being the better riverman, is usually on the boat, Lewis usually on shore,
hunting and making notes on topography, flora and fauna. The expert Drewyer and
from two to five others are usually on shore too, hunting; frequently some of them
are away overnight. On May 27 they pass the mouth of the Gasconade
1 Régis Loisel, an experienced St. Louis trader who had succeeded to the
Missouri Company, the principal effort made during the 1790's to establish
trade with the Mandans and explore the Upper Missouri. His first upriver
venture, in (probably) 1800, was (probably) frustrated by the Sioux. In 1801
he entered into a kind of partnership with Hugh Heney, whom the expedition
will meet later on. In 1802 he built the trading post here alluded to on Cedar
Island, just above the Grand Detour. He returned to it in 1803 and during the
following winter suffered many indignities and much financial loss at the hands
of the Sioux. On starting downriver, he had instructed his principal assistant,
Tabeau (of whom the captains had heard in St. Louis), to push on with seven
men to the Arikaras.
Though Clark gives no evidence that he was aware of it, Daniel Boone, now
seventy years old, was living either at La Charrette or a few miles below it on

Concluded to Camp for the night, those people inform nothing of much information.
Concluded to take old Durioun back as fur as the Soux nation with a view to get

2 Pierre Dorion was a St. Louis trader who had many years of experience with
the Yankton Sioux on the Des Moines and James Rivers. Competitors accused
him of the violence and dishonesty that were commonplace in the fur trade.
His marked success with the Sioux rested in his courage: they simply could not
bully him. Marrying a Yankton woman, he became the father of Pierre Dorion,
Jr., whom the expedition presently meets. The younger Dorion's Iowa wife,
Marie Aioë, was to be the heroine of the Astorian expedition.

It is full summer on the Missouri, which means ferocious heat broken by sudden,
violent storms. Storms endanger the boats; so do the many snags past some of
which they have to be towed by handline, an operation made risky by the swiftness
of the current. "Mosquitoes and Ticks are noumerous & bad," but all the diarists
repeatedly remark on the beauty and richness of the land. On June 26 they reach the
mouth of the Kansas River, the future site of Westport Landing and Kansas City.

It is worthey of observation to mention that our Party has been much healthier on
the Voyage than parties of the same number is in any other Situation. Tumers have
been troublesome to them all.
From this evenings encampment a man may walk to the Pani [Pawnee] Village on the

The Situation of our last Camp Councile Bluff2 or Handsom Prarie, (25 Days from

set out late this morning wind from the North. at 1 oClock dispatched George
Drewyer, R. Fields, Wm. Bratten & Wm. Labieche back after the Deserter reed with
order if he did not give up Peaceibly to put him to Death &c. to go to the Ottoes
Village & enquire for La Liberty and bring him to the Mahar Village also with a Speech
on the occasion to the Ottoes & Missouries, and derecting a few of their Chiefs to
come to the Mahars, & we would make a peace between them & the Mahars and
Souex, a String of Wompom & a Carrot of Tobacco. proceeded on and Camped on
the S. S.
The expedition proceeds slowly upriver, awaiting word from the parties sent to
overtake the deserters and to invite the Otos to a council. Note that whereas Reed
was an enlisted man, La Liberté was an employe, a member of Deschamps' boat
crew. The Omahas, who now engage the captains' attention, had been driven out of
Iowa by the westward migration of the Sioux. They were an active and belligerent
tribe and it was they who began the practice of river-piracy on the Upper Missouri.
They stopped, plundered, or levied tribute on every trading party that reached their
country, which was in northern Nebraska. They had their brief place in the sun
under a chief named Blackbird, a notorious thug and pirate, who had learned the use
of arsenic and, obtaining it from traders, poisoned such members of his tribe as
were disposed to disagree with him. In 1802, however, an epidemic of smallpox that
swept this stretch of the river killed Blackbird and reduced the Omahas to about
three hundred. (On August 11 Clark records that he visited Blackbird's grave.)
The Poncas, who also had plundered the St. Louis traders and had suffered from the
epidemic, were closely related to the Omahas and in fact had once been a part of
the tribe.

informd. us that they Could not find the Indians, nor any fresh Sign, those people
have not returned from their Buffalow hunt. Those people haveing no houses no
Corn or anything more than the graves of their ansesters to attach them to the old
Village, Continue in purseute of the Buffalow longer than others who has greater
attachments to their native village. The ravages of the Small Pox (which Swept off
400 men & Womin & children in perpopotion) has reduced this nation not exceeding
300 men and left them to the insults of their weaker neighbours, which before was
glad to be on friendly turms with them. I am told when this fatal malady was among
them they Carried their franzey to verry extroadinary length, not only of burning
their Village, but they put their wives & children to Death with a view of their all going
together to some better Countrey. they burry their Dead on the top of high hills and
rais Mounds on the top of them. The cause or way those people took the Small Pox
is uncertain, the most Probable, from Some other nation by means of a warparty.

rebuked them verry roughly for haveing in object goods and not peace with their
neighbours. this language they did not like at first, but at length all petitioned for us
to give back the Certificate to the Big blue eyes he came forward and made a
plausible excuse, I then gave the Certificate [to] the Great Chief to bestow it to the
most Worthy, they gave it to him, we then gave them a Dram and broke up the
Council, we Showed them many Curiosities and the air gun which they were much
astonished at. those people beged much for Whiskey. Serjeant Floyd is taken verry

at three miles we landed at a Bluff where the two men Sent with the horses were
waiting with two Deer, by examonation this Bluff Contained Alum, Copperas, Cobalt,
Pyrites; a Alum Rock Soft & Sand Stone. Capt. Lewis in proveing the quality of those

Somtime but have Recovered my helth again.'' This suggests an infected
appendix which now becomes acute and perforates. Floyd's death was the only
fatality which the expedition suffered. His grave was at the site of Sioux City,
Iowa. Private Patrick Gass, who was to live longer than any other member of
the expedition, was appointed sergeant in his place.

24TH AUGUST FRIDAY 1804.
In a northerley derection from the Mouth of this Creek in an emence Plain a high Hill
is Situated, and appears of a Conic form, and by the different nations of Indians in
this quarter is Suppose to be the residence of Deavels. that they are in human form
with remarkable large heads, and about 18 Inches high, that they are very watchfull
and are arm'd with Sharp arrows with which they Can Kill at a great distance; they
are Said to kill all persons who are So hardy as to attempt to approach the hill; they
State that tradition informs them that many Indians have Suffered by these little
people, and among others three Mahar Men fell a sacrefise to their murceless fury
not many Years Sence. So Much do the Maha, Soues, Ottoes and other neighbouring
nations believe this fable, that no Consideration is Suffecient to induce them to
approach the hill.

From the Vermilion to Teton (Bad) River
[Clark] 25TH AUGUSTSATTURDAY 1804.
A cloudy morning Capt. Lewis & Myself concluded to go and See the Mound which
was Viewed with Such turror by all the different Nations in this quarter, we Selected
[nine men to go along] from the top of this High land the Countrey is leavel & open
as far as can be Seen, except Some few rises at a great Distance, and the Mound
which the Indians Call Mountain of little people or Spirits, at 4 miles we Crossed the
Creek 23 yards wide in an extensive Valley and Contined on at two miles further our
Dog was so Heeted and fatigued we was obliged [to] Send him back to the Creek, at
12 oClock we arrived at the hill Capt. Lewis much fatigued from heat the day it being
verry hot & he being in a debilitated State from the Precautions he was obliged to
take to prevent the effects of the Cobalt, & Minl Substance which had like to have
poisoned him two days ago, his want of water, and Several of the men complaining
of Great thirst, determined us to make for the first water We proceeded on to the
Place we Campd last night and Stayed all night.
The reagular form of this hill would in Some measure justify a belief that it owed its
orrigin to the hand of man; but as the earth and loos pebbles and other substances
of which it was Composed, bore an exact resemblance to the Steep Ground which
border on the Creek in its neighbourhood we concluded it was most probably the
production of nature.1
The only remarkable Charactoristic of this hill admiting it to be a natural production is
that it is insulated or Seperated a considerable distance from any other, which is
verry unusial in the natural order or disposition of the hills.

Page 24
The Surrounding Plains is open Void of Timber and leavel to a great extent, hence the
wind from whatever quarter it may blow, drives with unusial force over the naked
Plains and against this hill; the insects of various kinds are thus involuntaryly driven
to the Mound by the force of the wind, or fly to its Leeward Side for Shelter; the
Small Birds whoes food they are, Consequently resort in great numbers to this place
in Surch of them; Perticularly the Small brown Martin of which we saw a vast number
hovering on the Leward Side of the hill, when we approached it in the act of catching
those insects; they were so gentle that they did not quit the place untill we had
arrivd within a fiew feet of them.
One evidence which the Inds give for believeing this place to be the residence of
Some unusial Sperits is that they frequently discover a large assemblage of Birds
about this Mound is in my opinion a Sufficent proof to produce in the Savage Mind a
Confident belief of all the properties which they ascribe it.
from the top of this Mound we beheld a most butifull landscape; Numerous herds of
buffalow were Seen feeding in various directions; the Plain to North N. W. & N. E.
extends without interuption as far as Can be seen.
the Boat under the Comd of Serjt. Pryor proceeded on in our absence, (after jurking
the Elk I killed yesterday) Six Miles and Camped on the Larboard Side R. Fields
brought in five Deer, George Shannon Killed an Elk Buck Som rain this evening.
We Set the Praries on fire as a signal for the Soues to Come to the River.
On August 27 they pass the mouth of James River and Clark reports that George
Shannon is lost. Actually, he was traveling ahead of the boats, thinking he had fallen
behind while hunting. Shannon, the best educated of the enlisted men and the one
whom Clark was to send to Philadelphia to assist Biddle in preparing his history,
was several times separated from the party for long periods. Yet he appears to have
been an expert woodsman; he conducted himself with absolute assurance and great
skill. On this occasion John Colter, who was to become a celebrated mountain man,
was dispatched to find him; he failed to and Shannon did not come in till September
11.
The expedition was now nearing one of its prime objectives, the

Page 25
Sioux Indians. Recent comers to the Missouri and themselves driven westward by
the better-armed Chippewas, the Sioux had terrorized all the neighboring tribes.
They had also practically closed the river to St. Louis traders who were trying to
reach the Mandan villages where British traders from the Lake Winnipeg region were
believed to be doing a prosperous business. They had succeeded in establishing
themselves as trade monopolists in this region, extracting a heavy tribute in goods
from the occasional traders whom they permitted to pass Loisel and Heney during
the preceding winter, for instance. No doubt they had been encouraged in this
brigandage by the British traders on the James and Des Moines Rivers who were
their regular source of supply. Their British allegiance was well known in
Washington and it had to be broken. The Sioux must be impressed by the power and
authority of the United States, and the Missouri must be made safe for American
traders. Jefferson also hoped, idly enough, that they could be induced to keep the
peace with the other tribes.
The expedition learned that there were some Sioux bands on the James River,
whose mouth was reached on August 27, and Dorion was sent with a small escort to
invite them to a council. He returned on August 29 with his halfbreed son (also a
trader and destined to die on the Astorian expedition) and five chiefs and seventy
warriors. They belonged to the Yankton branch of the Sioux nation, which at the
moment was much more peaceably disposed than the Teton branch, and to one of
two bands which were accustomed to trade with St. Louis, not with the British. They
complained about the parsimony of St. Louis traders and regarded the presents
which the captains gave them as niggardly. But after stately ceremonies they
amiably agreed to make peace with their neighbors (Lewis and Clark were not yet
sufficiently acquainted with Plains Indians to realize how worthless the promise
was) and to accept American sovereignty. Dorion was left here with a small amount
of trade goods for presents, having been engaged to take some of the Yankton
chiefs to Washington. Lewis and Clark had been instructed to arrange for such
delegations. The purpose was to impress the Indians with the power and wealth of
white civilization and to exhort them to keep the peace with one another.
At Council Bluffs Clark had made only perfunctory ethnological notes. Now the
expedition sees the culture of the Plains Indians in detail and the notebooks fill with
descriptions of Sioux, their

Page 26
costumes, weapons, language, tribal divisions, names, customs and beliefs. Nothing
previously written about the Sioux was so accurate, thorough, or permanently
valuable.
The true terrorists, however, the Teton Sioux, were still to come. As the expedition
moved on toward them, the eroded bluffs beside the river took so regular a form
that Clark believed some of them must be fortifications built by people more ancient
than the Indians. He measured and described them in detail and made sketches of
them. A map they were using, drawn by a St. Louis trader, showed a "volcano,"
probably a burning seam of lignite, but they could not find it.
They passed the mouth of the Niobrara River, l'Eau Qui Court, on September 4. On
the 7th they saw their first prairie dogs (commonly called "barking squirrels" in the
journals) and captured one with great difficulty. Clark's description of it, probably a
summary of one by Lewis that has not come down, is often but erroneously said to
be the first ever written. Wild game, which had been plentiful from the beginning,
had now become remarkably abundant. They had seen their first antelope, which
they usually called "goats," some time before. "Great numbers of Buffalow & Elk on
the hill. . . . I saw Several foxes & Killed a Elk & 2 Deer & Squirrels the men with me
killed an Elk, 2 Deer & a Pelican . . . a great number of Grous & 3 Foxes . . . vast
herds of Baffaloe deer Elk and Antilopes were seen feeding in every direction as far
as the eye of the observer could reach . . . 8 fallow Deer 5 Common & 3 Buffalow
killed to day . . . Muskeetors verry troublesom.'' Presently they decided that the
animals they had been calling foxes were a new, smaller species of wolves; they
were, in fact, coyotes.
On September 15 they reached the mouth of the White River and so had passed the
long escarpment called Pine Ridge and entered a new geographical province, the
Missouri Plateau. Geographically, this is the beginning of the Upper Missouri. For
frontiersmen, however, it began at the mouth of the Platte.
[Lewis] MONDAY SEPTEMBER 17TH. 1804.
Having for many days past confined myself to the boat, I determined to devote this
day to amuse myself on shore with my gun and view the interior of the country lying
between the river and

Page 27

Page 28
the Corvus Creek. accordingly before sunrise I set out with six of my best hunters,
two of whom I dispatched to the lower side of Corvus creek, two with orders to hunt
the bottoms and woodland on the river, while I retained two others to accompany
me in the intermediate country. One quarter of a mile in rear of our camp which was
situated in a fine open grove of cotton wood passed a grove of plumb trees loaded
with fruit and now ripe, observed but little difference betwen this fruit and that of a
similar kind common to the Atlantic States. the trees are smaller and more thickly
set. this forrest of plumb trees garnish a plain about 20 feet more elivated than that
on which we were encamped; this plane extends with the same bredth from the
creek below to the distance of near three miles above parrallel with the river, and it is
intirely occupyed by the burrows of the barking squiril heretofore described; this
anamal appears here in infinite numbers and the shortness and virdue of grass gave
the plain the appearance throughout it's whole extent of beatifull bowling-green in
fine order. it's aspect is S. E. a great number of wolves of the small kind, halks
[hawks] and some pole-cats were to be seen. I presume that those anamals feed on
this squirril. found the country in every direction for about three miles intersected
with deep revenes and steep irregular hills of 100 to 200 feet high; at the tops of
these hills the country breakes of as usual into a fine leavel plain extending as far as
the eye can reach. from this plane I had an extensive view of the river below, and
the irregular hills which border the opposite sides of the river and creek. the
surrounding country had been birnt about a month before and young grass had now
sprung up to hight of 4 Inches presenting the live green of the spring to the West a
high range of hills, strech across the country from N. to S. and appeared distant
about 20 miles; they are not very extensive as I could plainly observe their rise and
termination no rock appeared on them and the sides were covered with virdue
similar to that of the plains this senery already rich pleasing and beatiful was still
farther hightened by immence herds of Buffaloe, deer Elk and Antelopes which we
saw in every direction feeding on the hills and plains. I do not think I exagerate when
I estimate the number of Buffaloe which could be compre[hend]ed at one view to
amount to 3000. my object was if possible to kill a female Antelope having already
procured a male;

Page 29
I pursued my rout on this plain to the west flanked by my two hunters untill eight in
the morning when I made the signal for them to come to me which they did shortly
after. We rested our selves about half an hour, and regailed ourselves on half a
bisquit each and some jirks of Elk which we had taken the precaution to put in our
pouches in the morning before we set out, and drank of the water of a small pool
which had collected on this plain from the rains which had fallen some days before.
we had now after various windings in pursuit of several herds of antelopes which we
had seen on our way made the distance of about eight miles from our camp. we
found the Antelope extreemly shye and watchfull insomuch that we had been unable
to get a shot at them; I had this day an opportunity of witnessing the agility and the
superior fleetness of this anamal which was to me really astonishing. I had pursued
and twice surprised a small herd of seven, in the first instance they did not discover
me distinctly and therefore did not run at full speed, tho' they took care before they
rested to gain an elivated point where it was impossible to approach them under
cover, except in one direction and that happened to be in the direction from which
the wind blew towards them; bad as the chance to approach them was, I made the
best of my way towards them, freqeuntly peeping over the ridge with which I took
care to conceal myself from their view the male, of which there was but one,
frequently incircled the summit of the hill on which the females stood in a group, as if
to look out for the approach of danger. I got within about 200 paces of them when
they smelt me and fled; I gained the top of the eminence on which they stood, as
soon as possible from whence I had an extensive view of the country the antilopes
which had disappeared in a steep reveene now appeared at the distance of about
three miles on the side of a ridge which passed obliquely across me and extended
about four miles. so soon had these antelopes gained the distance at which they had
again appeared to my view I doubted at ferst that they were the same that I had just
surprised, but my doubts soon vanished when I beheld the rapidity of their flight
along the ridge before me it appeared reather the rappid flight of birds than the
motion of quadrupeds. I think I can safely venture the asscertion that the speed of
this anamal is equal if not superior to that of the finest blooded courser.

at half past one o'clock this morning the Sand bar on which we Camped began to
under mind and give way which allarmed the Serjeant on Guard, the motion of the

Chapter IV
From Teton River to the Mandans
September 25 and the succeeding three days marked the first crisis of the
expedition and its first climax. At St. Louis the captains had been thoroughly
informed about the terrorism which the Upper Missouri Indians, including the
Omahas and the Arikaras but most especially the Sioux, had been exercising on
French and Spanish traders ever since they first tried to reach the upriver tribes,
early in the 1790's. They expected trouble with the Sioux and were prepared for it;
they knew, too, that assertion of American authority and sovereignty was absolutely
essential to both the domestic and the foreign policy of the United States.
The Teton Sioux had usually stopped upriver trading parties altogether and forced
them to dispose of their goods at ruinously low prices which the Sioux themselves
set and which amounted to little more than robbery. Occasionally, however, after
levying exorbitant tribute, they had permitted parties to go on. The latest of these
victims was Régis Loisel, whom the expedition met coming down the river three
days out from St. Charles, on May 24. Loisel had suffered extreme humiliation from
the same Indians whom the expedition now met, especially the one named The
Partisan. When he went back to St. Louis, he sent his clerk, Pierre-Antoine Tabeau
(whom the expedition presently meets), on to the Arikara village, where a few
months before the arrival of Lewis and Clark he had been viciously bullied and
robbed. The Arikaras were themselves victims of the Sioux, a displaced people who
had been forced, nine years earlier, to abandon their village (near where the
expedition now met the Tetons) and withdraw out of reach farther up the river.

Page 34
As the text shows at once, the tactics which had made the French and Spanish
traders from St. Louis impotent did not work with the Americans. At any time during
these four days any willingness to temporize, any weakness or fright, or any lapse
of vigilance would have produced either fighting or failure or both. But the captains
were prepared and were not afraid. The Sioux perceived this and understood it:
these white men would fight, they could not be made to yield. So large a band of
Indians they numbered several hundred and additional ones kept coming in could
easily have massacred the party. A great many of them, however, would have been
killed and such a loss was a price which they would not pay, which no Indians would
pay, even for control of the river and a trade monopoly. According to the Indian
conception of warfare, you did not attack a well-armed and resolute enemy. You
tried bluff, bluster, and threats. If they did not work you tried diplomacy and guile,
as on the second and third day here. If they did not work, either, you postponed
matters in hope of a more favorable opportunity.
Throughout these four days the tension was so great that Clark did not sleep. It rose
to extremity twice. On September 25, in the first moment of pressure, the young
men, always the most belligerent and foolhardy, strung their bows, equivalent to
loading and cocking a rifle. The white man's nerve was intended to fail right there. It
did not. And observe that, with rifles trained on them from the keelboat, the Sioux
did not notch their arrows. Again on the 28th when an attempt was made to prevent
the final departure, the furious Clark, barely controlling himself, seized ''the port
fire," prepared to discharge the swivel. Indian bluster immediately collapsed and
from then on the terrible Tetons were mere beggars.
The moral of the episode was that a new breed of white men had come to the Upper
Missouri, one that could not be scared or bullied. The moral was flashed along the
Indian underground faster than the expedition traveled. It explains why the captains
were received with such solicitous respect by the Arikaras, who had so recently
terrorized Tabeau. It probably explains why, the following summer, the expedition
met no Indians between the Mandan villages and the Continental Divide.
In fact, the career of the Sioux as river pirates ended here. After the expedition
returned to St. Louis, it was the Arikaras, not the Sioux, who made trouble for
traders bound upriver.

Page 35
When Clark speaks of Sioux "soldiers," he is referring to members of the secret,
ritualistic military societies. Here they were acting as camp police.
The entries from Ordway's journal fill gaps and clear up ambiguities in Clark's
account.

Swivels loaded well with Buck Shot [and] each of them manned. Capt Clark used
moderation with them told them that we must and would go on and would go. that
we were not Squaws. but warriers. the chief Sayed he had warriers too and if we
were to go on they would follow us and kill and take the whole of us by degrees or
that he had another party or lodge above this [and] that they were able to destroy
us. then Capt Clark told them that we were Sent by their great father the president of
the U. S. and that if they misused us that he or Capt Lewis could by writing to him
have them all distroyed as it were in a moment. they then requested that their
women and children See the Boat as they never Saw Such a one, the Capt told them
that we could not go far as the day was far Spent, but we would let them see that
they Should not Stop us and that we Should go a Short distance and can Camp for
the night. the chief then let go the Cable and Sayed that he was Sorry to have us Go

he did not think we were Marchants, nor that we were loaded with Goods, but he
was Sorry to have us leave them So Soon they wished to come on board Capt Clark

Comeing too Capt. Lewis & 5 men went on Shore with the Cheifs, who appeared
disposed to make up & be friendly, after Captain Lewis had been on Shore about 3

his treatment which he reported was friendly, & they were prepareing for a Dance

27TH OF SEPT. THURSDAY 1804
I rose early after a bad nights Sleep found the Chief[s] all up, and the bank as useal
lined with Spectators we gave the 2 great Cheifs a Blanket a peace, or rether they
took off agreeable to their Custom the one they lay on and each one Peck of corn.
after Brackfast Capt. Lewis & the Cheifs went on Shore, as a verry large part of their
nation was comeing in, the Disposition of whome I did not know one of us being
sufficent on Shore, I wrote a letter to Mr. P. Durion & prepared a meadel & Some
Comsns. (Certifiates) & Sent to Cap Lewis at 2 oClock Capt. Lewis Returned with 4

Page 41
Chiefs & a Brave Man named War cha pa or on his Guard when the friends of those
people die they run arrows through their flesh above and below their elbows as a
testimony of their Greaf.
after Staying about half an hour, I went with them on Shore, Those men left the boat
with reluctience, I went first to the 2d Cheifs Lodge, where a croud came around
after Speeking on various Subjects I went to a princpal mans lodge from them to the
grand Chiefs lodge, after a fiew minits he invited me to a Lodge within the Circle in
which I Stayed with all their principal Men until the Dance began, which was Similer
to the one of last night performed by their women with poles on which Scalps of their
enemies were hung, Some with the Guns Spears & War empliments of their
husbands in their hands.
Capt. Lewis Came on Shore and we Continued until we were Sleepy & returned to
our boat, the 2nd Chief & one principal Man accompanied us, Those two Indians
accompanied me on board in the Small Perogue; Capt. Lewis with a guard Still on
Shore the man who Steered not being much acustomed to Steer, passed the bow of
the boat & the peroge Came broad Side against the Cable & broke it which obliged
me to order in a loud voice all hands up & at their ores, my preemptry order to the
men and the bustle of their getting to their ores allarmd. the Cheifs, together with
the appearance of the Men on Shore, as the boat turnd. The Cheif hollowaed &
allarmed the Camp or Town informing them that the Mahars was about attacking us
(them). In about 10 minits the bank was lined with men armed the 1st Cheif at their
head, about 200 men appeared and after about 1/2 hour returned all but about 60
men who continued on the bank all night, the Cheifs Contd. all night with us. This
allarm I as well as Capt. Lewis Considered as the Signal of their intentions (which
was to Stop our proceeding on our journey and if Possible rob us) we were on our
Guard all night, the misfortune of the loss of our Anchor obliged us to Lay under a
falling bank much exposd. to the accomplishment of their hostile intentions. P. C.
[Cruzatte] our Bowman who cd. Speek Mahar informed us in the night that the Maha
Prisoners informed him we were to be Stoped. we Shew as little Sighns of a

Boat and the chief then went out and Sayed we are sorry to have you go. But if you
will Give us one carret of tobacco we will be willing for you to go on & will not try to

Chapter V
Among the Mandans
When the Mandans were first seen by white men Vérendrye in 1738 they were living
in nine populous villages near the mouth of Heart River. (Mandan and Bismarck,
North Dakota, about sixty miles downstream from where Lewis and Clark
encountered them.) Cultural decline, the endless war with the Sioux, and especially
the smallpox epidemic of 1782 so reduced their strength that they were forced to
withdraw upstream, out of the path of the Sioux migration. This removal was made,
apparently, about 1790.
Knife River enters the Missouri from the west at Stanton, North Dakota. In this
vicinity were located the two villages that were ample to contain the remaining
Mandans and three villages of Minnetarees or Gros Ventres. (Rather two villages of
Minnetarees and one of their close relatives who maintained a separate tribal
organization, the Indians called by Lewis and Clark the Anahaways or Wattersoons.)
The first Mandan village was on the right or west bank (Clark calls it the south bank)
of the Missouri about four miles below the mouth of Knife River. The captains
rendered its name Matootonha and that of its principal chief, Shahaka, Big White; its
second chief was Little Raven or Little Crow. The second Mandan village, some three
miles farther upstream and on the left or east (Clark's north) bank, was in the
captains' spelling Rooptarhe. Its principal chief was Posecopsahe, Black Cat.
A mile beyond Rooptarhe, Knife River entered, and here on the right bank of the
Missouri was the small village of the Anahaways. Clark rendered its name Maharha
and that of its chief,

Page 58
White Buffalo Robe. Half a mile up Knife River from the mouth was the first
Minnetaree village, Metehartan, whose head chief was Black Moccasin. Clark does
not give a name for the second Minnetaree village, which was a mile and a half up
Knife River from the first one, but calls the head chief Little Wolf's Medicine.
These villages, which were surrounded by walled embankments of clay and a ditch,
were composed of the earth lodge typical of the Upper Missouri sedentary tribes.
The lodges, made of timber, half sunk in the ground, and covered with a thick roof
of earth, were large enough to house several families, their best buffalohorses, and
large stocks of food. They were very comfortable dwellings and were entirely safe
against marauding Sioux.1
The structure of cottonwood logs which the expedition built to winter in and which
was called Fort Mandan, was about a mile downstream from the first Mandan town.
It was in the river bottom on the opposite, that is the left, bank.

back the french hands. after the Council we gave the presents with much serimoney,

narrowly escaped the flame. a boy half white was saved unhurt in the midst of the

thrown over him by his mother who perhaps had more fore Sight for the pertection

[Biddle] OCTOBER 31ST
A second chief arrived this morning with an invitation from the grand chief of the
Mandans to come to his village, where he wished to present some corn to us and to
speak with us. Captain Clarke walked down to his village; he was first seated with
great ceremony on a robe by the side of the chief, who then threw over his
shoulders another robe handsomely ornamented. The pipe was then smoked with
several of the old men who were seated around the chief; after some time he began
his discourse by observing that he believed what we had told him, and that they
should soon enjoy peace, which would gratify him as well as his people, because
they could then hunt without fear of being attacked, and the women might work in
the fields without looking every moment for the enemy, and at night put off their
moccasins, a phrase by which is conveyed the idea of security when the women
could undress at night without fear of attack. As to the Ricaras, he continued, in
order to show you that we wish peace with all men, that chief, pointing to his second
chief, will go with some warriors back to the Ricaras with their chief now here and
smoke with that nation. When we heard of your coming all the nations around
returned from their hunting to see you, in hopes of receiving large presents; all are
disappointed and some discontented; for his part he was not much so, though his
village was. He added that he would go and see his great father the President. Two
of the steel traps stolen from the Frenchmen were then laid before Captain Clarke,
and the women brought about twelve bushels of corn. After the chief had finished,
Captain Clarke made an answer to the speech and then returned to the boat.

9 This is a specimen of the information which Lewis and Clark continued to get all
winter long from the Mandans and the Minnetarees. By the time they resumed the
journey they had far more and better information about the near-by and distant
tribes and about the geography of the West than white men had ever had before.

the Black Cat, came to see us, he made great inquiries respecting our fashions, he
also Stated the Situation of their nation, he mentioned that a Council had been held
the day before and it was thought advisable to put up with the resent insults of the
Ossiniboins & Christinoes [Crees] untill they were convinced that what had been told
them by us, Mr. Evins10 had deceived them & we might also, he promised to return
& furnish them with guns & amunition, we advised them to remain at peace & that
they might depend upon Getting Supplies through the Channel of the Missourie, but
it required time to put the trade in opperation. The Ossiniboins &c. have the trade of
those [these] nations in their power and treat them badly, as the Soux does the
Ricarees, and they cannot resent, for fear of loseing their trade.
[Biddle] NOVEMBER 20TH.
We this day moved into our huts which are now completed. This place which we call
Fort Mandan, is situated in a point of low ground, on the north side of the Missouri,
covered with tall and heavy cottonwood. The works consist of two rows of huts or
sheds, forming an angle where they joined each other; each row containing four
rooms, of 14 feet square and 7 feet high, with plank cieling, and the roof slanting so
as to form a loft above the rooms, the highest part of which is 18 feet from the
ground: the backs of the huts formed a wall of that height, and opposite the angle
the place of the wall was supplied by picketing: in the area were two rooms for
stores and provisions. The latitude by observation is 47° 21' 47'', and the computed
distance from the mouth of the Missouri is sixteen hundred miles.

villages into American hands. The Indians are saying that they hope they can
depend on the Americans' promise to supply them with plenty of goods but
they had believed Evans when he made the same promise and he did not keep
it.

Page 67
In the course of the day several Indians came down to partake of our fresh meat;
among the rest, three chiefs of the second Mandan village. They inform us that the
Sioux on the Missouri about the Chayenne river, threaten to attack them this winter;
that these Sioux are much irritated at the Ricaras for having made peace through our
means with the Mandans, and have lately ill-treated three Ricaras who carried the
pipe of peace to them, by beating them and taking away their horses. We gave them
assurances that we would protect them from all their enemies.
[Clark] 22ND OF NOVEMBER THURSDAY 1804
I was allarmed about 10 oClock by the Sentinal, who informed that an Indian was
about to kill his wife in the interpeters fire about 60 yards below the works, I went
down and Spoke to the fellow about the rash act which he was like to commit and
forbid any act of the kind near the fort. Some misunderstanding took place between
this man & his fife [wife] about 8 days ago, and she came to this place, & continued
with the Squars of the interpeters, (he might lawfully have killed her for running
away) 2 days ago She returned to the vill'ge. in the evening of the Same day She
came to the interpeters fire appearently much beat, & Stabed in 3 places. We
Derected that no man of this party have any intercourse with this woman under the
penalty of Punishment. he the Husband observed that one of our Serjeants Slept
with his wife & if he wanted her he would give her to him, We derected the Serjeant
[Ordway] to give the man Some articles, at which time I told the Indian that I
believed not one man of the party had touched his wife except the one he had given
the use of her for a nite, in his own bed, no man of the party Should touch his squar,
or the wife of any Indian, nor did I believe they touch a woman if they knew her to
be the wife of another man, and advised him to take his squar home and live hapily
together in future,

Capt. Lewis returned from the Villages with two Chiefs & a considerate [considerable]
man with the party who accompanied him, The Menetaries, were allarmed at the
tales told them by the Mandans viz: that we intended to join the Seaux to Cut off
them in the Course of the Winter, many Circumstances Combin'd to give force to
those reports i.e. the movements of the interpeters & their families to the Fort, the
strength of our work &c &c. all those reports was contredicted by Capt. Lewis with a
conviction on the minds of the Indians of the falsity of those reports. Seven Traders
arrived from the fort on the Ossinoboin from the NW. Company one of which
Lafrance took upon himself to speak unfavourably of our intentions &c. the principal
Mr. La Rock (& Mr. Mc Kensey) was informed of the Conduct of their interpeter & the

them from visiting Fort Mandan till the Mandans could sew up the expected
American trade and become its middlemen. The leader of the North West
Company party was François Antoine Larocque; his clerk was Charles
MacKenzie, who felt a British superiority to the Americans and called Lewis an
anglophobe. This first contact with the Canadian trade from the Lake Winnipeg
region was an important event.

30TH OF NOVEMBER FRIDAY 1804
This morning at 8 oClock an Indian called from the other Side and informed that he

informed us as follows. Viz: ''five men of the Mandan nation out hunting in a S.W.

one man was Killed and two wounded with arrows & 9 Horses taken, 4 of the We ter

thought it well to Show a Disposition to ade and assist them against their enemies,
and I Deturmined to go to the town with Some men, and if the Seeoux were comeing
to attact the Nation to Collect the worriers from each Village and meet them, I
crossed the river in about an hour after the arrival of the Indian express with 23 men
including the interpeters and flankd the Town & came up on the back part. The
Indians not expecting to receive Such Strong aide in So Short a time was much
supprised and a littled allarmed at the formadable appearence of my party. I

the Grand Cheif to repeat the Circumstancies as they hapined, which he did as was
mentioned by the express in the morning. I then informed them that if they would
assemble their warrers and those of the Different Towns, I would [go] to meet the
Army of Souex &c. chastise them for takeing the blood of our dutifull Children &c.
after a conversation of a fiew minits amongst themselves, one Chief. Said they now

listened to what we had told them and cearlessly went out to hunt in Small parties
believing themselves to be Safe from the other nations, and have been killed by the
Panies & Seauex, "I knew Said he that the Panies were liers, and told the old Chief
who Came with you (to Confirm a piece with us) that his people were liers and bad
men and that we killed them like the Buffalow, when we pleased, we had made peace
several times and you[r] Nation have always commenced the war, we do not want to
kill you, and will not Suffer you to kill us or Steal our horses, we will make peace with
you as our two fathers have derected, and they Shall See that we will not be the
Ogressors, but we fear the Ricares will not be at peace long. My father those are the
words I spoke to the Ricare in your presents. you See they have not opened their
ears to your good Councels but have Spuilt our blood. two Ricaries whom we sent
home this day for fear of our peoples killing them in their greaf, informed us when
they came here Several days ago, that two Towns of the Ricares were makeing their
Mockersons,13 and that we had best take care of our horses &c. My father the Snow
is deep and it is cold our horses Cannot travel thro the plains, those people who
have Spilt our blood have gone back? if you will go with us in the Spring after the
Snow goes off we will raise the warriers of all the Towns & Nations around about us,
and go with you."

prevented their horses from traveling. I wished to meet those Seeoux & all others
who will not open their ears, but make war on our dutifull Children, and let you see
that the Wariers of your Great father will chastize the enimies of his dutifull Children
the Mandans, Wetersoons & Winetarees, who have opend. their ears to his advice.
after about two hours conversation on various Subjects all of which tended towards
their Situation &c. I informed them I should return to the fort, the Chief said they all
thanked me verry much for the fatherly protection which I shewed towards them,
that the village had been crying all the night and day for the death of the brave
young man, who fell but now they would wipe away their tears, and rejoice in their
fathers protection, and cry no more.

Custom the old men arrange themselves in a circle & after Smoke[ing] a pipe which
is handed them by a young man, Dress[ed] up for the purpose, the young men who
have their wives back of the Circle go [each] to one of the old men with a whining
tone and request the old man to take his wife (who presents [herself] necked except
a robe) and (or Sleep with her) the Girl then takes the Old Man (who verry often can
scarcely walk) and leades him to a convenient place for the business, after which
they return to the lodge; if the old man (or a white man) returns to the lodge without
gratifying the Man & his wife, he offers her again and again; it is often the Case that
after the 2d time without Kissing the Husband throws a new robe over the old man
&c. and begs him not to dispise him & his wife (We Sent a man to this Medisan
Dance last night, they gave him 4 Girls) all this is to cause the buffalow to Come
near So that they may Kill them

This War Chief gave us a Chart in his Way of the Missourie, he informed us of his
intentions of going to War in the Spring against the Snake Indians we advised him to
look back at the number of Nations who had been distroyed by War, and reflect upon
what he was about to do, observing if he wished the happiness of his nation, he
would be at peace with all, by that by being at peace and haveing plenty of goods
amongst them & a free intercourse with those defenceless nations, they would get
on easy tirms a greater Number of horses, and that Nation would increas, if he went
to War against those Defenceless people, he would displease his great father, and he
would not receive that pertection & care from him as other nations who listened to
his word. This Chief who is a young man 26 yr. old replied that if his going to war
against the Snake indians would be displeasing to us he would not go, he had horses
enough.2
2 Most of the information about the farther West which the captains had
received came, as this does, from the Minnetarees, who raided much farther
than the Mandans did. By now they have learned that the Snake Indians, the
Shoshones, will be crucially important to them. The great horse herds of the
Snakes will provide mounts and pack animals for the land traverse, of
uncertain length, which they will have to make to the Columbia watershed.
Charbonneau's young wife Sacajawea (possibly only sixteen years old) has
thus become unexpectedly important: she is a Snake and can speak their
language.

the situation of our boat and perogues is now allarming, they are firmly inclosed in
the Ice and almost covered with snow the ice which incloses them lyes in several
stratas of unequal thicknesses which are separated by streams of water. this [is]
peculiarly unfortunate because so soon as we cut through the first strata of ice the
water rushes up and rises as high as the upper surface of the ice and thus creates
such a debth of water as renders it impracticable to cut away the lower strata which
appears firmly attached to, and confining the bottom of the vessels. the instruments
we have hitherto used has been the ax only, with which, we have made several
attempts that proved unsuccessfull. we then determined to attempt freeing them
from the ice by means of boiling water which we purposed heating in the vessels by
means of hot stones, but this expedient proved also fruitless, as every species of
stone which we could procure in the neighbourhood partook so much of the
calcarious genus that they burst into small particles on being exposed to the heat of
the fire. we now determined as the dernier resort to

[it] from the ice.
4TH FEBRUARY, MONDAY 1805
Capt Clark set out with a hunting party consisting of sixteen of our command and
two frenchmen who together with two others, have established a small hut and
resided this winter within the vicinity of Fort Mandane under our protection. our
stock of meat which we had procured in the Months of November & December is
now nearly exhausted. Capt. Clark therefore determined to continue his rout down
the river even as far as the River bullet [Cannonball] unless he should find a plenty of
game nearer. the men transported their baggage on a couple of small wooden Slays
drawn by themselves, and took with them 3 pack horses. no buffaloe have made
their appearance in our neighbourhood for some weeks.
7TH FEBRUARY THURSDAY 1805.
The Sergt. of the guard reported that the Indian women (wives to our interpreters)
were in the habit of unbaring the fort gate at any time of night and admitting their
Indian visitors, I therefore directed a lock to be put to the gate and ordered that no
Indian but those attatched to the garrison should be permitted to remain all night
within the fort or admitted during the period which the gate had been previously
ordered to be kept shut, which was from sunset untill sunrise.

scaled the works an indian who was looking on shortly after followed his

Page 80
example. I convinced the Indian of the impropryety of his conduct, and explained to
him the risk he had run of being severely treated, the fellow appeared much
allarmed, I gave him a small piece of tobacco and sent him away Howard I had
comitted to the care of the guard with a determineation to have him tryed by a
Court-martial for this offence. this man is an old soldier which still hightens this
offince.4
11TH FEBRUARY MONDAY 1805
about five oClock this evening one of the wives of Charbono [Sacajawea] was
delivered of a fine boy. it is worthy of remark that this was the first child which this
woman had boarn, and as is common in such cases her labour was tedious and the
pain violent; Mr. Jessome informed me that he had freequently administered a small
portion of the rattle of the rattle-snake, which he assured me had never failed to
produce the desired effect, that of hastening the birth of the child; having the rattle
of a snake by me I gave it to him and he administered two rings of it to the woman
broken in small pieces with the fingers and added to a small quantity of water.
Whether this medicine was truly the cause or not I shall not undertake to determine,
but I was informed that she had not taken it more than ten minutes before she
brought forth

5 Momentous news. The XY Company, headed by the great Alexander
Mackenzie, had been providing the most violent and effective competition the
North West Company had ever had to meet. The merger meant, among other
things, a victory for Mackenzie's ideas of trade imperialism: expansion to the
Pacific, the establishment of trading posts on the Columbia, and exclusion of
the United States from the area north of 45°, which must come under British
sovereignty. The American-British race for the Columbia, which has been
already hinted at in Larocque's request to accompany the expedition West, and
which was not to end till the establishment of Fort Astoria by John Jacob
Astor's representatives, may be said to begin right here.
6 This is Le Borgne: the One-Eyed Man. He was indeed the head chief of the
Minnetarees, a ferocious, bloodthirsty, tyrannical, and entirely fearless leader,
who had terrorized Tabeau and had forced the Canadian traders to treat him with
the utmost deference. It would appear that his pro-British sentiment had kept him
from visiting Fort Mandan but that he had been unable to prevent the
development of a large pro-American faction in his tribe.

Chapter VII
From Fort Mandan to the Yellowstone
In their intercourse with representatives of the North West Company and the
Hudson's Bay Company, the captains had carefully asserted American sovereignty
over the area they were traversing and American jurisdiction over the Indians who
inhabited it, especially those immediately at hand. They had announced an American
trade policy which permitted the British to go on trading at these villages but would
subject them to competition from American companies and to the threat of
government "factories" or trading posts if that competition did not keep prices in
hand. (The British sold goods to the Upper Missouri Indians at a markup of one
hundred per cent above the prices they charged on the Assiniboine River just to the
north.) Also they had notified their visitors that the posts on the Assiniboine and the
Souris were really south of the boundary, that in fact Louisiana extended as far
north as the Qu'Appelle River, a northern affluent of the Assiniboine. This error
resulted from Lewis's incorrect determinations of latitude, from his belief that the
latitudes worked out by the North West Company's great David Thompson were
incorrect, and from a faulty understanding of the watersheds.
The constant winter occupation, however, was procuring information from the
Indians. Most of this was entered not in the daily log but in notebooks kept
separately for that purpose. The analysis and codification of data about the Indian
tribes was principally the work of Lewis. His voluminous report to Jefferson, which
was sent to the States on the returning keelboat, was the basis of Jefferson's report
to Congress which was published as "A Statistical View of the Indian Nations
Inhabiting the Territory of Louisiana,

Page 88
and the Countries Adjacent to Its Northern and Western Boundaries." Though it
contained errors and misconceptions, it was astonishingly accurate and complete,
the first and basic document in the anthropology of the Plains tribes. Just as
remarkable, perhaps more so, was the compendium of geographical data,
principally the work of Clark.
The area they were now about to cross had never been visited by white men and
was almost entirely unknown, even in guess and rumor. The information they got
about it as far west as the Continental Divide, that is was detailed and in the main
accurate. Students can examine it in Volume VI of the Journals, where it appears in
the form of tables, digests, and memoranda. Only certain parts of it are relevant to
the story of the expedition.
They were able to form an accurate conception of the Missouri's principal tributary,
the Yellowstone, and the principal rivers that flow into it. They seriously
misconceived the area of its headwaters, however; none of their Indian informants
had visited that region and the error was rooted in the theories which the St. Louis
traders had expressed to them. They achieved a clear and reliable conception of the
remainder of the Missouri, getting all its courses and big tributaries correct and
closely approximating most of the distances. They formed a clear and correct idea of
the Great Falls of the Missouri (and were the first white men to do so) and of the
nearest ranges of the Rocky Mountains, the ranges from which the river issued. One
mistake they made had serious consequences: they misjudged the distance of a
northern affluent which the Minnetarees called the River That Scolds All the Others.
(Sketching maps on strips of hide or in sand or the fireplace ashes, the Indians
would calculate distances in terms of a day's travel, so many "suns" or so many
"sleeps.") This error will be manifest when the expedition reaches the mouth of the
Marias River.
Also, they misunderstood what the Minnetarees (always their principal informants
and here the only ones) told them about the crossing of the Continental Divide of
the Rocky Mountains. The Minnetarees actually described two routes, both of which
required a sizable stretch of land travel. Both led to northward-flowing rivers which
the captains took to be a previously unsuspected southern fork of the Columbia
River, their great objective. One led west from the Great Falls to the Bitterroot River
and was short

Page 89
and easy. The other, much longer and incomparably harder travel, continued up the
Missouri to the Three Forks, crossed the Divide to the Lemhi River, and went down it
to the Salmon River. (With a northward-flowing river west of the Divide the
Minnetarees' knowledge of Western geography ended, though they amiably provided
a mass of fictitious geography.) For a number of reasons Clark and Lewis failed to
understand that they were hearing about two routes. They combined data about
both and judged that they all related to the second route.
One more point. Throughout the winter they kept inquiring about a tributary of the
Missouri, any navigable tributary, that would enter from the north after coming
down from above 49°, the (presumptive) boundary of Canada. After the expedition
started west again, they kept looking for one. This inquiry related to one of the basic
objectives that Jefferson had set for the expedition. Jefferson had reverted to the
original conception of Louisiana: that it included the entire watershed of the
Mississippi and therefore the entire watershed of the Missouri. On that basis he
argued that the basin of any affluent of the Missouri that extended north of 49° was
American and the boundary would have to loop north to include it. Such a river was
exceedingly important for Jefferson's plans. He did not know that the Upper Missouri
froze over in the winter. He counted on a northern tributary of the Missouri to
provide access to the rich fur country of the Canadian Northwest, especially the
Saskatchewan River, which was the highway to the richest of all fur countries, the
high north. If such a river could be found, then at least the carrying trade in furs
could be secured for the United States, if not the whole fur trade. For an American
route to the Atlantic seaboard would provide much faster and much cheaper
transportation than the Canadian canoe route to Montreal by way of Lake of the
Woods, Rainy Lake, the Great Lakes, and the St. Lawrence a route which was closed
by ice throughout a long winter and was made infinitely laborious by many
portages. The American route would be open and continuous: the Missouri to the
Mississippi, to the Ohio, thence by a choice of rivers to salt-water ports.
Furthermore, it would connect with the maritime trade of the Northwest coast (the
triangular trade with China based on sea otter and to be reached by the Columbia
River) and with the expected rich commerce of Asia. For Jefferson,

Page 90
in common with all other geographical thinkers (including, when they started, Lewis
and Clark), believed that there would be only a single portage, one which would
require at most less than a day, between Missouri and Columbia waters.
The Captains believed at the villages that they had learned of just such a northern
tributary of the Missouri as was desired, the one they called White Earth River. It
turned out to be a negligible creek.

[Lewis] FORT MANDAN APRIL 7TH. 1805.
Having on this day at 4. P.M. completed every arrangement necessary for our
departure, we dismissed the barge and crew with orders to return without loss of
time to St. Louis, a small canoe with two French hunters accompanyed the barge;
these men had assended the missouri with us the last year as engages. The barge
crew consisted of six soldiers and two [blank space in MS.] Frenchmen; two
Frenchmen and a Ricara Indian also take their passage in her as far as the Ricara
Vilages, at which place we expect Mr. Tiebeau to embark with his peltry who in that
case will make an addition of two, perhaps four men to the crew of the barge.2 We
gave Richard Warfington, a discharged Corpl., the charge of the Barge and crew, and
confided to his care likewise our dispatches to the government, letters to our private
friends and a number of articles to the President of the United States. One of the
Frenchmen by the Name of Gravline an honest discrete man and an excellent
boat-man is imployed to conduct the barge as a pilot; we have therefore every hope
that the barge and with her our dispatches will arrive safe at St. Louis. Mr. Gravlin
who speaks the Ricara language extreemly well, has been imployed to conduct a few
of the Recara Chiefs to the seat of government who have
1 See Appendix III for the "Sundery articles," specimens which had been
collected and carefully preserved for the President and the American
Philosophical Society. More important, however, were the letters and
voluminous reports which were sent with the keelboat.
2 Four members of Warfington's original squad accompanied him: Boley, Dame,
Tuttle, and White. Besides these he had Reed and Newman, who had been
sentenced to discharge. The latter had tried hard to regain his lost status; Lewis
respected the effort and recommended that he be given a half share of the land
bounty promised all members of the expedition, but was not willing to take into
the unknown a man who had been guilty of insubordination. Tabeau and four of
his men boarded the boat at the Arikara village. These, with Gravelines and the
two former engagés of Deschamps, brought the crew to fifteen.

Page 92
promised us to decend in the barge to St: Liwis with that view.
At the same moment that the Barge departed from Fort Mandan, Capt. Clark
emba[r]ked with our party and proceeded up the River. as I had used no exercise for
several weeks, I determined to walk on shore as far as our encampment of this
evening.
Our vessels consisted of six small canoes, and two large perogues. This little fleet
altho' not quite so rispectable as those of Columbus or Capt. Cook, were still viewed
by us with as much pleasure as those deservedly famed adventurers ever beheld
theirs; and I dare say with quite as much anxiety for their safety and preservation.
we were now about to penetrate a country at least two thousand miles in width, on
which the foot of civilized man had never trodden; the good or evil it had in store for
us was for experiment yet to determine, and these little vessells contained every
article by which we were to expect to subsist or defend ourselves. however, as the
state of mind in which we are, generally gives the colouring to events, when the
immagination is suffered to wander into futurity, the picture which now presented
itself to me was a most pleasing one. enterta[in]ing as I do, the most confident hope
of succeeding in a voyage which had formed a da[r]ling project of mine for the last
ten years, I could but esteem this moment of my departure as among the most
happy of my life. The party are in excellent health and sperits, zealously attached to
the enterprise, and anxious to proceed; not a whisper of murmur or discontent to be
heard among them, but all act in unison, and with the most perfict harmony. Capt.
Clark myself the two Interpretters and the woman and child sleep in a tent of
dressed skins.3 this tent is in the Indian stile, formed of a number of dressed
Buffaloe skins sewed together with sinues. it is cut in such manner that when foalded
double it forms the quarter of a circle, and is left open at one side here it may be
attatched or loosened at pleasure by strings which are sewed to its sides for the
purpose.

performed by penetrating the earth with a sharp stick about some small collections

of these roots. the flavor of this root resembles that of the Jerusalem Artichoke, and

considerable quantities of smoke which has a strong sulphurious smell.5 at 1. P.M.
we overtook three french hunters who had set out a few days before us with a view
of traping beaver; they had taken 12 since they left Fort Mandan. these people avail
themselves of the protection which our numbers will enable us to give them against
the Assinniboins who sometimes hunt on the Missouri; and intend ascending with us
as far as the mouth of the Yellow stone river and continue there hunt up that river.6
this is the first essay of a beaver hunter of any discription on this river [above the
villages]. the beaver these people have already taken is by far the best I have ever
seen.
[Lewis] SATURDAY APRIL 13TH
The wind was in our favour after 9 A.M. and continued favourable untill three 3. P.M.
we therefore hoisted both the sails in the White Perogue, consisting of a small squar
sail, and spritsail, which carried her at a pretty good gate, untill about 2 in the
afternoon when a sudden squall of wind struck us and turned the perogue so much
on the side as to allarm Sharbono who was steering at the time, in this state of alarm
he threw the perogue with her side to the wind, when the spritsail gibing was as near
overseting the perogue as it was possible to have missed. the wind however abating
for an instant I ordered Drewyer to the helm and the sails to be taken in, which was
instant executed and the perogue being steered before the wind was agin plased in a
state of security. this accedent was very near costing us dearly. beleiving this vessell
to be the most steady and safe, we had embarked on board of it our instruments,
Papers, medicine and the most valuable part of the merchandize which we had still in
reserve as presents for the Indians. we had also embarked on board ourselves, with
three men who could not swim and the squaw with the young child, all of whom, had
the perogue overset, would most probably have perished, as the waves were high,
and the perogue upwards of 200 yards from the nearest shore; just above the
entrance of the little Missouri the great Missouri is upwards of a mile in width,
5 St. Louis traders had reported such burning lignite as volcanos.
6 The "hunters" from either Tabeau's or Deschamps' party stayed with the
expedition for only three days.

Page 95
tho' immediately at the entrance of the former it is not more than 200 yards wide
and so shallow that the canoes passed it with seting poles.
we found a number of carcases of the Buffaloe lying along shore, which had been
drowned by falling through the ice in winter and lodged on shore by the high water
when the river broke up about the first of this month. we saw also many tracks of
the white bear of enormous size, along the river shore and about the carcases of the
Buffaloe, on which I presume they feed. we have not as yet seen one of these
anamals, tho' their tracks are so abundant and recent. the men as well as ourselves
are anxious to meet with some of these bear. the Indians give a very formidable
account of the strength and ferocity of this anamal, which they never dare to attack
but in parties of six eight or ten persons; and are even then frequently defeated with
the loss of one or more of their party. the savages attack this anamal with their bows
and arrows and the indifferent guns with which the traders furnish them, with these
they shoot with such uncertainty and at so short a distance, that (unless shot thro'
head or heart wound not mortal) they frequently mis their aim & fall a sacrefice to
the bear. this anamall is said more frequently to attack a man on meeting with him,
than to flee from him. When the Indians are about to go in quest of the white bear,
previous to their departure, they paint themselves and perform all those
supersticious rights commonly observed when they are about to make war uppon a
neighbouring nation. Oserved more bald eagles on this part of the Missouri than we
have previously seen. saw the small hawk, frequently called the sparrow hawk,
which is common to most parts of the U. States. great quantities of gees are seen
feeding in the praries. saw a large flock of white brant or gees with black wings pass
up the river; there were a number of gray brant with them.

was the highest point to which any whiteman had ever ascended, except two
Frenchmen (one of whom Lapage was now with us) who having lost their way had
straggled a few miles further tho' to what place precisely I could not learn.
[Clark] 18TH OF APRIL THURSDAY 1805
after brackfast I assended a hill and observed that the river made a great bend to the
South, I concluded to walk thro' the point about 2 miles and take Shabono, with me,
he had taken a dost of Salts &c. his squar followed on with her child, when I struck
the next bend of the [river] could see nothing of the Party, left this man & his wife &
child on the river bank and went out to hunt, Killed a young Buck Elk, & a Deer, the
Elk was tolerable meat, the Deer verry pore, Butchered the meat and continued untill
near Sunset before Capt Lewis and the party came up, they were detained by the
wind, which rose soon after I left the boat from the NW. & blew verry hard untill
verry late in the evening. Saw several old Indian camps, the game, such as Buffalow
Elk, antelopes & Deer verry plenty
19TH OF APRIL FRIDAY 1805
the wind so hard from the N.W. that we were fearfull of ventering our Canoes in the
river, lay by all day on the S. Side in a good harber, the Praries appear to Green, the
cotton trees bigin to leave, Saw some plumb bushes in full bloom, The beaver of this
river is much larger than usial, Great deal of Sign of the large Bear,
20TH OF APRIL SATTURDAY 1805
we set out at 7 oClock proceeded on, soon after we set out a Bank fell in near one of
the canoes which like to have filled her

Page 97
with water, the wind became hard and waves so rough that we proceeded with our
little canoes with much risque, our situation was such after setting out that we were
obliged to pass round the 1st Point or lay exposed to the blustering winds & waves,
in passing round the Point several canoes took in water as also our large Perogue but
without injuring our stores &c. much a short distance below our Camp I saw some
rafts on the S. S. near which, an Indian woman was scaffeled in the Indian form of
Deposing their Dead and fallen down She was or had been raised about 6 feet,
inclosed in Several robes tightly laced around her, with her dog Slays, her bag of
Different coloured earths paint small bones of animals beaver nales and Several
other little trinkets, also a blue jay, her dog was killed and lay near her. Capt. Lewis
joined me soon after I landed & informed me he had walked several miles higher, &
in his walk killed 2 Deer & wounded an Elk & a Deer, our party shot in the river four
beaver & cought two, which were verry fat and much admired by the men, after we
landed they killed 3 Elk 4 Gees & 2 Deer we had some of our Provisions &c. which
got a little wet aired, the wind continued so hard that we were compelled to delay all
day. Saw several buffalow lodged in the drift wood which had been drouned in the
winter in passing the river.
[Lewis] MONDAY APRIL 22ND 1805.
Set out at an early hour this morning; proceeded pretty well untill breakfat, when the
wind became so hard a head that we proceeded with difficulty even with the
assistance of our toe lines. the party halted and Cpt. Clark and myself walked to the
white earth river7 which approaches the Missouri very near at this place, being about
4 miles above it's entrance. we found that it contained more water than streams of
it's size generally do at this season. the water is much clearer than that of the
Missouri. the banks of the river are steep and not more than ten or twelve feet high;
the bed seems to be composed of mud altogether. the salts [alkali] which have been
before mentioned as common on the Missouri,
7 They had passed its mouth the day before. It is the creek now known as the
Little Muddy, at Williston, North Dakota. (Not to be confused with another
creek actually called the White Earth, farther downstream.) Observe Lewis's
conviction that it must lead beyond 49° and provide access to the
Saskatchewan River and its rich trade.

Page 98
appears in great quantities along the banks of this river, which are in many places so
thickly covered with it that they appear perfectly white. perhaps it has been from this
white appearance of it's banks that the river has derived it's name. this river is said
to be navigable nearly to it's source, which is at no great distance from the
Saskashawan, and I think from it's size the direction wich it seems to take, and the
latitude of it's mouth, that there is very good ground to believe that it extends as far
North as latitude 50° this stream passes through an open country generally.
Coal or carbonated wood pumice stone lava and other mineral apearances still
continue. the coal appears to be of better quality; I exposed a specimen of it to the
fire and found that it birnt tolerably well, it afforded but little flame or smoke, but
produced a hot and lasting fire. I asscended to the top of the cutt bluff this morning,
from whence I had a most delightfull view of the country, the whole of which except
the vally formed by the Missouri is void of timber or underbrush, exposing to the first
glance of the spectator immence herds of Buffaloe, Elk, deer, & Antelopes feeding in
one common and boundless pasture. we saw a number of bever feeding on the bark
of the trees alonge the verge of the river, several of which we shot, found them large
and fat. walking on shore this evening I met with a buffaloe calf which attatched itself
to me and continued to follow close at my heels untill I embarked and left it. it
appeared allarmed at my dog which was probably the cause of it's so readily
attatching itself to me. Capt Clark informed me that he saw a large drove of buffaloe
pursued by wolves today, that they at length caught a calf which was unable to keep
up with the herd. the cows only defend their young so long as they are able to keep
up with the herd, and seldom return any distance in surch of them.
THURSDAY APRIL 25TH 1805.
the water friezed on the oars this morning as the men rowed. about 10 oclock A.M.
the wind began to blow so violently that we were obliged to lye too. my dog had
been absent during the last night, and I was fearfull we had lost him altogether,
however, much to my satisfaction he joined us at 8 oclock this morning. Knowing
that the river was crooked, from the report of the hunters

Page 99
who were out yesterday, and beleiving that we were at no very great distance from
the Yellow stone River; I determined, in order as mush as possible to avoid
detention, to proceed by land with a few men to the entrance of that river and make
the necessary observations to determine its position; accordingly I set out at 11
OCk. on the Lard. side, accompanyed by four men. when we had proceeded about
four miles, I ascended the hills from whence I had a most pleasing view of the
country, particularly of the wide and fertile vallies formed by the missouri and the
yellowstone rivers, which occasionally unmasked by the wood on their borders
disclose their meanderings for many miles in their passage through these delightfull
tracts of country. I determined to encamp on the bank of the Yellow stone river
which made it's appearance about 2 miles South of me. the whol face of the country
was covered with herds of Buffaloe, Elk & Antelopes; deer are also abundant, but
keep themselves more concealed in the woodland. the buffaloe Elk and Antelope are
so gentle that we pass near them while feeding, without appearing to excite any
alarm among them; and when we attract their attention, they frequently approach us
more nearly to discover what we are, and in some instances pursue us a
considerable distance apparenly with that view. we encamped on the bank of the
yellow stone river, 2 miles South of it's confluence with the Missouri.
FRIDAY APRIL 26TH 1805.
This morning I dispatched Joseph Fields up the yellowstone river with orders to
examine it as far as he could conveniently and return the same evening; while I
proceeded down the river with one man in order to take a view of the confluence of
this great river with the Missouri, which we found to be two miles distant on a direct
line N.W. from our encampment. the bottom land on the lower side of the
yellowstone river near it's mouth, for about one mile in width appears to be subject
to inundation; while that on the opposite side of the Missouri and the point formed
by the junction of these rivers is of the common elivation, say from twelve to 18 feet
above the level of the water, and of course not liable to be overflown except in
extreem high water, which dose not appear to be very frequent. there is more timber
in the neighbourhood of the junction of these rivers, and on the Missouri as far below

Page 100

Page 101
as the White-earth river, than there is on any part of the Missouri above the entrance
of the Chyenne river to this place.
about 12 O[c]lock I heard the discharge of several guns at the junction of the rivers,
which announced to me the arrival of the pa[r]ty with Capt Clark; I afterwards learnt
that they had fired on some buffaloe which they met with at that place, and of which
they killed a cow and several Calves; the latter are now fine veal. after I had
completed my observations in the evening I walked down and joined the party at
their encampment on the point of land formed by the junction of the rivers; found
them all in good health, and much pleased at having arrived at this long wished for
spot, and in order to add in some measure to the general pleasure which seemed to
pervade our little community, we ordered a dram to be issued to each person; this
soon produced the fiddle, and they spent the evening with much hilarity, singing &
dancing, and seemed as perfectly to forget their past toils, as they appeared
regardless of those to come.
Capt Clark measured these rivers just above their confluence; found the bed of the
Missouri 520 yards wide, the water occupying 330. it's channel deep. the
yellowstone river including it's sandbar, 858 yds. of which, the water occupyed 297
yards; the depest part 12 feet; it was falling at this time & appeard to be nearly at it's
summer tide. the Indians inform that the yellowstone river is navigable for perogues
and canoes nearly to it's source in the Rocky Mountains, and that in it's course near
these mountains it passes within less than half a day's march of a navigable part of
the Missouri. it's extreem sources are adjacent to those of the Missouri, river platte,
and I think probably with some of the South branch of the Columbia river.8 the water
of this river is turbid, tho' dose not possess as much sediment as that of the
Missouri.
8 This information about the headwaters is, of course, erroneous. The first
known use of the names Rochejaune or Yellowstone was by James Mackay in
1795. In this same summer, 1805, the North West Company made its first
move to open the Far Western trade by sending François Antoine Larocque
overland to explore the Yellowstone. He left the Mandan villages in June,
traveling with a party of Crows, and reached the Yellowstone near the mouth
of the Big Horn. He then traveled slowly down the valley of the Yellowstone,
reaching the mouth, where Lewis and Clark now are, at the end of September.
It was a fruitless exploration but Larocque did establish (by reliable hearsay) a
fact which Clark missed now and on his descent in 1806, the existence of the
falls of the Yellowstone.

From the Yellowstone to the Musselshell
[Lewis] SUNDAY APRIL 28TH 1805.
Set out this morning at an early hour; the wind was favourable and we employed our
sails to advantage. Capt Clark walked on shore this morning, and I proceeded with
the party. we saw great quantities of game today; consisting of the common and
mule deer, Elk, Buffaloe, and Antelopes; also four brown bear, one of which was
fired on and wounded by one of the party but we did not get it; the beaver have cut
great quantities of timber; saw a tree nearly 3 feet in diameter that had been felled
by them.
MONDAY APRIL 29TH 1805.
I walked on shore with one man. about 8. A.M. we fell in with two brown or yellow
bear;1 both of which we wounded; one of them made his escape, the other after my
firing on him pursued me seventy or eighty yards, but fortunately had been so badly
wounded that he was unable to pursue me so closely as to prevent my charging my
gun; we again repeated our fir and killed him. it was a male not fully grown, we
estimated his weight at 300 lbs. not having the means of ascertaining it precisely.
The legs of this
1 A grizzly, the first one. Lewis presently loses his easy superiority, the result
of the ease with which this one was killed. His erroneous statement that the
grizzly's testicles are provided separate individual scrota, which he later
repeats, is inexplicable. Though far from being the first description of a grizzly
as some texts have said, this is the first detailed one. Henry Kelsey, in 1691,
was probably the first white man to see a grizzly.

Page 103
bear are somewhat longer than those of the black, as are it's tallons and tusks
incomparably larger and longer. the testicles, which in the black bear are placed
pretty well back between the thyes and contained in one pouch like those of the dog
and most quadrupeds, are in the yellow or brown bear placed much further foward,
and are suspended in separate pouches from two to four inches asunder; it's colour
is yellowish brown, the eyes small, black, and piercing; the front of the fore legs near
the feet is usually black; the fur is finer thicker and deeper than that of the black
bear. these are all the particulars in which this anamal appeared to me to differ from
the black bear; it is a much more furious and formidable anamal, and will frequently
pursue the hunter when wounded. it is asstonishing to see the wounds they will bear
before they can be put to death. the Indians may well fear this anamal equiped as
they generally are with their bows and arrows or indifferent fuzees, but in the hands
of skillfull riflemen they are by no means as formidable or dangerous as they have
been represented.
game is still very abundant we can scarcely cast our eyes in any direction without
percieving deer Elk Buffaloe or Antelopes. The quantity of wolves appear to increase
in the same proportion; they generally hunt in parties of six eight or ten; they kill a
great number of the Antelopes at this season; the Antelopes are yet meagre and the
females are big with young; the wolves take them most generally in attempting to
swim the river; in this manner my dog caught one drowned it and brought it on
shore; they are but clumsey swimers, tho' on land when in good order, they are
extreemly fleet and dureable. we have frequently seen the wolves in pursuit of the
Antelope in the plains; they appear to decoy a single one from a flock, and then
pursue it, alturnately relieving each other untill they take it. on joining Capt Clark he
informed me that he had seen a female and faun of the bighorned anamal; that they
ran for some distance with great aparent ease along the side of the river bluff where
it was almost perpendicular; two of the party fired on them while in motion without
effect. we took the flesh of the bear on board and proceeded. Capt. Clark walked on
shore this evening, killed a deer, and saw several of the bighorned anamals.2
2 The bighorn or Rocky Mountain sheep. Its meat was one of the great
delicacies of the West.

[Clark] MAY 2ND THURSDAY 1805
The wind blew verry hard all the last night, this morning about sunrise began to
Snow, (The Thermomtr. at 28. abov 0) and continued until about 10 oClock, at
which time it seased, the wind continued hard untill about 2 P.M. the Snow which fell
to day was about 1 In deep, a verry extraodernarey climate, to behold the trees
Green & flowers spred on the plain, & Snow an inch deep. we Set out about 3 oClock
and proceeded on about five 1/2 miles and encamped on the Std Side, the evening
verry cold, Ice freesing to the Ores. I shot a large beaver & Drewyer three in walking
on the bank, the flesh of those animals the party is fond of eating &c.
MAY 3RD FRIDAY 1805
we Set out reather later this morning than useal owing to weather being verry cold, a
frost last night and the Thermt. stood this morning at 26 above 0. which is 6 degrees
blow freesing. the ice that was on the Kettle left near the fire last night was 1/4 of an
inch thick. The snow is all or nearly all off the low bottoms, the Hills are entireley
covered; three of our party found in the back of a bottom 3 pieces of scarlet [cloth]
one brace3 in each, which had been left as a sacrifice near one of their swet houses,
on the L.S. we passed to day a curious collection of bushes tied up in the shape of
faccene about 10 feet diamuter, which must have been left also by the natives as an
offering to their medison which they [are] convinced protected or gave them relief
near the place, the wind continued to blow hard from the West, altho' not sufficently
so to detain us. Great numbers of Buffalow, Elk, Deer, antilope, beaver, Procupins, &
water fowls seen to day, such as, Geese, ducks of dift. kinds, & a fiew Swan.
MAY 4TH SATTURDAY 1805
The rudder Irons of our large Perogue broke off last night, the replaceing of which
detained us this morning untill 9 oClock at
3 A rough measurement of length, from fingertip to fingertip with the arms
stretched out.

Page 105
which time we set out The countrey on each side of the Missouri is a rich high and
butifull the bottoms are extencive with a great deal of timber on them all the fore
part of this day the wood land bordered the river on both Sides, in the after part of
butifull assending plain on the Std Side we encamped on the Std. Side a little above.
Saw great numbers of anamals of different kinds on the banks, we have one man
Sick. The river has been falling for several days passed; it now begins to rise a little,
the rate of rise & fall is from one to 3 inches in 24 hours
5TH OF MAY SUNDAY 1805
We set out verry early and had not proceeded far before the rudder Irons of one of
the Perogus broke which detained us a short time Capt Lewis walked on shore this
morning and killed a Deer, after brackfast I walked on shore Saw great numbers of
Buffalow & Elk Saw also a Den of young wolves, and a number of Grown Wolves in
every direction, The Countrey on both sides is as yesterday handsom & fertile. The
river rising & current Strong & in the evening we saw a Brown or Grisley beare on a
sand beech, I went out with one man Geo Drewyer & Killed the bear, which was
verry large and a turrible looking animal, which we found verry hard to kill we Shot
ten Balls into him before we killed him, & 5 of those Balls through his lights This
animal is the largest of the carnivorous kind I ever saw
[Lewis] SUNDAY MAY 5TH 1805
it was a most tremendious looking anamal, and extreemly hard to kill
notwithstanding he had five balls through his lungs and five others in various parts
he swam more than half the distance across the river to a sandbar, & it was at least
twenty minutes before he died; he did not attempt to attack, but fled and made the
most tremendous roaring from the moment he was shot. We had no means of
weighing this monster; Capt. Clark thought he would weigh 500 lbs. for my own part
I think the estimate too smally by 100 lbs. he measured 8. Feet 7 1/2 Inches from
the nose to the extremety of the hind feet, 5 F. 10 1/2 Ins. arround the breast

Page 106
1 F. 11. I. arround the middle of the arm, & 3.F. 11.I. arround the neck; his tallons
which were five in number on each foot were 4 3/8 Inches in length. he was in good
order, we therefore divided him among the party and made them boil the oil and put
it in a cask for future uce; the oil is as hard as hogs lard when cool, much more so
than that of the black bear. this bear differs from the common black bear in several
respects; it's tallons are much longer and more blont, it's tale shorter, it's hair which
is of a redish or bey brown, is longer thicker and finer than that of the black bear; his
liver lungs and heart are much larger even in proportion with his size; the heart
particularly was as large as that of a large Ox. his maw was also ten times the size of
black bear, and was filled with flesh and fish.
The party killed two Elk and a Buffaloe today, and my dog caught a goat, which he
overtook by superior fleetness, the goat it must be understood was with young and
extreemly poor.
MONDAY MAY 6TH 1805.
saw a brown [grizzly] bear swim the river above us, he disappeared before we can
get in reach of him; I find that the curiossity of our party is pretty well satisfyed with
rispect to this anamal, the formidable appearance of the male bear killed on the 5th
added to the difficulty with which they die when even shot through the vital parts,
has staggered the resolution [of] several of them, others however seem keen for
action with the bear; I expect these gentlemen will give us some amusement shotly
as they [the bears] soon begin now to coppolate. saw a great quantity of game of
every species common here. Capt Clark walked on shore and killed two Elk, they
were not in very good order, we therefore took a part of the meat only; it is now
only amusement for Capt. C. and myself to kill as much meat as the party can
consum.
WEDNESDAY MAY 8TH 1805.
we nooned it just above the entrance of a large river which disimbogues on the Lard.
[Starbd] side; I took the advantage of this leasure moment and examined the river
about 3 miles; I

Page 107
have no doubt but it is navigable for boats perogues and canoes, for the latter
probably a great distance. from the quantity of water furnished by this river it must
water a large extent of country; perhaps this river also might furnish a practicable
and advantageous communication with the Saskashiwan river; it is sufficiently large
to justify a belief that it might reach to that river if it's direction be such. the water of
this river possesses a peculiar whiteness, being about the colour of a cup of tea with
the admixture of a tablespoonfull of milk. from the colour of it's water we called it
Milk river. we think it possible that this may be the river called by the Minitares the
river which scoalds at all others4 Capt Clark who walked this morning on the Lard.
shore ascended a very high point opposite to the mouth of this river; he informed
me that he had a perfect view of this river and the country through which it passed
for a great distance probably 50 or 60 Miles, that the river from it's mouth bore N.W.
for 12 or 15 Miles when it forked, the one taking a direction nearly North, and the
other to the West of N. West.
Capt C. could not be certain but thought he saw the smoke and some Indian lodges
at a considrable distance up Milk river.
THURSDAY MAY 9TH 1805.
Capt C. killed 2 bucks and 2 buffaloe, I also killed one buffaloe which proved to be
the best meat, it was in tolerable order; we saved the best of the meat, and from the
cow I killed we saved the necessary materials for making what our wrighthand cook
Charbono calls the boudin (poudingue) blanc, and immediately set him about
preparing them for supper; this white pudding we all esteem one of the greatest
delacies of the forrest, it may not be amiss therefore to give it a place. About 6 feet
of the lower extremity of the large gut of the Buffaloe is the first mosel that the cook
makes love to, this he holds fast at one end with the right hand, while with the
forefinger and thumb of the left he gently compresses it, and discharges what he
says is not good to eat,
4 This identification of the stream here named Milk River as the one which the
Indians had called the River That Scolds All the Others was to be responsible
for considerable anxiety later on. One result which Lewis does not allude to
was to make the expedition believe it was nearer the Three Forks than in fact it
was.

Page 108
but of which in the s[e]quel we get a moderate portion; the mustle lying underneath
the shoulder blade next to the back, and fillets are next saught, these are needed up
very fine with a good portion of kidney suit; to this composition is then added a just
proportion of pepper and salt and a small quantity of flour; thus far advanced, our
skilfull opporater Co seizes his recepticle, which has never once touched the water,
for that would intirely distroy the regular order of the whole procedure; you will not
forget that the side you now see is that covered with a good coat of fat provided the
anamal be in good order; the operator sceizes the recepticle I say, and tying it fast
at one end turns it inward and begins now with repeated evolutions of the hand and
arm, and a brisk motion of the finger and thumb to put in what he says is bon pour
manger; thus by stuffing and compressing he soon distends the recepticle to the
utmost limmits of it's power of expansion, and in the course of it's longtudinal
progress it drives from the other end of the recepticle a much larger portion of the
[blank space in MS.] than was prevously discharged by the finger and thumb of the
left hand in a former part of the operation; thus when the sides of the recepticle are
skilfully exchanged the outer for the iner, and all is compleatly filled with something
good to eat, it is tyed at the other end, but not any cut off, for that would make the
pattern too scant; it is then baptised in the missouri with two dips and a flirt, and
bobbed into the kettle; from whence, after it be well boiled it is taken and fryed with
bears oil untill it becomes brown, when it is ready to esswage the pangs of a keen
appetite or such as travelers in the wilderness are seldom at a loss for.
TUESDAY MAY 14TH 1805.
one of the party wounded a brown [grizzly] bear very badly, but being alone did not
think proper to pursue him. In the evening the men in two of the rear canoes
discovered a large brown bear lying in the open grounds about 300 paces from the
river, and six of them went out to attack him, all good hunters; they took the
advantage of a small eminence which concealed them and got within 40 paces of him
unperceived, two of them reserved their fires as had been previously conscerted, the
four others

Page 109
fired nearly at the same time and put each his bullet through him, two of the balls
passed through the bulk of both lobes of his lungs, in an instant this monster ran at
them with open mouth, the two who had reserved their fir[e]s discharged their
pieces at him as he came towards them, boath of them struck him, one only slightly
and the other fortunately broke his shoulder, this however only retarded his motion
for a moment only, the men unable to reload their guns took to flight, the bear
pursued and had very nearly overtaken them before they reached the river; two of
the party betook themselves to a canoe and the others seperated an[d] concealed
themselves among the willows, reloaded their pieces, each discharged his piece at
him as they had an opportunity they struck him several times again but the guns
served only to direct the bear to them, in this manner he pursued two of them
seperately so close that they were obliged to throw aside their guns and pouches
and throw themselves into the river altho' the bank was nearly twenty feet
perpendicular; so enraged was this anamal that he plunged into the river only a few
feet behind the second man he had compelled [to] take refuge in the water, when
one of those who still remained on shore shot him through the head and finally killed
him; they then took him on shore and butch[er]ed him when they found eight balls
had passed through him in different directions; the bear being old the flesh was
indifferent, they therefore only took the skin and fleece, the latter made us several
gallons of oil.
It was after the sun had set before these men come up with us, where we had been
halted by an occurence, which I have now to recappitulate, and which altho' happily
passed without ruinous injury, I cannot recollect but with the utmost trepidation and
horror; this is the upseting and narrow escape of the white perogue. It happened
unfortunately for us this evening that Charbono was at the helm of this Perogue, in
stead of Drewyer, who had previously steered her; Charbono cannot swim and is
perhaps the most timid waterman in the world; perhaps it was equally unluckey that
Capt. C. and myself were both on shore at that moment, a circumstance which rarely
happened; and tho' we were on the shore opposite to the perogue, were too far
distant to be heard or to do more than remain spectators of her fate; in this perogue
were embarked, our papers, Instruments, books medicine, a great

Page 110
part of our merchandize and in short almost every article indispensibly necessary to
further the views, or insure the success of the enterpize in which we are now
launched to the distance of 2200 miles. surfice it so say, that the Perogue was under
sail when a sudon squawl of wind struck her obliquely, and turned her considerably,
the steersman allarmed, in stead of puting, her before the wind, lufted her up into it,
the wind was so violent that it drew the brace of the squarsail out of the hand of the
man who was attending it, and instantly upset the perogue and would have turned
her completely topsaturva, had it not have been from the resistance mad by the
oarning [awning] against the water. In this situation Capt. C. and myself both fired
our guns to attract the attention if possible of the crew and ordered the halyards to
be cut and the sail hawled in, but they did not hear us; such was their confusion and
consternation at this moment, that they suffered the perogue to lye on her side for
half a minute before they took the sail in. The perogue then wrighted but had filled
within an inch of the gunwals; Charbono still crying to his god for mercy, had not yet
recollected the rudder, nor could the repeated orders of the Bowsman, Cruzat, bring
him to his recollection untill he threatend to shoot him instantly if he did not take
hold of the rudder and do his duty. the waves by this time were runing very high, but
the fortitude resolution and good conduct of Cruzat saved her; he ordered 2 of the
men to throw out the water with some kettles that fortunately were convenient,
while himself and two others rowed her as[h]ore, where she arrived scarcely above
the water; we now took every article out of her and lay them to drane as well as we
could for the evening, baled out the canoe and secured her.
there were two other men beside Charbono on board who could not swim, and who
of course must also have perished had the perogue gone to the bottom. while the
perogue lay on her side, finding I could not be heard, I for a moment forgot my own
situation, and involluntarily droped my gun, threw aside my shot pouch and was in
the act of unbuttoning my coat, before I recollected the folly of the attempt I was
about to make; which was to throw myself into the river and indevour to swim to the
perogue; the perogue was three hundred yards distant the waves so high that a
perogue could scarcely live in any situation, the water excessively

Page 111
could, and the stream rappid; had I undertaken this project therefore, there was a
hundred to one but what I should have paid the forfit of my life for the madness of
my project, but this had the perogue been lost, I should have valued but little. After
having all matters arranged for the evening as well as the nature of the
circumstances would permit, we thought it a proper occasion to console ourselves
and cheer the sperits of our men and accordingly took a drink of grog and gave each
man a gill of sperits.
THURSDAY MAY 16TH
The morning was fair and the day proved favorable to our operations; by 4 oClock in
the evening our Instruments, Medicine, merchandize provision &c, were perfectly
dryed, repacked and put on board the perogue. the loss we sustained was not so
great as we had at first apprehended; our medicine sustained the greatest injury,
several articles of which were intirely spoiled, and many others considerably injured,
the ballance of our losses consisted of some gardin seeds, a small quantity of
gunpowder, and a few culinary articles which fell overboard and sunk. the Indian
woman to whom I ascribe equal fortitude and resolution, with any person onboard at
the time of the accedent, caught and preserved most of the light articles which were
washed overboard.
in the early part of the day two of our men fired on a panther, a little below our
encampment, and wounded it; they informed us that it was very large, had just killed
a deer partly devoured it, and in the act of concealing the ballance as they
discovered him. this morning a white bear toar Labuiche's coat which he had left in
the plains.
FRIDAY MAY 17TH
we employed the toe line the greater part of the day; the banks were firm and shore
boald which favoured the uce of the cord. I find this method of asscending the river,
when the shore is such as will permit it, the safest and most expeditious mode of
traveling, except with sails in a steady and favourable breze. the great number of
large beds of streams perfectly dry which we daily pass indicate a country but badly
watered, which I fear is the case

Page 112
with the country through which we have been passing for the last fifteen or twenty
days. Capt. Clark walked on shore this evening and killed an Elk; buffaloe are not so
abundant as they were some days past. the party with me killed a female brown
bear, she was but meagre, and appeared to have suckled young very recently. Capt.
Clark narrowly escaped being bitten by a rattlesnake in the course of his walk, the
party killed one this evening at our encampment, which he informed me was similar
to that he had seen; this snake is smaller than those common to the middle Atlantic
States, being about 2 feet 6 inches long; it is of a yellowish brown colour on the back
and sides, variagated with one row of oval spots of a dark brown colour lying
transversely over the back from the neck to the tail, and two other rows of small
circular spots of the same colour which garnis the sides along the edge of the scuta.
it's bely contains 176 [s]cuta on the belly and 17 on the tale. Capt Clark saw an
Indian fortifyed camp this evening, which appeared to have been recently occupyed,
from which we concluded it was probable that it had been formed by a war party of
the Menetares who left their vilage in March last with a view to attack the blackfoot
Indians in consequence of their having killed some of their principal warriors the
previous autumn. we were roused late at night by the Sergt. of the guard, and
warned of the danger we were in from a large tree that had taken fire and which
leant immediately over our lodge. we had the loge removed, and a few minutes after
a large proportion of the top of the tree fell on the place the lodge had stood; had we
been a few minutes later we should have been crushed to attoms. the wind blew so
hard, that notwithstanding the lodge was fifty paces distant from the fire it sustained
considerable injury from the burning coals which were thrown on it; the party were
much harrassed also by this fire which communicated to a collection of fallen timber,
and could not be extinguished.
[Clark] MAY 19TH SUNDAY 1805
a verry cold night, the murckery stood at 38 at 8 oClock this morning, a heavy dew
which is the 2d I have seen this spring. The fog (which was the first) was so thick
this morning that we could not Set out untill the Sun was about 2 hours up, at which
time a small breeze sprung up from the E which cleared off the

Page 113
fog & we proceeded on by means of the Cord The hills are high & rugged the
countrey as yesterday. I walked on Shore with two men we killed a white or grey
bear; not withstanding that it was Shot through the heart it ran at it's usial pace near
a quarter of a mile before it fell. Capt Lewis's dog was badly bitten by a wounded
beaver and was near bleading to death, after killing the Bear I continued my walk
alone, & killed 3 Deer & a Beaver finding that the Perogues were below I assended
the highest hill I could see, from the top of which I saw the mouth of M. Shell R &
the meanderings of the Missouri for a long distance. I also saw a high mountain in a
westerley direction, bearing S.SW. about 40 or 50 miles distant, in the evening the
river was verry crooked and much more rapid & containing more sawyers than any
which we have passed above the River Platte Capt Lewis walked on Shore this after
noon & killed an Elk, Buck & a Beaver, I kiled three Deer at dinner, the hunters killed
three other Deer to day several beaver also killed. We camped on the Stard Side in a
bottom of small cotton wood
[Lewis] MONDAY 20TH 1805.
The hunters returned this evening and informed us that the country continued much
the same in appearance as that we saw where we were or broken, and that about
five miles ab[ov]e the mouth of shell river a handsome river of about fifty yards in
width discharged itself into the shell river on the Stard. or upper side; this stream we
called Sâh-câ-ger we-âh or bird woman's River, after our interpreter the Snake
woman.

a fine morning wind from the N E. river falling a little we set out at 7 oClock and
proceeded on verry well as usial by the assistance of the cord passed some verry
swift water, river narrow and crooked, at 11 oClock arrived at the mouth of Shell
river on the Lard Side and formed a camp for the present, haveing passed a large
creek about 4 miles below on the Ld Side which we call Blowing fly Creek from the
emence quantities of those insects which geather on our meat in such numbers that
we are oblige to brush them off what we eate. Muscle Shell River falls in on Lard

MAY 22ND WEDNESDAY 1805
The wind continued to blow so violently hard we did not think it prudent to set out
untill it luled a little, about 10 oClock we set out the morning cold, Capt Lewis walked
out before dinner & killed a Deer, I walked out after dinner and assended a but[te] a
few miles [off] to view the countrey, which I found roleing & of a verry rich stickey
soil producing but little vegetation of any kind except the prickley pear, but little
grass & that verry low. a great deal of scattering Pine on the Lard Side & Some few

MAY 25TH SATTURDAY 1805
I walked on shore and killed a female Ibi or big horn animal in my absence Drewyer
& Bratten killed two others, this animal is a species peculiar to this upper part of the
Missouri, the head and horns of the male which Drewyer killed to day weighed 27
lbs. it was somewhat larger than the mail of the Common Deer; the body reather
thicker deeper and not so long in proportion to it's hight as the common Deer; the
head and horns of the male are remarkably large compared with the other parts of
the animal; the whole form is much more delicate than that of the common goat, and
there is a greater disparity in the size of the

Page 116
mail and female than between those of either the deer or goat. the bone above the
Eye is remarkably prominant; the head nostrils and division of the upper lip are
precisely in form like the sheep. their legs resemble the sheep more than any other
animal with which I am acquainted tho' they are more delicately formed, like the
sheep they stand foward in the knee and the lower joint of the fore leg is smallest
where it joins the knee, the hoof is black and large in perpotion, is divided, very open
and roundly pointed at the toe; like the sheep; is much hollowed and Sharp on the
under edge like the Scotch goat, has two small Hoofs behind each foot below the
ankle as the goat Sheep and Deer have. the belley, iner side of the legs, and the
extremity of the rump and buttock's for about two inches 1\2 around the but of the
tail, are white, as is also the tail except just at its extremity on the upper side which
is of a dark brown.
the tail is about 3 inches in length covered with short hair, or at least not longer than
that of the body; the outer part of the animal are of a duskey brown or reather a lead
coloured light brown; the animal is now Sheding its winter coat which is thick not
quite as long as that of the Deer and appears to be inter mixt with a considerable
quantity of fine fur which lies next to the Skin and concealed by the coarcer hair; the
shape of the hair itself is cylindric as that of the Antilope is, but is smaller, shorter
and not compressed or flattened as that of the deers winter coat is. I believe this
animal only sheds it's hair once a year. it has Eight fore teeth in the under jaw and
no canine teeth. The Horns are large at their base, and occupy the crown of the head
almost entirely, they are compressed, bent backwards and lunated; the surface
swelling into wavey rings which incircleing the horn continue to succeed each other
from the base to the extremity and becomeing less elivated and more distant as they
receed from the head. The horn for about two thirds of its length is filled with a porus
bone which is united with the frontal bone the horns of the female are small, but are
also compressed and bent backwards and incircled with a succession of wavy rings.
the horn is of a light brown colour; when Dressed it is almost white extreamly
transparent and very elastic. this horn is used by the natives in constructing their
bows; I have no doubt of it's elegance and usefullness in hair combs, and might
probably answer as maney

Page 117
valuable purpoces to civilized man, as it does to the native indians, who form their
water cups, spoons and platters of it. the females have already brought forth their
young, indeed from the size of the young, I suppose that they produce them early in
March. they have from one to two at a birth. they feed on grass, but principally on
the arramatic herbs which grow on the clifts and inaxcessable hights which they
frequent most commonly, and the places they generally collect to lodge is the
cranies or cevices of the rocks in the face of inaccessable precepices, where the wolf
nor Bear can reach them, and where indeed man himself would in maney instances
find a similar deficiency; yet those animals bound from rock to rock and stand
apparently in the most careless manner on the Side of precipices of maney hundred
feet. they are very shy and quick of both sent and sight.1
In my walk of this day I saw mountts on either side of the river at no great distance,
those mountains appeared to be detached, and not ranges as laid down by the
Minetarrees, I also think I saw a range of high Mounts. at a great distance to the S S
W. but am not certain as the horozon was not clear enough to view it with certainty.
The appearence of salts, and bitumun still continue. we saw a polecat to day being
the first which we have seen for some time past. The Air of this quarter is pure and
helthy. the water of the Missouri will tasted not quite so muddy as it is below, not
withstanding the last rains has raised the river a little it is less muddy than it was
before the rain.
[Lewis] SUNDAY MAY 26TH 1805.
proceeded principally by the toe line, using the oars mearly to pass the river in order
to take advantage of the shores. scarcely any bottoms to the river; the hills high and
juting in on both sides, to the river in many places. the stone tumbleing from these
clifts and brought down by the rivulets became more troublesome today. Capt. Clark
walked on shore this morning and ascended to the summit of the river hills he
informed me on his return that he had seen mountains on both sides of the river
runing nearly parrallel with it and at no great distance; also an irregular range of
mountains on lard. about 50 Mls. distant; the extremities of which boar

Page 118
W. and N.W. from his station. he also saw in the course of his walk, some Elk
several herds of the Big horn, and the large hare; the latter is common to every part
of this open country. scarcely any timber to be seen except the few scattering pine
and spruce which crown the high hills, or in some instances grow along their sides.
In the after part of the day I also walked out and ascended the river hills which I
found sufficiently fortiegueing. on arriving to the summit [of] one of the highest
points in the neighbourhood I thought myself well repaid for my labour; as from this
point I beheld the Rocky Mountains for the first time, I could only discover a few of
the most elivated points above the horizon, the most remarkable of which by my
pocket compass I found bore N. 65° W. being a little to the N. of the N.W. extremity
of the range of broken mountains seen this morning by Capt. C. these points of the
Rocky Mountains were covered with snow and the sun shone on it in such manner as
to give me the most plain and satisfactory view.2 while I viewed these mountains I
felt a secret pleasure in finding myself so near the head of the heretofore conceived
boundless Missouri; but when I reflected on the difficulties which this snowey barrier
would most probably throw in my way to the Pacific, and the sufferings and
hardships of myself and party in thim, it in some measure counterballanced the joy I
had felt in the first moments in which I gazed on them; but as I have always held it a
crime to anticipate evils I will believe it a good comfortable road untill I am compelled
to believe differently.
late this evening we passed a very bad rappid which reached quite across the river;
the party had considerable difficulty in ascending it altho' they doubled their crews
and used both the rope and the pole. while they were passing this rappid a female
Elk and it's fawn swam down through the waves which ran very high, hence the
name of Elk rappids which they instantly gave this place, these are the most
considerable rappids which we have yet seen on the missouri and in short the only
place where there has appeared to be a suddon decent. This is truly a desert barren
country and I feel myself still more convinced of it's being

called the Little Rocky Mountains of northern Montana for a chain of the main
range.

a continuation of the black hills. we have continued every day to pass more or less
old stick lodges of the Indians in the timbered points, there are two even in this little
bottom where we lye.
[Clark] MAY 28TH TUESDAY 1805
a cloudy morning some fiew drops of rain and verry smokey The shoaley places are
verry numerous and some bad to get around we have to make use of the cord &
Poles, and our tow ropes are all except one of Elkskin, & stretch and sometimes
brake which indanger the Perogues or canoe, as it imedeately turns and if any rock
should chance to be below, the rapidity of the current would turn her over [if] she
should chance to strike the rock, we observe great caution at those places.
I saw great numbers of the Big horned animals, one of which I killed their fauns are
nearly half grown. one of the Party saw a verry large bear, picked up on the shore a
pole which had been made use of by the nativs for lodge poles, & haul'd by dogs it is
new and is a certain sign of the Indians being on the river above a foot ball and
several other articles are also found to substantiate this oppinion. at 1 oClock we had
a few drops of rain and some thunder whic is the first thunder we have had since we
set out from Fort Mandan,
[Lewis] WEDNESDAY MAY 29TH 1805
Last night we were all allarmed by a large buffaloe Bull, which swam over from the
opposite shore and coming along side of the white perogue, climbed over it to land,
he then allarmed ran up the bank in full speed directly towards the fires, and was
within 18 inches of the heads of some of the men who lay sleeping before the
centinel could allarm him or make him change his course, still more alarmed, he now
took his direction immediately towards our lodge, passing between 4 fires and within
a few inches of the heads of one range of the men as they yet lay sleeping, when he
came near the tent, my dog saved us by causing him to change his course a second
time, which he did by turning a little to the right, and was quickly out of sight,
leaving us by this time all in an uproar with our guns in o[u]r hands, en-

Page 120
quiring of each other the ca[u]se of the alarm, which after a few moments was
explained by the centinel: we were happy to find no one hirt. The next morning we
found that the buffaloe in passing the perogue had trodden on a rifle, which belonged
to Capt. Clark's black man, who had negligently left her in the perogue, the rifle was
much bent, he had also broken the spindle; pivit, and shattered the stock of one of
the blunderbushes on board, with this damage I felt well content, happey indeed,
that we had sustaned no further injury, it appears that the white perogue, which
contains our most valuable stores is attended by some evil gennii.
This morning we set out at an early hour and proceded as usual by the Chord. at the
distance of 2 1\2 Miles passed a handsome river which discharged itself on the Lard.
side, I walked on shore and acended this river about a mile and a half in order to
examine it. the water of this River is clearer much than any we have met with great
abundance of the Argalia or Bighorned animals in the high country through which this
river passes. Cap. C. who assended this R. much higher than I did has thought
proper to call it Judieths River.3 on the Missouri just above the entrance of the Judith
River I counted the remains of the fires of 126 Indian lodges which appeared to be of
very recent date perhaps 12 or 15 days. Capt. Clark also saw a large encamp[m]ent
just above the entrance of this river on the Stard. side of reather older date,
probably they were the same Indians. The Indian woman with us ex[a]mined the
mockersons which we found at these encampments and informed us that they were
not of her nation the Snake Indians, but she beleived they were some of the Indians
who inhabit the country on this side of [the] Rocky Mountains and North of the
Missoury and I think it most probable that they were the Minetaries of Fort de
Prarie.4
Today we passed on the Stard. side the remains of a vast many mangled carcases of
Buffalow which had been driven over a precipice of 120 feet by the Indians and
perished; the water appeared to have washed away a part of this immence pile of
slaughter and still their remained the fragments of at least a hundred carcases they
created a most horrid stench. in this manner the Indians of the Missouri distroy vast
herds of buffaloe at a stroke; for this pur3 For Julia (Judy) Hancock of Virginia, whom Clark later married.

pose one of the most active and fleet young men is scelected and disguised in a robe
of buffaloe skin, having also the skin of the buffaloe's head with the years and horns
fastened on his head in form of a cap, thus caparisoned he places himself at a
convenient distance between a herd of buffaloe and a precipice proper for the
purpose, which happens in many places on this river for miles together; the other
indians now surround the herd on the back and flanks and at a signal agreed on all
shew themselves at the same time moving forward towards the buffaloe; the
disguised indian or decoy has taken care to place himself sufficiently nigh the
buffaloe to be noticed by them when they take to flight and runing before them they
follow him in full speede to the precipice, the cattle behind driving those in front over
and seeing them go do not look or hesitate about following untill the whole are
precipitated down the precepice forming one common mass of dead an[d] mangled
carcases: the decoy in the mean time has taken care to secure himself in some
cranney or crivice of the clift which he had previously prepared for that purpose. the
part of the decoy I am informed is extreamly dangerous, if they are not very fleet
runers the buffaloe tread them under foot and crush them to death, and sometimes
drive them over the precipice also, where they perish in common with the buffaloe.
we saw a great many wolves in the neighbourhood of these mangled carcases they
were fat and extreemly gentle, Capt. C. who was on shore killed one of them with his
espontoon.5 soon after we landed it began to blow & rain, and as there was no
appearance of even wood enough to make our fires for some distance above we
determined to remain here untill the next morning, and accordingly fixed our camp
and gave each man a small dram. notwithstanding the allowance of sperits we issued
did not exceed 1\2 [jill] pr. man several of them were considerably effected by it;
such is the effects of abstaining for some time from the uce of sperituous liquors;
they were all very merry.

The rain commenced yesterday evining, and continued moderately through the
course of the night, more rain has now

Page 122
fallin than we have experienced since the 15th of September last, the rain continued
this morning, and the wind too high for us to proceed, untill about 11 oClock at
which time we set out, and proceeded on with great labour, we were obliged to
make use of the Tow rope & the banks were so muddey & slipery that the men could
scercely walk not with standing we proceeded on as well as we could wind hard from
the NW. in attempting to assend a rapid our toe cord broke & we turned without
injurey. those rapids or shoaley points are noumerous and dificuelt, one being at the
mouth of every drean Some little rain at times all day one man assended the high
countrey and it was raining & snowing on those hills, the day has proved to be raw
and cold.
We discover in several places old encampments of large bands of Indians, a fiew
weeks past and appear to be makeing up the river. Those Indians we believe to be
the Blackfoot Inds. or Menitares who inhabit the heads of the Saskashowin & north
of this place. and trade a little in the Fort de Prarie establishments.
[Lewis] FRIDAY MAY 31ST 1805.
This morning we proceeded at an early hour with the two perogues leaving the
canoes and crews to bring on the meat of the two buffaloe that were killed last
evening and which had not been brought in as it was late and a little off the river.
soon after we got under way it began to rain and continued untill meridian when it
ceased but still remained cloudy through the ballance of the day. The obstructions of
rocky points and riffles still continue as yesterday; at those places the men are
compelled to be in the water even to their armpits, and the water is yet very could,
and so frequent are those point that they are one fourth of their time in the water,
added to this the banks and bluffs along which they are obliged to pass are so
slippery and the mud so tenacious that they are unable to wear their mockersons,
and in that situation draging the heavy burthen of a canoe and walking acasionally
for several hundred yards over the sharp fragments of rocks which tumble from the
clifts and garnish the borders of the river; in short their labour is incredibly painfull
and great, yet those faithfull fellows bear it without a murmur. The toe rope of the
white perogue, the only

Page 123
one indeed of hemp, and that on which we most depended, gave way today at a bad
point, the perogue swung and but slightly touched a rock; yet was very near
overseting; I fear her evil gennii will play so many pranks with her that she will go to
the bottomm some of those days.
The hills and river Clifts which we passed today exhibit a most romantic appearance.
The bluffs of the river rise to the hight of from 2 to 300 feet and in most places
nearly perpendicular; they are formed of remarkable white sandstone which is
sufficiently soft to give way readily to the impression of water; two or thre thin
horizontal stratas of white freestone, on which the rains or water make no
impression, lie imbeded in these clifts of soft stone near the upper part of them; the
earth on the top of these Clifts is a dark rich loam, which forming a graduly
ascending plain extends back from 1/2 a mile to a mile where the hills commence
and rise abruptly to a hight of about 300 feet more. The water in the course of time
in decending from those hills and plains on either side of the river has trickled down
the soft sand clifts and woarn it into a thousand grotesque figures, which with the
help of a little immagination and an oblique view, at a distance are made to represent
eligant ranges of lofty freestone buildings, having their parapets well stocked with
statuary; collumns of various sculpture both grooved and plain, are also seen
supporting long galleries in front of those buildings; in other places on a much nearer
approach and with the help of less immagination we see the remains or ruins of
eligant buildings; some collumns standing and almost entire with their pedestals and
capitals; others retaining their pedestals but deprived by time or accident of their
capitals, some lying prostrate an broken othe[r]s in the form of vast pyramids of
connic structure bearing a serees of other pyramids on their tops becoming less as
they ascend and finally terminating in a sharp point. nitches and alcoves of various
forms and sizes are seen at different hights as we pass. the thin stratas of hard
freestone intermixed with the soft sandstone seems to have aided the water in
forming this curious scenery. As we passed on it seemed as if those seens of
visionary inchantment would never have and [an] end; for here it is too that nature
presents to the view of the traveler vast ranges of walls of tolerable workmanship, so
perfect indeed are those walls that I should have thought that nature had attempted
here to rival the

Page 124
human art of masonry had I not recollected that she had first began her work. These
walls rise to the hight in many places of 100 feet, are perpendicular, with two regular
faces and are from one to 12 feet thick, each wall retains the same thickness at top
which it possesses at bottom.
SUNDAY JUNE 2ND 1805.
The wind blew violently last night and was attended by a slight shower of rain; the
morning was fair and we set out at an early hour. imployed the chord as usual the
greater part of the day. the courant was strong tho' regular, and the banks afforded
us good toeing. the wind was hard and against us yet we proceeded with infinitely
more ease than the two precedeing days. The river bluffs still continue to get lower
and the plains leveler and more extensive; the timber on the river increases in
quantity. Game becomeing more abundant this morning and I thought it best now to
loose no time or suffer an opportunity to escape in providing the necessary quantity
of Elk's skins to cover my leather boat which I now expect I shall be obliged to use
shortly.6 Accordingly I walked on shore most of the day with some of the hunters for
that purpose and Killed 6 Elk 2 buffale 2 Mule deer and a bear, these anamals were
all in good order we therefore took as much of the meat as our canoes and perogues
could conveniently carry. the bear was very near catching Drewyer; it also pursued
Charbono who fired his gun in the air as he ran but fortunately eluded the vigilence
of the bear by secreting himself very securely in the bushes untill Drewyer finally
killed it by a shot in the head; the [only] shot indeed that will conquer the farocity of
those tremendious anamals. we came too on the Lard. side in a handsome bottom of
small cottonwood timber opposite to the entrance of a very considerable river; but it
being too late to ex[a]mine these rivers minutely to night we determined to remain
here untill the morning, and as the evening was favourable to make some
observations.7
6 The expedition was carrying an invention of Lewis's, a collapsible iron
framework for a boat, which he expected to cover with hides and use when the
perogues became impracticable.
7 This is the stream which the Minnetarees had called the River That Scolds All
the Others and which Lewis and Clark supposed they had passed on May 8.
Observe, in the next entry, how it at once creates a crucial problem.

Page 125
MONDAY JUNE 3RD 1805.
This morning early we passed over and formed a camp on the point formed by the
junction of the two large rivers. here in the course of the day I continued my
observations. An interesting question was now to be determined; which of these
rivers was the Missouri, or that river which the Minnetares call Amahte Arzzha or
Missouri, and which they had discribed to us as approaching very near to the
Columbia river. to mistake the stream at this period of the season, two months of
the traveling season having now elapsed, and to ascend such stream to the rocky
Mountain or perhaps much further before we could inform ourselves whether it did
approach the Columbia or not, and then be obliged to return and take the other
stream would not only loose us the whole of this season but would probably so
dishearten the party that it might defeat the expedition altogether. convinced we
were that the utmost circumspection and caution was necessary in deciding on the
stream to be taken. to this end an investigation of both streams was the first thing to
be done; to learn their widths, debths, comparative rappidity of their courants and
thence the comparitive bodies of water furnished by each; accordingly we dispatched
two light canoes with three men in each up those streams; we also sent out several
small parties by land with instructions to penetrate the country as far as they
conveniently can permitting themselves time to return this evening and indeavour if
possible to discover the distant bearing of those rivers by ascending the rising
grounds.
between the time of my A. M. and meridian [observations] Capt. C. & myself stroled
out to the top of the hights in the fork of these rivers from whence we had an
extensive and most inchanting view; the country in every derection around us was
one vast plain in which innumerable herds of Buffalow were seen attended by their
shepperds the wolves; the solatary antelope which now had their young were
distributed over it's face; some herds of Elk were also seen; the verdure perfectly
cloathed the ground, the weather was pleasant and fair; to the South we saw a
range of lofty mountains which we supposed to be a continuation of the S.
Mountains, stretching themselves from S. E. to N. W. terminating abbrubtly about S.
West from us;8 these were partially covered
8 Probably the Highwood Mountains, near Great Falls, Montana.

Page 126
with snow; behind these Mountains and at a great distance, a second and more lofty
range of mountains appeared to strech across the country in the same direction with
the others, reaching from West, to the N of N. W.,9 where their snowey tops lost
themselves beneath the horizon. this last range was perfectly covered with snow.
the direction of the rivers could be seen but little way, soon loosing the break of their
channels, to our view, in the common plain. on our return to camp we boar a little to
the left and discovered a handsome little river falling into the N. fork on Lard. side
about 1 1/2 Mls. above our camp. this little river has as much timber in it's bottoms
as either of the larger streams.
we took the width of the two rivers, found the left hand or S. fork 372 yards and the
N. fork 200. The no[r]th fork is deeper than the other but it's courant not so swift;
it's waters run in the same boiling and roling manner which has uniformly
characterized the Missouri throughout it's whole course so far; it's waters are of a
whitish brown colour very thick and terbid, also characteristic of the Missouri; while
the South fork is perfectly transparent runds very rappid but with a smoth unriffled
surface it's bottom composed of round and flat smooth stones like most rivers
issuing from a mountainous country. the bed of the N. fork composed of some
gravel but principally mud; in short the air & character of this river is so precisely
that of the missouri below that the party with very few exceptions have already
pronounced the N. fork to be the Missouri; myself and Capt. C. not quite so
precipitate have not yet decided but if we were to give our opinions I believe we
should be in the minority, certain it is that the North fork gives the colouring matter
and character which is retained from hence to the gulph of Mexico. I am confident
that this river rises in and passes a great distance through an open plain country I
expect that it has some of it's sou[r]ces on the Eastern side of the rocky mountain
South of the Saskashawan, but that it does not penetrate the first range of these
Mountains. and that much the greater part of it's sources are in a northwardly
direction towards the lower and middle parts of the Saskashawan in the open plains.
convinced I am that if it penetrated the Rocky Mountains to any great distance it's
waters would be clearer unless it should run an immence distance indeed after
leaving those mountains through these level
9 Perhaps the Big Belt Mountains.

Page 127
plains in order to acquire it's turbid hue. what astonishes us a little is that the Indians
who appeared to be so well acquainted with the geography of this country should not
have mentioned this river on wright hand if it be not the Missouri; the river that
scolds at all others, as they call it if there is in reallity such an one, ought agreeably
to their account, to have fallen in a considerable distance below, and on the other
hand if this right hand or N. fork be the Missouri I am equally astonished at their not
mentioning the S. fork which they must have passed in order to get to those large
falls which they mention on the Missouri. thus have our cogitating faculties been
busily employed all day.
Those who have remained at camp today have been busily engaged in dressing skins
for cloathing, notwithstanding that many of them have their feet so mangled and
bruised with the stones and rough ground over which they passed barefoot, that
they can scarcely walk or stand; at least it is with great pain they do either. for some
days past they were unable to wear their mocker-sons; they have fallen off
considerably, but nothwithstanding the difficulties past, or those which seem now to
menace us, they still remain perfectly cheerful. In the evening the parties whom we
had sent out returned agreeably to instructions. The parties who had been sent up
the rivers in canoes informed that they ascended some distance and had then left
their canoes and walked up the rivers a considerable distance further barely leaving
themselves time to return; the North fork was not so rappid as the other and
afforded the easiest navigation of course; six (7) feet appeared to be the shallowest
water of the S. Branch and 5 feet that of the N. Their accounts were by no means
satisfactory nor did the information we acquired bring us nigher to the decision of
our question or determine us which stream to take.
Capt. C. and myself concluded to set out early the next morning with a small party
each, and ascend these rivers untill we could perfectly satisfy ourselves of the one,
which it would be most expedient for us to take on our main journey to the Pacific.
accordingly it was agreed that I should ascend the right hand fork and he the left. I
gave orders to Serj. Pryor Drewyer, Shields, Windsor, Cruzatte and La Page to hold
themselves in readiness to accompany me in the morning. Capt. Clark also selected
Reubin & Joseph Fields, Sergt. Gass, Shannon and his black man York, to accom-

Page 128
pany him. we agreed to go up those rivers one day and a halfs march or further if it
should appear necessary to satisfy us more fully of the point in question. I take my
Octant with me also, this I confide [to] La Page.
In accordance with this decision they set off the next day, Lewis to travel up the
northern fork and Clark up the southern fork till they can be sure. Clark is sure on
June 5, being convinced that the south fork leads to the Mountains.
[Clark] JUNE 5TH WEDNESDAY 1805
Some little rain & snow last night the mountains to our S E. covered with snow this
morning air verry cold & raining a little, we saw 8 buffalow opposit, the made 2
attempts to cross, the water being so swift they could not, about the time we were
setting out three white bear approached our camp we killed the three & eate part of
one & set out & proceeded on N. 20° W 11 miles struck the river at maney places in
this distance to a ridge on the N. Side from the top of which I could plainly see a
mountain to the South & W covered with Snow at a long distance, The mountains
opposit to us to the S.E. is also covered with snow this morning. a high ridge from
those mountains approached the river on the S E side forming some clifts of hard
dark Stone. From the ridge at which place I struck the river last, I could discover
that the river run west of south a long distance, and has a strong rapid current, as
this river continued its width debth & rapidity and the course west of south, going up
further would be useless, I deturmined to return, marked my name in a tree N. side
near the ridge where the little river brakes thro'
Lewis has to travel farther before coming to a conclusion.
[Lewis] THURSDAY JUNE 6TH 1805.
I now became well convinced that this branch of the Missouri

Page 129
had it's direction too much to the North for our rout to the Pacific, and therefore
determined to return the next day after taking an observation of the °'s Meridian
Altitude in order to fix the latitude of the place.10 The forepart of the last evening
was fair but in the latter part of the night clouded up and contnued so with short
intervals of sunshine untill a little before noon when the whole horizon was overcast,
and I of course disappointed in making the observation which I much wished. I had
sent Sergt. Pryor and Windsor early this morning with orders to procede up the river
to some commanding eminence and take it's bearing as far as possible. in the mean
time the four others and myself were busily engaged in making two rafts on which
we purposed descending the river; we had just completed this work when Sergt.
Pryor and Windsor returned, it being about noon; they reported that they had
proceded from hence S 70. W 6 M. to the summit of a commanding eminence from
whence the river on their left was about 2 1\2 miles distant; that a point of it's Lard.
Bluff, which was visible boar S 80. W. distant about 15 Ms.; that the river on their
left bent gradually arround to this point, and from thence seemed to run
Northwardly. we now took dinner and embarcked with our plunder and five Elk's
skins on the rafts but were soon convinced that this mode of navigation was
hazerdous particularly with those rafts they being too small and slender. we wet a
part of our baggage and were near loosing one of our guns; I therefore determined
to abandon the rafts and return as we had come, by land. I regretted much being
obliged to leave my Elk's skins, which I wanted to assist in forming my leather boat;
those we had prepared at Fort Mandan being injured in such manner that they would
not answer.
FRIDAY JUNE 7TH 1805.
It continued to rain almost without intermission last night and as I expected we had
a most disagreable and wrestless night. Our camp possessing no allurements, we
left our watery beads at an early hour and continued our rout down the river. it still
continues to rain the wind hard from N. E. and could. the grownd remarkably, slipry,
insomuch that we were unable to walk on the sides of the
10 This way would have taken him to Marias Pass.

Page 130
bluffs where we had passed as we ascended the river. notwithstanding the rain that
has now fallen the earth of these bluffs is not wet to a greater debth than 2 inches;
in it's present state it is precisely like walking over frozen growned which is thawed
to small debth and slips equally as bad. this clay not only appears to require more
water to saturate it as I before observed than any earth I ever observed but when
saturated it appears on the other hand to yeald it's moisture with equal difficulty.
In passing along the face of one of these bluffs today I sliped at a narrow pass of
about 30 yards in length and but for a quick and fortunate recovery by means of my
espontoon I should been precipitated into the river down a craggy pricipice of about
ninety feet. I had scarcely reached a place on which I could stand with tolerable
safety even with the assistance of my espoontoon before I heard a voice behind me
cry out god god Capt. what shall I do on turning about I found it was Windsor who
had sliped and fallen about the center of this narrow pass and was lying prostrate on
his belley, with his wright hand arm and leg over the precipice while he was holding
on with the left arm and foot as well as he could which appeared to be with much
difficulty. I discovered his danger and the trepidation which he was in gave me still
further concern for I expected every instant to see him loose his strength and slip
off; altho' much allarmed at his situation I disguised my feelings and spoke very
calmly to him and assured him that he was in no kind of danger, to take the knife out
of his belt behind him with his wright hand and dig a hole with it in the face of the
bank to receive his wright foot which he did and then raised himself to his knees; I
then directed him to take off his mockersons and to come forward on his hands and
knees holding the knife in one hand and the gun in the other this he happily effected
and escaped. those who were some little distance bhind returned by my orders and
waded the river at the foot of the bluff where the water was breast deep.
it was useless we knew to attempt the plains on this part of the river in consequence
of the numerous steep ravines which intersected and which were quite as bad as the
river bluffs. we therefore continued our rout down the river sometimes in the mud
and water of the bottom lands, at others in the river to our breasts and when the
water became so deep that we could not wade we cut foot-

Page 131
steps in the face of the steep bluffs with our knives and proceded. we continued our
disagreeable march th[r]ough the rain mud and water untill late in the evening
having traveled only about 18 Miles, and encamped in an old Indian stick lodge which
afforded us a dry and comfortable shelter. during the day we had killed six deer
some of them in very good order altho' none of them had yet entirely discarded their
winter coats. we had reserved and brought with us a good supply of the best peices;
we roasted and eat a hearty supper of our venison not having taisted a mosel before
during the day; I now laid myself down on some willow boughs to a comfortable
nights rest, and felt indeed as if I was fully repaid for the toil and pain of the day, so
much will a good shelter, a dry bed, and comfortable supper revive the sperits of the
waryed, wet and hungry traveler.

Chapter X
From Maria's River to the Great Falls of the Missouri
[Lewis] SATURDAY JUNE 8TH 1805.
The whole of my party to a man except myself were fully pe[r]suaided that this river
was the Missouri, but being fully of opinion that it was neither the main stream, nor
that which it would be advisable for us to take, I determined to give it a name and in
honour of Miss Maria Wd. [Wood] called it Maria's River. it is true that the hue of the
waters of this turbulent and troubled stream but illy comport with the pure celestial
virtues and amiable qualifications of that lovely fair one; but on the other hand it is a
noble river; one destined to become in my opinion an object of contention between
the two great powers of America and Great Britin with rispect to the adjustment of
the Northwestwardly boundary of the former; and that it will become one of the most
interesting branc[h]es of the Missouri in a commercial point of view, I have but little
doubt, as it abounds with anamals of the fur kind, and most probably furnishes a
safe and direct communication to that productive country of valuable furs exclusively
enjoyed at present by the subjects of his Britanic Majesty; in adition to which it
passes through a rich fertile and one of the most beatifully picteresque countries that
I ever beheld, through the wide expanse of which, innumerable herds of living
anamals are seen, it's borders garnished with one continued garden of roses, while
it's lofty and open forrests are the habitation of miriads of the feathered tribes who
salute the ear of the passing traveler with their wild and simple, yet s[w]eet and
cheerfull melody. I arrived at camp about 5 OClock in the evening much fatiegued,
where I found Capt. Clark and the ballance of the party

Page 133
waiting our return with some anxiety for our safety having been absent near two
days longer than we had engaged to return.
Capt Clark ploted the courses of the two rivers as far as we had ascended them. I
now began more than ever to suspect the varacity of Mr. Fidler1 or the correctness
of his instruments. for I see that Arrasmith in his late map of N. America has laid
down a remarkable mountain in the chain of the Rocky mountains called the tooth
nearly as far South as Latitude 45°, and this is said to be from the discoveries of Mr.
Fidler. we are now within a hundred miles of the Rocky Mountains, and I find from
my observation of the 3rd Inst that the latitude of this place is 47° 24' 12''.8. the
river must therefore turn much to the South between this and the rocky Mountain to
have permitted Mr. Fidler to have passed along the Eastern border of these
mountains as far S. as nearly 45° without even seeing it. but from hence as far as
Capt. C. had ascended the S. fork or Missouri being the distance of 55 Miles it's
course is S. 29° W. and it still appeared to bear considerably to the W. of South as
far as he could see it. I think therefore that we shall find that the Missouri enters the
rocky mountains to the North of 45° we did take the liberty of placing his discoveries
or at least the Southern extremity of them about a degree further N. in the sketh
which we sent on to the government this spring mearly from the Indian information
of the bearing from Fort Mandan of the entrance of the Missouri into the Rocky
Mountains, and I reather suspect that actual observation will take him at least one
other degree further North.
SUNDAY JUNE 9TH 1805.
We determined to deposite at this place the large red perogue all the heavy baggage
which we could possibly do without and some
1 Peter Fidler was a Hudson's Bay Company surveyor and explorer. In 1791
and 1792 he made a brilliant journey up the south branch of the Saskatchewan
River and along the foot of the Canadian Rockies, in Alberta. He was the first
white man to penetrate that region but he did not get as far south as 49°, still
less 45°. The Hudson's Bay Company turned over many of his data to the
London cartographer Aaron Arrowsmith, who made use of them when drawing
his famous map of North America, first published in 1795. Lewis and Clark
appear to have had with them copies of the 1795 and 1796 editions of the
Arrowsmith map: on both of them Fidler's route is, as Lewis's entry indicates,
shown far to the south of his actual journey.

Page 134
provision, salt, tools poweder and Lead &c; accordingly we set some hands to diging
a hole or cellar for the reception of our stores. these holes in the ground or deposits
are called by the engages cashes (cachés); today we examined our maps, and
compared the information derived as well from them as [from] the Indians and fully
settled in our minds the propryety of addopting the South fork for the Missouri, as
that which it would be most expedient for us to take. Those ideas as they occurred
to me I indevoured to impress on the minds of the party all of whom except Capt. C.
being still firm in the belief that the N. Fork was the Missouri and that which we
ought to take; they said very cheerfully that they were ready to follow us any wher
we thought proper to direct but that they still thought that the other was the river
and that they were affraid that the South fork would soon termineate in the
mountains and leave us at a great distance from the Columbia. finding them so
determined in this beleif, and wishing that if we were in an error to be able to detect
it and rectify it as soon as possible it was agreed between Capt. C. and myself that
one of us should set out with a small party by land up the South fork and continue
our rout up it until we found the falls or reached the snowy Mountains by which
means we should be enabled to determine this question prety accurately. this
expedition I prefered undertaking as Capt. C. [is the] best waterman &c and
determined to set out the day after tomorrow; I wished to make some further
observations at this place, and as we had determined to leave our blacksmith's
bellows and tools here it was necessary to repare some of our arms, and particularly
my Airgun the main spring of which was broken, before we left this place. these and
some other preperations will necessarily detain us two perhaps three days. I felt
myself very unwell this morning and took a portion of salts from which I feel much
relief this evening. most of the men are busily engaged dressing skins for cloathing.
In the evening Cruzatte gave us some music on the violin and the men passed the
evening dancing singing &c and were extreemly cheerfull.
[Clark] JUNE 10TH MONDAY 1805
we drew up our large Perogue into the middle of a small Island in the North fork and
covered her with bushes after makeing her fast to the trees, branded several trees to
prevent the Indians in-

Page 135
jureing her, Sahcahgagweâ our Indian woman verry sick I blead her, we deturmined
to assend the South fork, and Capt Lewis selects 4 men George Drewyer, Gibson,
Jo. Fields & S. Gutrich to accompany him & deturmine to set out in the morning. The
after noon or night cloudy some rain, river riseing a little.
[Lewis] TUESDAY JUNE 11TH 1805.
at 8 A.M. I swung my pack, and set forward with my little party. proceeded to the
point where Rose River a branch [of] Maria's River approaches the Missouri so
nearly. from this hight we discovered a herd of Elk on the Missouri just above us to
which we desended and soon killed four of them. we butchered them and hung up
the meat and skins in view of the river, but before the meal was prepared I was
taken with such violent pain in the intestens that I was unable to partake of the feast
of marrowbones. my pain still increased and towards evening was attended with a
high fever; finding myself unable to march, I determined to prepare a camp of some
willow boughs and remain all night. having brought no medicine with me I resolved
to try an experiment with some simples; and the Choke cherry which grew
abundantly in the bottom first struck my attention; I directed a parsel of the small
twigs to be geathered striped of their leaves, cut into pieces of about 2 Inches in
length and boiled in water untill a strong black decoction of an astringent bitter tast
was produced; at sunset I took a point [pint] of this decoction and abut an hour
after repeated the d[o]ze by 10 in the evening I was entirely releived from pain and
in fact every symptom of the disorder forsook me; my fever abated, a gentle
perspiration was produced and I had a comfortable and refreshing nights rest.
Goodrich who is remarkably fond of fishing caught several douzen fish of two
different species.
THURSDAY JUNE 13TH 1805.
we again ascended the hills of the river and gained the level country. the country
through which we passed for the first six miles tho' more roling than that we had
passed yesterday might still with propryety be deemed a level country; our course as
yesterday was generally S.W. the river from the place we left it

Page 136
appeared to make a considerable bend to the South. from the extremity of this roling
country I overlooked a most beatiful and level plain of great extent or at least 50 or
sixty miles; in this there were infinitely more buffaloe than I had ever before
witnessed at a view. nearly in the direction I had been travling or S.W. two curious
mountains presented themselves of square figures, the sides rising perpendicularly
to the hight of 250 feet and appeared to be formed of yellow clay; their tops
appeared to be level plains; fearing that the river boar to the South and that I might
pass the falls if they existed between this an[d] the snowey mountains I altered my
course nea[r]ly to the South leaving those insulated hills to my wright and proceeded
through the plain; I sent Feels on my right and Drewyer and Gibson on my left with
orders to kill some meat and join me at the river where I should halt for dinner. I had
proceded on this course about two miles with Goodrich at some distance behind me
whin my ears were saluted with the agreeable sound of a fall of water and advancing
a little further I saw the spray arrise above the plain like a collumn of smoke which
would frequently dispear again in an instant caused I presume by the wind which
blew pretty hard from the S.W. I did not however loose my direction to this point
which soon began to make a roaring too tremendious to be mistaken for any cause
short of the great falls of the Missouri. here I arrived about 12 OClock having
traveled by estimate about 15. Miles.
I took my position on the top of some rocks about 20 feet high opposite the center
of the falls. this chain of rocks appear once to have formed a part of those over
which the waters tumbled, but in the course of time has been seperated from it to
the distance of 150 yards lying prarrallel to it and a butment against which the water
after falling over the precipice beats with great fury; this barrier extends on the right
to the perpendicular clift which forms that board [border] of the river, but to the
distance of 120 yards next to the clift it is but a few feet above the level of the water,
and here the water in very high tides appears to pass in a channel of 40 yds. next to
the higher part of the ledg of rocks; on the left it extends within 80 or ninty yards of
the lard. Clift which is also perpendicular; between this abrupt extremity of the ledge
of rocks and the perpendicular bluff the whole body of water passes with incredible
swiftness.
immediately at the cascade the river is about 300 yds. wide; about

Page 137
ninty or a hundred yards of this next the Lard. bluff is a smoth even sheet of water
falling over a precipice of at least eighty feet, the remaining part of about 200 yards
on my right formes the grandest sight I ever beheld, the hight of the fall is the same
of the other but the irregular and somewhat projecting rocks below receives the
water in it's passage down and brakes it into a perfect white foam which assumes a
thousand forms in a moment sometimes flying up in jets of sparkling foam to the
hight of fifteen or twenty feet and are scarcely formed before large roling bodies of
the same beaten and foaming water is thrown over and conceals them. in short the
rocks seem to be most happily fixed to present a sheet of the whitest beaten froath
for 200 yards in length and about 80 feet perpendicular. the water after decending
strikes against the butment before mentioned or that on which I stand and seems to
reverberate and being met by the more impetuous courant they roll and swell into
half formed billows of great hight which rise and again disappear in an instant. this
butment of rock defends a handsome little bottom of about three acres which is
deversified and agreeably shaded with some cottonwood trees; in the lower
extremity of the bottom there is a very thick grove of the same kind of trees which
are small, in this wood there are several Indian lodges formed of sticks. a few small
cedar grow near the ledge of rocks where I rest. below the point of these rocks at a
small distance the river is divided by a large rock which rises several feet above the
water, and extends downwards with the stream for about 20 yards.
about a mile before the water arrives at the pitch it decends very rappidly, and is
confined on the Lard. side by a perpendicular clift of about 100 feet, on Stard. side it
is also perpendicular for about three hundred yards above the pitch where it is then
broken by the discharge of a small ravine, down which the buffaloe have a large
beaten road to the water, for it is but in very few places that these anamals can
obtain water near this place owing to the steep and inaccessible banks. about 300
yards below me there is another butment of solid rock with a perpendicular face and
abot 60 feet high which projects from the Stard. side at right angles to the distance
of 134 yds. and terminates the lower part nearly of the bottom before mentioned;
there being a passage arround the end of this butment between it and the river of
about 20 yards; here the river again assumes it's usual width soon

Page 138
spreading to near 300 yards but still continues it's rappidity. from the reflection of
the sun on the sprey or mist which arrises from these falls is a beautifull rainbow
produced which adds not a little to the beauty of this majestically grand senery.
after wrighting this imperfect discription I again viewed the falls and was so much
disgusted with the imperfect idea which it conveyed of the scene that I determined to
draw my pen across it and begin agin, but then reflected that I could not perhaps
succeed better than pening the first impressions of the mind; I retired to the shade
of a tree where I determined to fix my camp for the present and dispatch a man in
the morning to inform Capt. C. and the party of my success in finding the falls and
settle in their minds all further doubts as to the Missouri. the hunters now arrived
loaded with excellent buffaloe meat and informed me that they had killed three very
fat cows about 3\4 of a mile from hence. I walked down the river about three miles
to discover if possible some place to which the canoes might arrive or at which they
might be drawn on shore in order to be taken by land above the falls; but returned
without effecting either of these objects; the river was one continued sene of rappids
and cascades which I readily perceived could not be encountered with our canoes,
and the Clifts still retained their perpendicular structure and were from 150 to 200
feet high; in short the river appears here to have woarn a channel in the process of
time through a solid rock.
My fare is really sumptuous this evening; buffaloe's humps, tongues and
marrowbones, fine trout parched meal pepper and salt, and a good appetite; the last
is not considered the least of the luxuries.
FRIDAY JUNE 14TH 1805.
[On this day Lewis reconnoiters the remaining four falls and the intervening rapids
which compose the Great Falls, going as far as Sun River, which during the winter
they had named Medicine River. He is on the way to the latter as the entry
continues.2]
I decended the hill and directed my course to the bend of the
2 There are five falls in a ten-mile stretch of the river. The highest one is the
farthest upstream and is the one which Lewis here calls the Great Falls. Power
installations have entirely destroyed their beauty and spectacle.

Page 139
Missouri near which there was a herd of at least a thousand buffaloe; here I thought
it would be well to kill a buffaloe and leave him untill my return from the river and if I
then found that I had not time to get back to camp this evening to remain all night
here there being a few sticks of drift wood lying along shore which would answer for
my fire, and a few s[c]attering cottonwood trees a few hundred yards below which
would afford me at least the semblance of a shelter. under this impression I
scelected a fat buffaloe and shot him very well, through the lungs; while I was
gazeing attentively on the poor anamal discharging blood in streams from his mouth
and nostrils, expecting him to fall every instant, and having entirely forgotten to
reload my rifle, a large white, or reather brown bear, had perceived and crept on me
within 20 steps before I discovered him; in the first moment I drew up my gun to
shoot, but at the same instant recolected that she was not loaded and that he was
too near for me to hope to perform this opperation before he reached me, as he was
then briskly advancing on me; it was an open level plain, not a bush within miles nor
a tree within less than three hundred yards of me; the river bank was sloping and
not more than three feet above the level of the water; in short there was no place by
means of which I could conceal myself from this monster untill I could charge my
rifle; in this situation I thought of retreating in a brisk walk as fast as he was
advancing untill I could reach a tree about 300 yards below me, but I had no sooner
terned myself about but he pitched at me, open mouthed and full speed, I ran about
80 yards and found he gained on me fast, I then run into the water the idea struk me
to get into the water to such debth that I could stand and he would be obliged to
swim, and that I could in that situation defend myself with my espontoon;
accordingly I ran haistily into the water about waist deep, and faced about and
presented the point of my espontoon, at this instant he arrived at the edge of the
water within about 20 feet of me; the moment I put myself in this attitude of defence
he sudonly wheeled about as if frightened, declined to combat on such unequal
grounds, and retreated with quite as great precipitation as he had just before
pursued me.
As soon as I saw him run in that manner I returned to the shore and charged my
gun, which I had still retained in my hand throughout this curious adventure. I saw
him run through the

Page 140
level open plain about three miles, till he disappeared in the woods on medecine
river; during the whole of this distance he ran at full speed, sometimes appearing to
look behind him as if he expected pursuit. I now began to reflect on this novil
occurence and indeavoured to account for this sudden retreat of the bear. I at first
thought that perhaps he had not smelt me bofore he arrived at the waters edge so
near me, but I then reflected that he had pursued me for about 80 or 90 yards
before I took the water and on examination saw the grownd toarn with his tallons
immediately on the imp[r]ession of my steps; and the cause of his allarm still
remains with me misterious and unaccountable. so it was and I felt myself not a little
gratifyed that he had declined the combat. my gun reloaded I felt confidence once
more in my strength.
in returning through the level bottom of Medecine river and about 200 yards distant
from the Missouri, my direction led me directly to an anamal that I at first supposed
was a wolf; but on nearer approach or about sixty paces distant I discovered that it
was not, it's colour was a brownish yellow; it was standing near it's burrow, and
when I approached it thus nearly, it couched itself down like a cat looking
immediately at me as if it designed to spring on me. I took aim at it and fired, it
instantly disappeared in it's burrow; I loaded my gun and ex[a]mined the place
which was dusty and saw the track from which I am still further convinced that it
was of the tiger kind. whether I struck it or not I could not determine, but I am
almost confident that I did; my gun is true and I had a steady rest by means of my
espontoon, which I have found very serviceable to me in this way in the open plains.
It now seemed to me that all the beasts of the neighbourhood had made a league to
distroy me, or that some fortune was disposed to amuse herself at my expence, for I
had not proceded more than three hundred yards from the burrow of this tyger cat,
before three bull buffaloe, which wer feeding with a large herd about half a mile from
me on my left, seperated from the herd and ran full speed towards me, I thought at
least to give them some amusement and altered my direction to meet them; when
they arrived within a hundred yards they mad[e] a halt, took a good view of me and
retreated with precipitation. I then continued my rout homewards passed the
buffaloe which I

Page 141
had killed, but did not think it prudent to remain all might at this place which really
from the succession of curious adventures wore the impression on my mind of
inchantment; at sometimes for a moment I thought it might be a dream, but the
prickley pears which pierced my feet very severely once in a while, particularly after
it grew dark, convinced me that I was really awake, and that it was necessary to
make the best of my way to camp.
[Clark] JUNE 14TH FRIDAY 1805
a fine morning the Indian woman complaining all night & excessively bad this
morning. her case is somewhat dangerous. two men with the Tooth ake 2 with
Tumers, & one man with a Tumor & a slight fever passed the camp Capt. Lewis made
the 1st night at which place he had left part of two bear their skins &c. three men
with Tumers went on shore and stayed out all night one of them killed 2 buffalow, a
part of which we made use of for brackfast, the current excesevely rapid more so as
we assend we find great dificuelty in getting the Perogue & canoes up in safety,
canoes take in water frequently, at 4 oClock this evening Jo: Fields returned from
Capt. Lewis with a letter for me, Capt Lewis dates his letter from the Great falls of
the Missouri, which Fields informs me is about 20 miles in advance & about 10 miles
above the place I left the river the time I was up last week.
JUNE THE 15TH SATTURDAY 1805
we set out at the usial time and proceeded on with great dificuelty as the river is
more rapid we can hear the falls this morning verry distinctly. our Indian woman sick
& low spirited I gave her the bark & apply it exteranely to her region which revived
her much. the current excessively rapid and dificuelt to assend great numbers of
dangerous places, and the fatigue which we have to encounter is incretiatable the
men in the water from morning untill night hauling the cord & boats walking on sharp
rocks and round sliperery stones which alternately cut their feet & throw them down,
notwith standing all this dificuelty they go

Page 142
with great chearfulness, aded to those dificuelties the rattle snakes inumerable &
require great caution to prevent being bitten.
[Lewis] SUNDAY JUNE 16TH 1805.
at noon the men arrived and shortly after I set out with them to rejoin the party, we
took with us the dryed meat consisting of about 600 lbs. and several douzen of
dryed trout. about 2 P.M. I reached the camp found the Indian woman extreemly ill
and much reduced by her indisposition. this gave me some concern as well for the
poor object herself, then with a young child in her arms, as from the consideration of
her being our only dependence for a friendly negociation with the Snake Indians on
whom we depend for horses to assist us in our portage from the Missouri to the
columbia river. I now informed Capt. C. of my discoveries with rispect to the most
proper side for our portage, and of it's great length, which I could not estimate at
less than 16 miles. Capt. C. had already sent two men this morning to examine the
country on the S. side of the river; he now passed over with the party to that side
and fixed a camp about a mile blow the entrance of a Creek where there was a
sufficient quantity of wood for fuel, an article which can be obtained but in few places
in this neighbourhood.
after discharging the loads four of the canoes were sent back to me, which by means
of strong ropes we hawled above the rappid and passed over to the south side from
whence the water not being rappid we can readily convey them into the creek by
means of which we hope to get them on the high plain with more ease. one of the
small canoes was left below this rappid in order to pass and repass the river for the
purpose of hunting as well as to procure the water of the Sulpher spring, the virtues
of which I now resolved to try on the Indian woman. Capt. Clark determined to set
out in the morning to examine (the country) and survey the portage, and discover
the best rout. as the distance was too great to think of transporting the canoes and
baggage on the men's shoulders, we scelected six men, and ordered them to look
out some timber this evening, and early in the morning to set about making a parsel
of truck wheels in order to convey our canoes and baggage over the portage. we
determined to leave the

Page 143
white perogue at this place, and substitute the Iron boat, and also to make a further
deposit of a part of our stores. I found that two dozes of barks and opium which I
had given her [Sacajawea] since my arrival had produced an alteration in her pulse
for the better; they were now much fuller and more regular. I caused her to drink the
mineral water altogether. she complains principally of the lower region of the
abdomen, I therefore continued the cataplasms of barks and laudnumn which had
been previously used by my friend Capt. Clark. I beleive her disorder originated
principally from an obstruction of the mensis in consequence of taking could.
MONDAY JUNE 17TH 1805.
Capt. Clark set out early this morning with five me[n] to examine the country and
survey the river and portage as had been concerted last evening. I set six men at
work to p[r]epare four sets of truck wheels with couplings, toungs and bodies, that
they might either be used without the bodies for transporting our canoes, or with
them in transporting our baggage. we were fortunate enough to find one cottonwood
tree just below the entrance of portage creek that was large enough to make our
carriage wheels about 22 Inchis in diameter; fortunate I say because I do not beleive
that we could find another of the same size perfectly sound within 20 miles of us. the
cottonwood which we are obliged to employ in the other parts of the work is
extreemly illy calculated for it being soft and brittle. we have made two axeltrees of
the mast of the white perogue, which I hope will answer tolerably well tho' it is
reather small. The Indian woman much better today; I have still continued the same
course of medecine; she is free from pain clear of fever, her pulse regular, and eats
as heartily as I am willing to permit her of broiled buffaloe well seasoned with pepper
and salt and rich soope of the same meat; I think therefore that there is every
rational hope of her recovery.
[Clark] JUNE 18TH TUESDAY 1805
this evening, one man A. Willard going for a load of meat at 170 yards distance on
an Island was attact by a white bear and

Page 144
verry near being caught, prosued within 40 yards of the camp where I was with one
man I collected 3 others of the party and prosued the bear (who had prosued my
track from a buffalow I had killed on the Island at about 300 yards distance and
chance[d] to meet Willard) for fear of his attacking one man Colter at the lower point
of the Island. before we had got down the bear had allarmed the man and prosued
him into the water, at our approach he retreated, and we relieved the man in the
water, I saw the bear but the bushes was so thick that I could not shoot him and it
was nearly dark,
JUNE 20TH THURSDAY 1805
I direct stakes to be cut to stick up in the praries to show the way for the party to
transport the baggage &c. &c. we set out early on the portage, soon after we set out
it began to rain and continued a short time we proceeded on thro' a tolerable leavel
plain, and found the hollow of a Deep riveen to obstruct our rout as it could not be
passed with canos & baggage for some distance above the place we struck it. I
examined it for some time and finding it late deturmined to strike the river & take its
Course & distance to camp which I accordingly did the wind hard from the S.W. a fair
after noon, the river on both sides cut with raveens some of which is passes thro
steep clifts into the river, the countrey above the falls & up the Medison river is level,
with low banks, a chain of mountains to the west some part of which particller those
to the N W. & S W are covered with snow and appear verry high. I saw a rattle snake
in an open plain 2 miles from any creek or woods. When I arrived at camp found all
well with quantites of meet, the canoes Capt Lewis had carried up the Creek 1 3/4
miles to a good place to assend the land & taken up. Not haveing seen the Snake
Indians or knowing in fact whither to calculate on their friendship or hostillity, we
have conceived our party sufficiently small, and therefore have concluded not to
dispatch a canoe with a part of our men to St. Louis as we have entended early in
the Spring.3 we fear also that
3 In the report sent to Jefferson from Fort Mandan, the captains had
announced their intention of sending another one from the Great Falls. The
failure of one to arrive convinced the settlements that the whole party had
perished.

Page 145
such a measure might also discourage those who would in such case remain, and
migh possibly hazard the fate of the expedition. We have never hinted to any one of
the party that we had such a scheem in contemplation, and all appear perfectly to
have made up their minds to Succeed in the expedition or perish in the attempt. We
all believe that we are about to enter on the most perilous and dificuelt part of our
Voyage, yet I see no one repineing; all appear ready to meet those dificuelties which
await us with resolution and becomeing fortitude.
the Mountains to the N.W. and West of us are still entirely covered are white and
glitter with the reflection of the sun. I do not believe that the clouds that pervale at
this season of the year reach the summits of those lofty mountains; and if they do
the probability is that they deposit snow only for there has been no proceptable
diminution of the snow which they contain since we first saw them. I have thought it
probable that these mountains might have derived their appellation of Shineing
Mountains, from their glittering appearance when the sun shines in certain directions
on the snow which cover them.
Dureing the time of my being on the Plains and above the falls I as also all my party
repeatedly heard a nois which proceeded from a Direction a little to the N. of West, a
loud [noise] and resembling precisely the discharge of a piece of ordinance of 6
pounds at the distance of 5 or six miles. I was informed of it several times by the
men J: Fields particularly before I paid any attention to it, thinking it was thunder
most probably which they had mistaken. at length walking in the plains yesterday
near the most extreem S. E bend of the River above the falls I heard this nois very
distinctly, it was perfectly calm clear and not a cloud to be seen, I halted and listened
attentively about two hour[s] dureing which time I heard two other discharges, and
took the direction of the sound with my pocket compass which was as nearly West
from me as I could estimate from the sound. I have no doubt but if I had leasure I
could find from whence it issued. I have thought it probable that it might be caused
by running water in some of the caverns of those emence mountains, on the
principal of the blowing caverns; but in such case the sounds would be periodical
and regular, which is not the case with this, being sometimes heard once only and at
other times several discharges in quick succession. it is heard also at different times
of the day

Page 146
and night. I am at a great loss to account for this Phenomenon. I well recollect
hereing the Minitarees say that those Rocky mountains make a great noise, but they
could not tell me the cause, neither could they inform me of any remarkable
substance or situation in these mountains which would autherise a conjecture of a
probable cause of this noise.

Page 147

Chapter XI
Portaging Around the Great Falls
From June 21 to July 15 the expedition remained at the Great Falls, transporting the
equipment across the portage and preparing for the next stage of the journey. It
was a period of strenuous labor the most strenuous so far and of even more violent
weather.
Clark surveyed what he considered the easiest route for the portage. Its upper end
was near the base camp they made opposite an island which they called White Bear
because it was infested with grizzlies, upstream from the mouth of Medicine (Sun)
River. From Portage Creek, where they beached the boats, concealed the remaining
pirogue, and laboriously carried the dugouts up the side of the sunken valley, the
distance was 18 1\4 miles. It was a comparatively level stretch but was carpeted
with cactus. The party's only footwear by now was moccasins, and they had learned
to sew to them double soles of parfleche, buffalo rawhide, as the Plains Indians did.
(The moccasins of forest tribes did not have stiff soles.) But no rawhide was thick
enough to turn the cactus and everyone had viciously sore feet.
Over this portage they hauled both the dugouts and the equipment on the two crude
truck frames which they had made of cottonwood. (When the tongue, hounds, and
an axle of one broke, they were replaced with the somewhat tougher wood of willow
trees, which grew abundantly along the streams.) After the necessary detachments
for hunting and the construction of Lewis's collapsible bullboat had been made,
there were just enough men left to haul the trucks. Clark wrote that ''the men has to
haul with all their strength wate & art, maney times every man all

Page 148
catching the grass & knobes [tufts? hummocks?] & stones with their hands to give
them more force in drawing on the Canoes & Loads, and notwithstanding the
coolness of the air in high presperation and every halt, those not employed in
reparing the course, are asleep in a moment, maney limping from the soreness of
their feet some become fa[i]nt for a fiew moments, but no man complains all go
chearfully on. to state the fatigues of this party would take up more of the journal
than other notes which I find scarcely time to set down.''
On his way to the Great Falls Lewis had noted the abundance of buffalo and
grizzlies. One herd of the former, Clark said, numbered ten thousand, and there
were so many of the latter and they became so "troublesome that I [Lewis] do not
think it prudent to send one man alone on an errand of any kind." One charged
Joseph Fields and he was able to escape only by leaping into the river and crouching
under an overhanging bank. Another chased Drewyer for a hundred yards after he
had shot it through the heart. But all this game there were large herds of elk and
antelope as well meant that the party lived high. After leaving the Missouri,
especially in the Bitterroot Mountains where there was no game at all and along the
Columbia where they had to live on salmon, they were to remember this area with
the longing of hungry men. The captains were prepared for the short rations to
come, having been told by the Minnetarees that there were no buffalo west of the
mountains.
"I have scarcely experienced a day since my first arrival in this quarter," Lewis
wrote, "without experiencing some novel occurrence among the party or witnessing
the appearance of some uncommon object." One unpleasant feature was the sudden
storms. They filled the runoff channels that gullied the portage route and made the
clayey soil an impassable glue. Sometimes the rains were preceded by hail so fierce
that everyone had to take shelter from it. Once "at Capt. Lewis camp" it was "7
Inches in circumference & waied 3 ounces, fortunately for us it was not so large
[along the portage route], if it had [been] we should most certainly have fallen
victims to its rage as the men were mostly naked, and but a few with hats or any
covering on their heads." And, ''the same cloud will discharge hail in one part hail
and rain in another and rain only in a third within the space of a few miles." Or a
gale

Page 149
would blow up and chill everyone; at least once "the men informed me that they
hoisted a sail in the canoe and it had driven her along on the truck wheels."
Everyone was wearing buckskin rather elkskin shirts and breeches now. A supply of
them had to be built up in this wonderland of game for there was no telling what lay
ahead. There was a brief pause for celebration on July 4 but it had a melancholy
overtone: the grog which the captains issued was the last alcohol they had.
And Lewis's prized bullboat on an iron frame proved a failure. He kept a detachment
working on it steadily and he invented many expedients, but when it was finally put
in the water, it leaked too badly to be used. He attributed the failure to lack of
proper gum to pay the seams and to the fact that his awls were of the wrong shape
and so the holes they made (through which the sinew that joined the hides was
threaded) could not be filled. It is likely however, that hides could not have been, in
any circumstances, satisfactorily attached to a rigid frame. Lewis had been
enamored of his invention and was much depressed. He had expected the boat to be
able to carry at least four tons of lading, and two new dugouts had to be made to
take its place. It was characteristic of this vexatious place that axe helves kept
breaking, thirteen of them in one day. Wild cherry proved to be the best wood to
make replacements of.
(The text that follows has been much abbreviated. The chapter runs fifty-one pages
in the Journals.)
[Lewis] WEDNESDAY JUNE 26TH 1805.
The Musquetoes are extreemly troublesome to us. This morning early I dispatched J.
Fields and Drewyer in one of the canoes up the river to hunt Elk. set Frazier at work
to sew the skins together for the covering of the boat. Sheilds and Gas I sent over
the river to surch a small timbered bottom on that side opposite to the Islands for
timber and bark; and myself I assign the duty of cook as well for those present as
for the party which I expect again to arrive this evening from the lower camp. I
collected my wood and water, boiled a large quantity of excellent dryed buffaloe
meat and made each man a large suet dumpling by way of a treat.

Page 150
about 4 P.M. Shields and Gass returned with a better supply of timber than they had
yet collected tho' not by any means enough. they brought some bark principally of
the Cottonwood which I found was too brittle and soft for the purpose; for this
article I find my only dependence is the sweet willow which has a tough & strong
bark. Shields and Gass had killed seven buffaloe in their absence, the skins of which
and a part of the best of the meat they brought with them. if I cannot procure a
sufficient quantity of Elk's skins I shall substitute those of the buffaloe. late in the
evening the party arrived with two more canoes and another portion of the baggage.
Whitehouse one of them much heated and fortiegued on his arrivall d[r]ank a very
hearty draught of water and was taken almost instantly extreemly ill. his pulse were
full and I therefore bled him plentifully from which he felt great relief. I had no other
instrument with which to perform this operation but my penknife, however it
answered very well. the wind being from S.E. today and favourable the men made
considerable progress by means of their sails.
At the lower Camp. Capt. C. scelected the articles to be deposited in the cash
consisting of my desk which I had left for that purpose and in which I had left some
books, my specimens of plants minerals &c. collected from fort Mandan to that
place. also 2 Kegs of Pork, 1\2 a Keg of flour 2 blunderbushes, 1\2 a keg of fixed
ammunition and some other small articles belonging to the party which could be
dispenced with. deposited the swivel and carriage under the rocks a little above the
camp near the river.
THURSDAY JUNE 27TH 1805.
The party returned early this morning for the remaining canoe and baggage;
Whitehouse was not quite well this morning I therefore detained him and about 10
A.M. set him at work with Frazier sewing the skins together for the boat; Shields and
gass continued the operation of shaving and fiting the horizontall bars of wood in the
sections of the boat; the timber is so crooked and indifferent that they make but little
progress, for myself I continued to act the part of cook in order to keep all hands
employed. some Elk came near our camp and we killed 2 of them. at 1 P.M. a cloud
arrose to the S.W. and shortly after came on attended with

Page 151
violent Thunder Lightning and hail &c. soon after this storm was over Drewyer and J.
Fields returned. They were about 4 miles above us during the storm, the hail was of
no uncommon size where they were. They had killed 9 Elk and three bear during
their absence; one of the bear was the largest by far that we have yet seen; the skin
appear[s] to me to be as large as a common ox. while hunting they saw a thick
brushey bottom on the bank of the river where from the tracks along shore they
suspected that there were bare concealed; they therefore landed without making any
nois and climbed a leaning tree and placed themselves on it's branches about 20 feet
above the ground, when thus securely fixed they gave a [w]hoop and this large bear
instantly rushed forward to the place from whence he had heard the human voice
issue, when he arrived at the tree he made a short paus and Drewyer shot him in the
head. it is worthy of remark that these bear never climb. the fore feet of this bear
measured nine inches across and the hind feet eleven and 3\4 in length exclusive of
the tallons and seven inches in width. a bear came within thirty yards of our camp
last night and eat up about thirty weight of buffaloe suit which was hanging on a
pole. my dog seems to be in a constant state of alarm with these bear and keeps
barking all night.
[Clark] JUNE 29TH SATTURDAY 1805
a little rain verry early this morning after[wards] clear, finding that the Prarie was so
wet as to render it impossible to pass on to the end of the portage, deturmined to
send back to the top of the hill at the creek for the remaining part of the baggage left
at that place yesterday, leaveing one man to take care of the baggage at this place. I
deturmined my self to proceed to the falls and take the river, according we all set
out, I took my servent & one man, Chabono our Interpreter & his Squar
accompanied, soon after I arrived at the falls, I perceived a cloud which appeared
black and threaten imediate rain, I looked out for a shelter but could see no place
without being in great danger of being blown into the river if the wind should prove
as turbelant as it is at some times about 1\4 of a mile above the falls I obsd a Deep
riveen in which was shelveing rocks under which we took shelter near the river and
placed our guns the compass &c. &c. under a shelving rock on the upper side of the
creek, in a place

Page 152
which was verry secure from rain, the first shower was moderate accompanied with
a violent wind, the effects of which we did not feel, soon after a torrent of rain and
hail fell more violent than ever I saw before, the rain fell like one voley of water
falling from the heavens and gave us time only to get out of the way of a torrent of
water which was Poreing down the hill in the River with emence force tareing
everything before it takeing with it large rocks & mud, I took my gun & shot pouch in
my left hand, and with the right scrambled up the hill pushing the Interpreters wife
(who had her child in her arms) before me, the Interpreter himself makeing attempts
to pull up his wife by the hand much scared and nearly without motion, we at length
reached the top of the hill safe where I found my servent in serch of us greatly
agitated, for our wellfar. before I got out of the bottom of the reveen which was a
flat dry rock when I entered it, the water was up to my waste & wet my watch, I
scercely got out before it raised 10 feet deep with a torrent which [was] turrouble to
behold, and by the time I reached the top of the hill, at least 15 feet water,
I derected the party to return to the camp at the run as fast as possible to get to our
Lode where Clothes could be got to cover the child whose clothes were all lost, and
the woman who was but just recovering from a severe indisposition, and was wet
and cold, I was fearfull of a relaps I caused her as also the others of the party to
take a little spirits, which my servent had in a canteen, which revived [them] verry
much. on arrival at the camp on the willow run met the party who had returned in
great confusion to the run leaveing their loads in the Plain, the hail & wind being so
large and violent in the plains, and them naked, they were much brused, and some
nearly killed one knocked down three times, and others without hats or any thing on
their heads bloody & complained verry much, I refreshed them with a little grog.
Soon after the run began to rise and rose 6 feet in a fiew minets. I lost at the river in
the torrent the large compas, an elegant fusee, Tomahawk Humbrallo, [Umbrella]
shot pouch & horn with powder & Ball, Mockersons, & the woman lost her childs
Bear1 & Clothes bedding &c. The Compass, is a serious loss, as we have no other
large one.

[Lewis] SUNDAY JUNE 30TH 1805.
I begin to be extremely impatient to be off as the season is now waisting a pace
nearly three months have now elapsed since we left Fort Mandan and not yet
reached the Rocky Mountains I am therefore fully preswaded that we shall not reach
Fort Mandan again this season if we even return from the ocean to the Snake
Indians.
[Clark] JUNE 30TH SUNDAY 1805
The two men dispatched in serch of the articles lost yesterday returned and brought
the compass which they found in the mud & stones near the mouth of the reveen, no
other articles found, the place I sheltered under filled up with hugh Rocks.
[Lewis] TUESDAY JULY 9TH 1805
we corked [caulked] the canoes and put them in the water and also launched the
boat; she lay like a perfect cork on the water. five men would carry her with the
greatest ease. I now directed seats to be fixed in her and oars to be fitted. the men
loaded the canoes in readiness to depart. just at this moment a violent wind
commenced and blew so hard that we were obliged to unload the canoes again; a
part of the baggage in several of them got wet before it could be taken out. the wind
continued violent untill late in the evening, by which time we discovered that a
greater part of the composition had separated from the skins and left the seams of
the boat exposed to the water and she leaked in such manner that she would not
answer. I need not add that this circumstance mortifyed me not a little; and to
prevent her leaking without pi[t]ch was impossible with us, and to obtain this article
was equally impossible, therefore the evil was irraparable I now found that the
section formed of the buffaloe hides on which some hair had been left, answered
much the best purpose; this leaked but little and the parts which were well covered
with hair about 1\8th of an inch in length retained the composition perfectly and
remained sound and dry. from these circumstances I am preswaided, that had I
formed her with buffaloe skins singed not

Page 154
quite as close as I had done those I employed, that she would have answered even
with this composition. but to make any further experiments in our present situation
seemed to me madness; the buffaloe had principally dserted us, and the season was
now advancing fast. I therefore relinquished all further hope of my favorite boat and
ordered her to be sunk in the water, that the skins might become soft in order the
better to take her in peices tomorrow and deposited the iron fraim at this place as it
could probably be of no further service to us.
FRIDAY JULY 12TH 1805.
Musquetoes extreemly troublesome to me today nor is a large knat less troublesome
which does not sting, but attacks the eye in swarms and compells us to brush them
off or have our eyes filled with them.

From the Great Falls to the Three Forks
[Lewis] MONDAY JULY 15TH 1805
We arrose very early this morning, assigned the canoes their loads and had it put on
board. we now found our vessels eight in number all heavily laden, notwithstanding
our several deposits; tho' it is true we have now a considerable stock of dryed meat
and grease. we find it extreemly difficult to keep the baggage of many of our men
within reasonable bounds; they will be adding bulky articles of but little uce or value
to them. At 10 A.M. we once more saw ourselves fairly under way much to my joy
and I beleive that of every individual who compose the party. I walked on shore and
killed 2 Elk near one of which the party halted and dined. in order to lighten the
burthen of the canoes I continued my walk all the evening and took our only
invaledes Potts an La Page with me. we passed the river near where we dined and
just above the entrance of a beautifull river 80 yards wide which falls in on the Lard.
side in honour of Mr. Robert Smith the Secretary of the Navy we called Smith's River.

drowned it and brought it to shore at our camp. the prickly pear is now in full blume
and forms one of the beauties as well as the greatest pests of the plains. the
sunflower is also in blume and is abundant. this plant is common to every part of the
Missouri from it's entrance to this place. the lambsquarter, wild coucumber, sand

the banks of the river there are many large banks of sand much elivated above the
plains on which they ly and appear as if they had been collected in the course of time
from the river by the almost incessant S.W. winds; they always appear on the sides
of the river opposite to those winds.
TUESDAY JULY 16TH 1805.
Drewyer killed a buffaloe this morning near the river and we halted and breakfasted
on it. here for the first time I ate of the small guts of the buffaloe cooked over a
blazing fire in the Indian stile without any preperation of washing or other clensing
and found them very good. After breakfast I determined to leave Capt. C. and party,
and go on to the point where the river enters the Rocky Mountains and make the
necessary observations against their arrival; accordingly I set out with the two
invalleds Potts and LaPage and Drewyer.

[Lewis] THURSDAY JULY 18TH 1805.
previous to our departure saw a large herd of the Bighorned anamals on the
immencely high and nearly perpendicular clift opposite to us; on the fase of this clift
they walked about and bounded from rock to rock with apparent unconcern where it
appared to me that no quadruped could have stood, and from which had they made
one false step the must have been precipitated at least a 500 feet. this anamal
appears to frequent such precepices and clifts where in fact they are perfectly secure
from the pursuit of the wolf, bear, or even man himself. at the distance of 2 1/2
miles we passed the entrance of a considerable river on the Stard. side; about 80
yds wide being nearly as wide as the Missouri at that place. it's current is rapid and
water extreamly transparent; the bed is formed of small smooth stones of flat
rounded or other figures. it's bottoms are narrow but possess as much timber as the
Missouri. the country is

mountainous and broken through which it passes. it appears as if it might be
navigated but to what extent must be conjectural. this handsome bold and clear
stream we named in honor of the Secretary of war calling it Dearborn's river.
as we were anxious now to meet with the Sosonees or snake Indians as soon as
possible in order to obtain information relative to the geography of the country and
also if necessary, some horses we thought it better for one of us either Capt. C. or
myself to take a small party & proceed on up the river some distance before the
canoes, in order to discover them, should they be on the river before the daily
discharge of our guns, which was necessary in procuring subsistence for the party,
should allarm and cause them to retreat to the mountains and conceal themselves,
supposing us to be their enemies who visit them usually by the way of this river.
accordingly Capt. Clark set out this morning after breakfast with Joseph Fields, Pots
and his servant York. we proceeded on tolerably well; the current stronger than
yesterday; we employ the cord and oars principally tho' sometimes the setting pole.
[Clark] JULY 18TH THURSDAY 1805
after brackfast I took J. Fields Potts & my Servent proceeded on. the Country So
Hilley that we gained but little of the Canoes untill in the evening I passed over a
mountain on an Indian rode by which rout I cut off Several Miles of the Meanderings
of the river. the roade which passes this mountain is wide and appears to have been
dug in maney places, we camped on a Small run of Clear cold water, musquitors
verry troublesom the forepart of the evening I Saw maney fine Springs & Streams of
running water which Sink & rise alternately in the Valies the water of those Streams
are fine, those streams which run off into the river are damed up by the beaver from
near ther mouthes up as high as I could See up them
[Lewis] FRIDAY JULY 19TH 1805.
this morning we set out early and proceeded on very well tho' the water appears to
encrease in volocity as we advance. the current has been strong all day and
obstructed with some rapids, tho' these

Page 160
are but little broken by rocks and are perfectly safe. the river deep and from 100 to
150 yds. wide. I walked along shore today and killed an Antelope. wh[en]ever we
get a view of the lofty summits of the mountains the snow presents itself, altho' we
are almost suffocated in this confined valley with heat. this evening we entered much
the most remarkable clifts that we have yet seen. these clifts rise from the waters
edge on either side perpendicularly to the hight of 1200 feet. every object here
wears a dark and gloomy aspect. the tow[er]ing and projecting rocks in many places
seem ready to tumble on us. the river appears to have forced it's way through this
immence body of solid rock for the distance of 5 3/4 Miles and where it makes it's
exit below has th[r]own on either side vast collumns of rocks mountains high.
the river appears to have woarn a passage just the width of it's channel or 150 yds.
it is deep from side to side nor is there in the 1st 3 Miles of this distance a spot
except one of a few yards in extent on which a man could rest the soal of his foot.
several fine springs burst out at the waters edge from the interstices of the rocks. it
happens fortunately that altho' the current is strong it is not so much so but what it
may be overcome with the oars for there is hear no possibility of using either the
cord or Setting pole. it was late in the evening before I entered this place and was
obliged to continue my rout untill sometime after dark before I found a place
sufficiently large to encamp my small party; at length such an one occurred on the
lard. side where we found plenty of lightwood and pich pine. this rock is a black
grannite below and appears to be of a much lighter colour above and from the
fragments I take it to be flint of a yellowish brown and light creem-coloured yellow.
from the singular appearance of this place I called it the gates of the rocky
mounatains.
[Clark] JULY 19TH FRYDAY 1805
I proceeded on in an Indian Parth river verry Crooked passed over two mountains
Saw Several Indians Camps which they have left this Spring. Saw trees Peeled &
found poles &c. at 11 oC. I saw a gange of Elk, as we had no provision Concluded to
kill Some. Killd. two and dined being oblige[d] to substitute dry buffalow dung in
place of wood, this evening passed over a

[Lewis] SATURDAY 20TH 1805
about 10 A.M. we saw the smoke arrise as if the country had been set on fire up the
valley of this creek about 7 Mi. distant we were at a loss to determine whether it had
been set on fire by the natives as a signall among themselves on discovering us, as
is their custom or whether it had been set on fire by Capt. C. and party accedentally.
the first however proved to be the fact, they had unperceived by us discovered Capt.
Clark's party or mine, and had set the plain on fire to allarm the more distant natives
(heard a gun from Cap C's party & fled quite over the mountains, thinking it their
enemies Blackfoots.) and fled themselves further into the interior of the mountains.
this evening we found the skin of an Elk and part of the flesh of the anamal which
Capt. C. had left near the river at the upper side of the valley where he assended the
mountain with a note informing me of his transactions and that he should pass the
mounts which lay just above us and wate our arrival at some convenient place on
the river. the other elk which Capt. C. had killed we could not find. about 2. in the
evening we had passed through a range of low mountains and the country became
more open again, tho' still broken and untimbered and the bottoms not very
extensive. we encamped on the Lard. side near a spring on a high bank the prickly
pears are so abundant that we could scarcely find room to lye.
SUNDAY JULY 21ST 1805.
Set out early this morning and passed a bad rappid where the river enters the
mountain about 1.M. from our camp of last evening the Clifts high and covered with
fragments of broken

Page 162
rocks. the current strong; we employed the toe rope principally; and also the poles
as the river is not now so deep but reather wider and much more rapid our progress
was therefore slow and laborious. we saw three swans this morning, which like the
geese have not yet recovered the feathers of the wing and could not fly we killed two
of them the third escaped by diving and passed down with the current; they had no
young ones with them therefore presume they do not breed in this country these are
the first we have seen on the river for a great distance. we daily see great numbers
of gees with their young which are perfectly feathered except the wings which are
deficient in both young and old. My dog caught several today, as he frequently dose.
the young ones are very fine, but the old gees are poor and unfit for uce. saw
several of the large brown or sandhill Crain today with their young. the young Crain
is as large as a turkey and cannot fly they are of a bright red bey colour or that of
the common deer at this season. the grass near the river is lofty and green that of
the hill sides and high open grounds is perfectly dry and appears to be scorched by
the heat of the sun. the country was rough mountainous & much as that of
yesterday untill towards evening when the river entered a beautiful and extensive
plain country of about 10 or 12 miles wide which extended upwards further that the
eye could reach this valley is bounded by two nearly parallel ranges of high
mountains which have their summits partially covered with snow. below the snowey
region pine succeeds and reaches down their sides in some parts to the plain but
much the greater portion of their surfaces is uncovered with timber and expose
either a barren sterile soil covered with dry parched grass or black and rugged rocks.
the river immediately on entering this valley assumes a different aspect and
character, it spreads to a mile and upwards in width, crouded with Islands, some of
them large; is shallow enough for the use of the seting pole in almost every part and
still more rappid than before.
[Clark] JULY 21ST SUNDAY 1805
a fine morning our feet So brused and cut that I deturmined to delay for the Canoes,
& if possible kill Some meet by the time they arrived, Small birds are plenty. Some
Deer, Elk, Goats, and

of them rocky: Vallies firtile I observe on the highest pinecals of some of the

Snow and cant be Seen from this point
[Lewis] MONDAY JULY 22D 1805.
The river being divided into such a number of channels by both large and small
Island[s] that I found it impossible to lay it down [the courses] correctly following
one channel only in a canoe and therefore walked on shore I met with great
quantities of a smal onion about the size of a musquit ball and some even larger;
they were white crisp and well flavored I geathered about half a bushel of them
before the canoes arrived. I halted the party for breakfast and the men also
geathered considerable quantities of those onions. [In the afternoon] I kiled an otter
which sunk to the bottom on being shot, a circumstance unusual with that anamal.
the water was about 8 feet deep yet so clear that I could see it at the bottom; I
swam in and obtained it by diving. I halted the party here for dinner; I placed my
thermometer in a good shade as was my custom about 4. P. M. and after dinner set
out without it and had proceeded near a mile before I recollected it I sent Sergt.
Ordway back for it, he found it and brought it on. the murcury stood at 80 a. 0 this is
the warmest day except one which we have experienced this summer. The Indian
woman recognizes the country and assures us that this is the river on which her
relations live, and that the three forks are at no great distance. this peice of
information has cheered the sperits of the party who now begin to console
themselves with the anticipation of shortly seeing the head of the missouri yet
unknown to the civilized world.
late this evening we arrived at Capt. Carks camp on the stard. side of the river; we
took them on board with the meat they had collected and proceeded a short distance
and encamped on an Island Capt. Clark's party had killed a deer and an Elk today
and ourselves one deer and an Antelope only. altho' Capt C. was much fatiegued his
feet yet blistered and soar he insisted on pursuing his rout in the morning nor weould
he consent willingly to my releiving him at that time by taking a tour of the same
kind.

Page 164
finding him anxious I readily consented to remain with the canoes, he ordered
Frazier and Jo. & Reubin Fi[e]lds to hold themselves in readiness to accompany him
in the morning. Sharbono was anxious to accompany him and was accordingly
permitted. the musquetoes and knats more than usually troublesome to us this
evening.
TUESDAY JULY 23RD 1805
Capt. Clark left us with his little party of 4 men and continued his rout on the Stard.
side of the river. about 10'OCk. A.M. we came up with Drewyer who had seperated
from us yesterday evening and lay out all night not being able to find where we had
encamped. he had killed 5 deer which we took on board I ordered the canoes to
hoist their small flags in order that should the indians see us they might discover that
we were not Indians, nor their enemies. we made great uce of our seting poles and
cords the uce of both which the river and banks favored. most of our small sockets
were lost, and the stones were so smooth that the points of their poles sliped in such
manner that it increased the labour of navigating the canoes very considerably,

the adjacent mountains3 commonly rise so high as to conceal the more distant and
lofty mountains from our view. I fear every day that we shall meet with some
considerable falls or obstruction in the river notwithstanding the information of the
Indian woman to the contrary who assures us that the river continues much as we
see it. I can scarcely form an idea of a river runing to great extent
3 The ''adjacent'' mountains are the Big Belts to the east and the Bridger Range
to the southeast. To the west is a small range called the Elk Horns.

Page 165
through such a rough mountainous country without having it's stream intersepted by
some difficult and dangerous rappids or falls. we daily pass a great number of small
rappids or riffles which decend one to or 3 feet in 150 yards but we are rarely
incommoded with fixed or standing rocks and altho' strong rappid water are
nevertheless quite practicable & by no means dangerous.
our trio of pests still invade and obstruct us on all occasions, these are the
Musquetoes eye knats and prickley pears, equal to any three curses that ever poor
Egypt laiboured under, except the Mahometant yoke. the men complain of being
much fortiegued. their labour is excessively great. I occasionly encourage them by
assisting in the labour of navigating the canoes, and have learned to push a tolerable
good pole in their fraize.
[Clark] JULY 25TH THURSDAY 1805
a fine morning we proceeded on a fiew miles to the three forks of the Missouri those
three forks are nearly of a Size, the North fork appears to have the most water and
must be Considered as the one best calculated for us to assend4 Middle fork is quit
as large about 90 yds. wide. The South fork is about 70 yds wide & falls in about 400
yards below the midle fork those forks appear to be verry rapid & contain some
timber in their bottoms which is verry extencive. on the North Side the Indians have
latterly Set the Praries on fire, the Cause I can't account for. I saw one horse track
going up the river, about four or 5 days past. after Brackfast (which we made on the
ribs of a Buck killed yesterday), I wrote a note informing Capt. Lewis the rout I
intended to take, and proceeded on up the main North fork thro' a Vallie, the day
verry hot,
We Campd on the Same Side we assended Starboard 20 miles on a direct line up the
N. fork. Shabono our Interpreter nearly tired [out] one of his ankles falling him. The
bottoms are extencive and tolerable land covered with tall grass & prickley pears.
The hills & mountains are high Steep & rockey. The river verry much di4 Presently to be named Jefferson River. Clark's almost instantaneous decision
to ascend is due not only to its greater flow, but to the fact that it leads more

current strong with frequent riffles; employ the cord and seting poles, the oars
scarcely ever being used the high lands are thin meagre soil covered with dry low
sedge and a species of grass also dry the seeds of which are armed with a long
twisted hard beard at the upper extremity while the lower point is a sharp subulate,
firm point beset at it's base with little stiff bristles standing with their points in a
contrary direction to the subulate point to which they answer as a barb and serve
also to pres it forward when onece entered a small distance. these barbed seed
penetrate our mockersons and leather legings and give us great pain untill they are
removed. my poor dog suffers with them excessively, he is constantly binting and
scratching himself as if in a rack of pain.
[Clark] JULY 26TH FRIDAY 1805
I deturmined to leave Shabono & one man who had Sore feet to rest & proceed on
with the other two to the top of a mountain 12 miles distant west from thence view
the river & vallies a head, we with great dificuelty & much fatigue reached the top at
11 oClock from the top of this mountain I could see the Course of the North fork
about 10 miles meandering through a Vallie but could discover no Indians or sign
which was fresh. I could also See Some distance up the Small River below, and also
the Middle fork. after Satisfying my Self returned to the two me[n] by an old Indian
parth, on this parth & in the Mountain we came to a Spring of excessive cold water,
which we drank reather freely of as we were almost famished; not with Standing the
precautions of wetting my face, hands, & feet I soon felt the effects of the water. We

evening.
[Lewis] SATURDAY JULY 27TH 1805.
We set out at an early hour and proceeded on but slowly the current still so rapid
that the men are in a continual state of their utmost exertion to get on, and they
begin to weaken fast from this continual state of violent exertion. at 9. A.M. at the
junction of the S.E. fork of the Missouri6 and the country opens suddonly to
extensive and beatifull plains and meadows which appear to be surrounded in every
direction with distant and lofty mountains; supposing this to be the three forks of the
Missouri I halted the party on the Lard. shore for breakfast. and walked up the S.E.
fork about 1/2 mile and ascended the point of a high limestone clift from whence I
commanded a most perfect view of the neighbouring country. from E. to S. between
the S.E. and middle forks a distant range of lofty mountains ran their snow clad tops
above the irregular and broken mountains which lie adjacent to this beautifull spot.
between the middle and S.E. forks near their junction with the S.W. fork there is a
handsome site for a fortification. after making a draught of the connection and
meanders of these streams I decended the hill and returned to the party, took
breakfast and ascended the S.W. fork 1 3/4 miles and encamped at a Lard. bend in a
handsome level smooth plain just below a bayou, having passed the entrance to the
middle fork 1/2 a mile. here I encamped to wait the return of Capt. Clark and to give
the men a little rest which seemed absolutely necessary to them. at the junc5 From Lewis's summary of Clark's report: "Here Charbono was very near
being swept away by the current and cannot swim, Capt. C. however risqued
him[self] and saved his life."

river whereas Clark traveled overland, is Clark's South Fork, the Gallatin.

Page 168
tion of the S.W. and Middle forks I found a note which had been left by Capt. Clark
informing me of his intended rout, and that he would rejoin me at this place provided
he did not fall in with any fresh sighn of Indians, in which case he intended to pursue
untill he overtook them calculating on my taking the S. W. fork, which I most
certainly prefer as it's direction is much more promising than any other.
believing this to be an essential point in the geography of this western part of the
Continent I determined to remain at all events untill I obtained the necessary data for
fixing it's latitude Longitude &c. after fixing my camp I had the canoes all unloaded
and the baggage stoed away and securely covered on shore, and then permitted
several men to hunt. I walked down to the middle fork and examined and compared
it with the S.W. fork but could not satisfy myself which was the largest stream of the
two, in fact they appeared as if they had been cast in the same mould there being no
difference in character or size, therefore to call either of these streams the Missouri
would be giving it a preference w[h]ich it's size dose not warrant as it is not larger
then the other. they are each 90 yds. wide. in these meadows I saw a number of the
duckanmalla[r]d with their young which are now nearly grown. at 3 P.M. Capt Clark
arrived very sick with a high fever on him and much fatiegued and exhausted. he
informed me that he was very sick all last night had a high fever and frequent chills &
constant aking pains in all his mustles. this morning notwithstanding his indisposition
he pursued his intended rout to the middle fork about 8 miles and finding no recent
sign of Indians rested about an hour and came down the middle fork to this place.
Capt. C. thought himself somewhat bilious and had not had a passage for several
days; I prevailed on him to take a doze of Rushes pills, which I have always found
sovereign in such cases and to bath his feet in warm water and rest himself. Capt.
C's indisposition was a further inducement for my remaining here a couple of days; I
therefore informed the men of my intention, and they put their deer skins in the
water in order to prepare them for dressing tomorrow.
we begin to feel considerable anxiety with rispect to the Snake Indians. if we do not
find them or some other nation who have horses I fear the successfull issue of our
voyage will be very doubt-

Page 169
full or at all events much more difficult in it's accomplishment. we are now several
hundred miles within the bosom of this wild and mountanous country, where game
may rationally be expected shortly to become scarce and subsistence precarious
without any information with rispect to the country not knowing how far these
mountains continue, or wher to direct our course to pass them to advantage or
intersept a navigable branch of the Columbia, or even were we on such an one the
probability is that we should not find any timber within these mountains large enough
for canoes if we judge from the portion of them through which we have passed.
however I still hope for the best, and intend taking a tramp myself in a few days to
find these yellow gentlemen if possible. my two principal consolations are that from
our present position it is impossible that the S.W. fork can head with the waters of
any other river but the Columbia, and that if any Indians can subsist in the form of a
nation in these mountains with the means they have of acquiring food we can also
subsist.

From the Three Forks of the Missouri to Beaver's Head
[Lewis] SUNDAY JULY 28TH 1805.
Both Capt. C. and myself corrisponded in opinion with rispect to the impropriety of
calling either of these streams the Missouri and accordingly agreed to name them
after the President of the United States and the Secretaries of the Treasury and state
having previously named one river in honour of the Secretaries of War and Navy. In
pursuance of this resolution we called the S.W. fork, that which we meant to ascend,
Jefferson's River in honor of that illustrious personage Thomas Jefferson. [the author
of our enterprize.] the Middle fork we called Madison's River in honor of James
Madison, and the S.E. Fork we called Gallitin's River in honor of Albert Gallitin
[Gallatin]. the two first are 90 yards wide and the last is 70 yards. all of them run
with great volocity and th[r]ow out large bodies of water. Gallitin's River is reather
more rapid than either of the others, is not quite as deep but from all appearances
may be navigated to a considerable distance. Capt. C. who came down Madison's
river yesterday and has also seen Jefferson's some distance thinks Madison's reather
the most rapid, but it is not as much so by any means as Gallitin's. the beds of all
these streams are formed of smooth pebble and gravel, and their waters perfectly
transparent; in short they are three noble streams. there is timber enough here to
support an establishment, provided it be erected with brick or stone either of which
would be much cheaper than wood as all the materials for such a work are
immediately at the spot. there are several small sand-bars along the shores at no
great distance of very pure sand

Page 171
and the earth appears as if it would make good brick. I had all our baggage spread
out to dry this morning; and the day proving warm, I had a small bower or booth
erected for the comfort of Capt. C. our leather lodge when exposed to the sun is
excessively hot. all those who are not hunting altho' much fatiegued are busily
engaged in dressing their skins, making mockersons lexing [leggings] &c to make
themselves comfortable. the Musquetoes are more than usually troublesome, the
knats are not as much so. in the evening about 4 O'Ck the wind blew hard from
South West and after some little time brought on a Cloud attended with thunder and
Lightning from which we had a fine refreshing shower which cooled the air
considerably; the showers continued with short intervals untill after dark. in the
evening the hunters all returned they had killed 8 deer and 2 Elk, some of the deer
wer in excellent order.
Our present camp is precisely on the spot that the Snake Indians were encamped at
the time the Minnetares of the Knife R. first came in sight of them five years since.
from hence they retreated about three miles up Jeffersons river and concealed
themselves in the woods, the Minnetares pursued, attacked them, killed 4 men 4
women a number of boys, and mad[e] prisoners of all the females and four boys,
Sah-cah-gar-we-ah o[u]r Indian woman was one of the female prisoners taken at
that time; tho' I cannot discover that she shews any immotion of sorrow in
recollecting this event, or of joy in being restored to her native country; if she has
enough to eat and a few trinkets to wear I believe she would be perfectly content
anywhere.1
TUESDAY JULY 30TH 1805.
Capt. Clark being much better this morning and having completed my observations
we reloaded our canoes and set out, ascending Jeffersons river. Sharbono, his
woman two invalleds and myself walked through the bottom on the Lard. side of the
river about 4 1/2 miles when we again struck it at the place the woman informed us
that she was taken prisoner. here we halted untill
1 Ordway: "She tells us that she was taken in the middle of the River as she
was crossing at a Shole place to make hir ascape."

Page 172
Capt. Clark arrived which was not untill after one P. M. the water being strong and
the river extreemly crooked. we dined and again proceeded on; as the river now
passed through the woods the invalleds got on board together with Sharbono and
the Indian woman; I passed the river and continued my walk on the Stard. side. saw
a vast number of beaver in many large dams which they had maid. I directed my
course to the high plain to the right which I gained after some time with much
difficulty and waiding many beaver dams to my waist in mud and water. I would
willingly have joined the canoes but the brush were so thick, the river crooked and
bottoms intercepted in such manner by the beaver dams, that I found it uceless to
attempt to find them, and therefore proceeded on up the river in order to intersept it
where it came near the plain and would be more collected into one channel.
at length about sunset I arrived at the river only about six miles from my calculation
on a direct line from the place I had left the canoes but I thought they were still
below me. I found the river was divided where I reached it by an Island and was
therefore fearfull that they might pass without my seeing them, and went down to
the lower point of the large island; here I discovered a small Island, close under the
shore on which I was; I passed the narrow channel to the small island and examined
the gravly bar along the edge of the river for the tracks of the men, knowing from
the appearance of the river at this place that if they had passed they would have
used the cord on the side where I was. I saw no tracks and was then fully convinced
that they were below me. I fired my gun and hallooed but counld hear nothing of
them. by this time it was getting nearly dark and a duck lit on the shore in about 40
steps of me and I killed it; having now secured my supper I looked our for a suitable
place to amuse myself in combating the musquetos for the ballance of the evening. I
found a parsel of drift wood at the head of the little Island on which I was and
immediately set it on fire and collected some willow brush to lye on. I cooked my
duck which I found very good and after eating it layed down and should have had a
comfortable nights lodge but for the musquetoes which infested me all night. late at
night I was awakened by the nois of some animal runing over the stoney bar on
which I lay but did not see it; from the weight with which it ran I supposed it to be
either an Elk or a brown bear.

Page 173
WEDNESDAY JULY 31ST 1805.
This morning I waited at my camp very impatiently for the arrival of Capt. Clark and
party; I observed by my watch t[h]at it was 7 A. M. and they had not come in sight.
I now became very uneasy and determined to wait until 8 and if they did not arrive
by that time to proceed on up the river taking it as a fact that they had passed my
camp some miles last evening. just as I set out to pursue my plan I discovered
Charbono walking up shore some distance below me and waited untill [he] arrived I
now learnt that the canoes were behind, they arrived shortly after. their detention
had been caused by the rapidity of the water and the circuitous rout of the river. they
halted and breakfasted after which we all set out again and I continued my walk on
the Stard. shore the river now becomes more collected the islands tho' numerous ar
generally small. the river continues rapid and is from 90 to 120 yds. wide has a
considerable quantity of timber in it's bottoms. towards evening the bottoms became
much narrower and the timber much more scant.
this evening just before we encamped Drewyer discovered a brown bear enter a
small cops of bushes on the Lard. side; we surrounded the place and surched the
brush but he had escaped in some manner unperceived but how we could not
discover. nothing killed today and our fresh meat is out. when we have a plenty of
fresh meat I find it impossible to make the men take any care of it, or use it with the
least frugallity. tho' I expect that necessity will shortly teach them this art. the
mountiains on both sides of the river at no great distance are very lofty.
We have a lame crew just now, two with tumers or bad boils on various parts of
them, one with a bad stone bruise, one with his arm accedently dislocated but
fortunately well replaced, and a fifth has streigned his back by slipping and falling
backwards on the gun-wall of the canoe. the latter is Sergt. Gass. it gives him great
pain to work in the canoe in his present situation, but he thinks he can walk with
convenience, I therefore selected him as one of the party to accompany me
to-morrow, being determined to go in quest of the Snake Indians. I also directed
Drewyer and Charbono to hold themselves in readiness. Charbono thinks that his
ankle is sufficiently recovered to stand the march but I entertain my doubts

Page 174
of the fact; he is very anxious to accompany me and I therefore indulge him.
AUGUST 1ST 1805
At half after 8 A. M. we halted for breakfast and as had been previously agreed on
between Capt. Clark and myself I set out with 3 men in quest of the Snake Indians.
the men I took were the two Interpreters Drewyer and Sharbono and Sergt. Gass.
the rout we took lay over a rough high range of mountains on the North side of the
river. the rive[r] entered these mountains a few miles above where we left it.2 Capt.
Clark recommended this rout to me from a belief that the river as soon as it past the
mountains boar to the N. of W. he having a few days before asscended these
mountains to a position from which he discovered a large valley passing between the
mountains and which boar to the N. West. this however p[r]oved to be the inlet of a
large creek which discharged itself into the river just above this range of mountains,
the river bearing to the S. W. we were therefore thrown several miles out of our
rout. as soon as we discovered our mistake we directed our course to the river
which we at length gained about 2 P. M. much exhausted by the heat of the day the
roughness of the road and the want of water.
the mountains are extreemly bare of timber and our rout lay through the steep
valleys exposed to the heat of the sun without shade and scarcely a breath of air;
and to add to my fatiegue in this walk of about 11 miles I had taken a doze of
glauber salts in the morning in consequence of a slight desentary with which I had
been afflicted for several days; being weakened by the disorder and the opperation
of the medecine I found myself almost exhausted before we reached the river. I felt
my sperits much revived on our near approach to the river at the sight of a herd of
Elk of which Drewyer and myself killed two. we then hurried to the river and allayed
our thirst. I ordered two of the men to skin the Elk and bring the meat to the river
while myself and the other prepared a fire and cooked some of the meat for our
dinner. we made a comfortable meal of the Elk and left the ballance of the meat on
the bank of the river [for] the party with Capt. Clark. this supply was
2 The Tobacco Root Range.

Page 175
no doubt very acceptable to them as they had had no fresh meat for near two days
except one beaver Game being very scarce and shy. we had seen a few deer and
some goats but had not been fortunate enough to kill any of them. after dinner we
resumed our march and encamped about 6 M. above on the Stard side of the river.
Shortly after I left Capt. Clark this morning he proceed on and passed through the
mountains; they formed tremendious clifts of ragged and nearly perpendicular rocks;
the lower part of this rock is of the black grannite before mentioned and the upper
part a light coloured freestone. these clifts continue for 9 miles and approach the
river very closely on either side. he found the current verry strong. Capt. C. killed a
big horn on these clifts which himself and party dined on. after passing this range of
mountains he entered this beautifull valley in which we also were just at the upper
side of the mountain there is a bad rappid here the toe line of our canoe broke in the
shoot of the rapids and swung on the rocks and had very nearly overset.
FRIDAY AUGUST 2ED 1805.
We resumed our march this morning at sunrise. finding that the river still boar to the
South I determined to pass it if possible in order to shorten our rout; this we effected
by wading the river about 5 miles above our encampment of the last evening. we
found the current very rapid waist deep and about 90 yds. wide. bottom smooth
pebble with a small mixture of coarse gravel. this is the first time I ever dared to
wade the river, tho' there are many places between this and the forks where I
presume it might be attempted with equal success. The valley along which we
passed today, and through which the river winds it's meandering course is from 6 to
8 miles wide and consists of a bea[u]tifull level plain with but little timber and that
confined to the verge of the river; the land is tolerably fertile, and is either black or
dark yellow loam, covered with grass from 9 inches to 2 feet high. the plain ascends
gradually on either side of the river to the bases of two ranges of high mountains.
the tops of these mountains are yet covered partially with snow, while we in the
valley are nearly suffocated with the intense heat of the mid-day sun; the nights are
so cold that two blankets are not more than sufficient covering.

Page 176
soon after passing the river this morning Sergt. Gass lost my tommahawk in the
thick brush and we were unable to find it, I regret the loss of this usefull implement,
however accedents will happen in the best families, and I consoled myself with the
recollection that it was not the only one we had with us. the bones of the buffaloe
and their excrement of an old date are to be met with in every part of this valley but
we have long since lost all hope of meeting with that animal in these mountains. no
recent appearance of Indians. the Indians in this part of the country appear to
construct their lodges with the willow boughs and brush; they are small of a conic
figure and have a small aperture on one side through which they enter. we continued
out rout up this valley on the Lard. side of the river until sunset, at which time we
encamped on the Lard. bank of the river having traveled 24 miles. we had brought
with us a good stock of venison of which we eat a hearty supper. I feel myself
perfectly recovered of my indisposition, and do not doubt being able to pursue my
rout tomorrow with the same comfort I have done today.
Capt. Clark continued his rout early this morning. the rapidity of the current was
such that his progress was slow, in short it required the utmost exertion of the men
to get on, nor could they resist this current by any other means than that of the cord
and pole. in the course of the day they passed some villages of burrowing squirrels,
saw a number of beaver dams and the inhabitants of them, many young ducks both
of the Duckanmallard and the redheaded fishing duck, gees, several rattle snakes,
black woodpeckers, and a large gang of Elk; they found the river much crouded with
island both large and small and passed a small creek on Stard. side which we called
birth Creek.3 Capt. Clark discovers a tumor rising on the inner side of his ankle this
evening which was painfull to him. they incamped in a level bottom on the Lard. side.
SATURDAY AUGUST 3RD 1805.
Set out early this morning, or before sunrise; still continued our march through the
level valley on the lard. side of the river. the valley much as yesterday only reather
wider; I think it 12 Miles wide, tho' the plains near the mountains rise higher and are
more broken with some scattering pine near the mountain. in the
3 Named thus for Clark's birthday (August 1).

Page 177
leaveler parts of the plain and river bottoms which are very extensive there is no
timber except a scant proportion of cottonwood near the river. the Mountains
continue high on either side of the valley, and are but scantily supplyed with timber;
small pine appears to be the prevalent growth; it is of the pich kind, with a short leaf.
at 11 A.M. Drewyer killed a doe and we halted about 2 hours and breakfasted, and
then continued our rout until night without halting, when we arrived at the river in a
level bottom which appeared to spread to greater extent than usual. from the
appearance of the timber I supposed that the river forked above us and resolved to
examine this part of the river minutely tomorrow. this evening we passed through a
high plain for about 8 miles covered with prickly pears and bearded grass, tho' we
found this even better walking than the wide bottoms of the river, which we passed
in the evening. we encamped on the river bank on Lard. side having traveled by
estimate 23 Miles.
Capt. Clark set out this morning as usual. he walked on shore a small distance this
morning and killed a deer. in the course of his walk he saw a track which he
supposed to be that of an Indian from the curcumstance of the large toes turning
inward, he pursued the track and found that the person had ascended a point of a
hill from which his camp of the last evening was visible; this circumstance also
confirmed the beleif of it's being an Indian who had thus discovered them and ran
off. they found the river as usual much crouded with islands, the currant more rapid
& much more shallow than usual. in many places they were obliged to double man
the canoes and drag them over the stone and gravel. this morning they passed a
small creek on Stard. at the entrance of which Reubin Fields killed a large Panther.
we called the creek after that animal Panther Creek.4 they also passed a handsome
little stream on Lard. which is form of several large springs which rise in the bottoms
and along the base of the mountains with some little rivulets from the melting snows.
in the evening they passed a very bad rappid where the bed of the river is formed
entrely of solid rock and encamped on an island just above. the men wer
4 Pipestone Creek. Here the expedition passes the last means of access to the
better of the two routes which the Minnetarees had recommended (see p. 88).
By Pipestone Pass they could have reached Deer Lodge Prairie and then could
have gone down the Silverbow and Deer Lodge Rivers names given to different
stretches of the same stream to the Hellgate River and on to Bitterroot Valley.

Page 178
compelled to be a great proportion of their time in the water today; they have had a
severe days labour and are much fortiegued.
By now the Jefferson is in transition, a plains river becoming a mountain river and
as Lewis says: ''the river continued to be crouded with Islands, rapid and shoaly.
these shoals or riffles succeeded each other every 3 or four hundred yards; at those
places they are obliged to drag the canoes over the stone there not being water
enough to float them, and between the riffles the current is so strong that they are
compelled to have c[r]ecourse to the cord; and being unable to walk on the shore
for the brush wade in the river along the shore and hawl them by the cord; this has
increased the pain and labour extreemly; their feet soon get tender and soar by
wading and walking over the stones. these are also so slipry that they frequently get
severe falls. being constantly wet soon makes them feble also.''
The party reaches what Lewis describes as the forks of the Jefferson, although the
two smaller streams that enter the main one hardly deserve that term. The northerly
one, which Lewis personally names Wisdom River, is the Big Hole. The other,
Lewis's Philanthropy, is the Ruby of today's maps but the Stinkingwater on earlier
ones. Lewis continues to speak of the central fork as the Jefferson, but today the
Jefferson ends here and this fork is called the Beaverhead. The labor of pulling the
boats up such unnavigable streams steadily increases. "The men were so much
fortiegued today that they wished much that navigation was at an end that they
might go by land." Clark's infected ankle continues to cripple him. Charbonneau
remains lame. Drewyer is almost disabled by a fall.
Lewis and his small party continued to scout ahead of the boats. But they have seen
no Indians.
[Lewis] TUESDAY AUGUST 6TH 1805.
about five miles above the forks I hea[r]d the hooping of the party to my left and
changed my rout towards them; on my arrival found that they had taken the rapid
fork and learnt from Capt. Clark that he had not found the note which I had left for
him at that place and the reasons which had induced him to ascend this

Page 179
stream. it was easeist & more in our direction, and apd. to contain as much water.
he had however previously to my comeing up with him, met Drewyer who informed
him of the state of the two rivers and was on his return. one of their canoes had just
overset and all the baggage wet, the medecine box among other articles and several
articles lost a shot pouch and horn with all the implements for one rifle lost and
never recovered.
I walked down to the point where I waited their return. on their arrival found that
two other canoes had filled with water and wet their cargoes completely. Whitehouse
had been thrown out of one of these canoes as she swing in a rapid current and the
canoe had rubed him and pressed him to the bottom as she passed over him and
had the water been inches shallower must inevitably have crushed him to death. our
parched meal, corn, Indian preasents, and a great part of our most valuable stores
were wet and much damaged on this ocasion. to examine, dry and arrange our
stores was the first object; we therefore passed over to the lard. side opposite to the
entrance of the rapid fork where there was a large gravly bar that answered our
purposes; wood was also convenient and plenty. here we fixed our camp, and
unloaded all our canoes and opened and exposed to dry such articles as had been
wet. a part of the load of each canoe consisted of the leaden canestirs of powder
which were not in least injured, tho' some of them had remained upwards of an hour
under water. about 20 lbs. of powder which we had in a tight Keg or at l[e]ast one
which we thought sufficiently so got wet and intirely spoiled. this would have been
the case with the other had it not have been for the expedient which I had fallen on
of securing the powder by means of the lead having the latter formed into canesters
which were filled with the necessary proportion of po[w]der to discharge the lead
when used, and those canesters well secured with corks and wax. in this country the
air is so pure and dry that any vessel however well seasoned the timber may be will
give way or shrink unless it is kept full of some liquid. we found that three deer skins
which we had left at a considerable hight on a tree were taken off which we
supposed had been done by a panther. we sent out some men to hunt this evening
they killed 3 deer and four Elk which gave us a plentifull supply om [of] meat once
more.
Shannon had been dispatched up the rapid fork this morning to hunt, by Capt Clark
before he met with Drewyer or learnt his

Page 180
mistake in the rivers. when he returned he sent Drewyer in surch of him, but he
rejoined us this evening and reported that he had been several miles up the river and
could find nothing of him. we had the trumpet sounded and fired several guns but he
did not join us this evening. I am fearful he is lost again. this is the same man who
was seperated from us 15 days as we came up the Missouri and subsisted 9 days of
that time on grapes only. Whitehouse is in much pain this evening with the injury
one of his legs sustained from the canoe today at the time it upset and swing over
him. Capt Clarks ankle is also very painfull to him. we should have given the party a
days rest some where near this place had not this accedent happened, as I had
determined to take some observations to fix the Latitude and longitude of these
forks. our merchandize medecine &c are not sufficiently dry this evening we covered
them securely for the evening.
we believe that the N.W. or rapid fork is the dane [drain] of the melting snows of the
mountains, and that it is not as long as the middle fork and dose not at all seasons of
the year supply any thing like as much water as the other and that about this season
it rises to it's greatest hight. this last appears from the apparent bed of the river
which is now overflown and the water in many plases spreads through old channels
which have their bottoms covered with grass that has grown this season and is such
as appears on the parts of the bottom not innundated. we therefore determined that
the middle fork was that which ought of right to bear the name we had given to the
lower portion or River Jefferson, and called the bold rapid an[d] clear stream
Wisdom, and the more mild and placid one which flows in from the S.E.
Philanthrophy, in commemoration of two of those cardinal virtues, which have so
eminently marked that deservedly selibrated character through life.
WEDNESDAY AUGUST 7TH 1805
Dispatched Reubin Fields in surch of Shannon. Our stores were now so much
exhausted that we found we could proceed with one canoe less, we therefore drew
out one of them into a thicket of brush and secured her in such manner that the
water could not take her off should the river rise to the hight where she is. my air
gun was out of order and her sights had been removed by some ac-

Page 181
cedent I put her in order and regulated her. she shot again as well as she ever did.
At one oclock all our baggage was dry we therefore packed it up reloaded the canoes
and the party proceeded with Capt. Clark up Jefferson's river. I remained with Sergt.
Gass to complete the observation of equal altitudes and joined them in the evening
at their camp on the Lard. side. we had a shower of rain wich continued about 40
minutes attended with thunder and lightning. this shower wet me perfectly before I
reached the camp. the clouds continued during the night in such manner that I was
unable to obtain any lunar observations. This evening Drewyer brought in a deer
which he had killed. we have not heard any thing from Shannon yet, we expect that
he has pursued Wisdom river upwards for som distance probably killed some heavy
animal and is waiting our arrival.
THURSDAY AUGUST 8TH 1805.
at Noon Reubin Fields arrived and reported that he had been up Wisdom river some
miles above where it entered the mountain and could find nothing of Shannon, he
had killed a deer and an Antelope. great quantity of beaver Otter and musk-rats in
these rivers. two of the hunters we sent out this morning returned at noon had killed
each a deer and an Antelope. we use the seting poles today almost altogether. we
encamped on the Lard side where there was but little timber were obliged to use
willow brush for fuel; the rosebushes and bryers were very thick. the hunters
brought in another deer this evening. t[h]e tumor on Capt. Clarks ankle has
discharged a considerable quantity of matter but is still much swolen and inflamed
and gives him considerable pain. saw a number of Gees ducks and some Crains
today. the former begin to fly. the evening again proved cloudy much to my
mortification and prevented my making any lunar observations.
the Indian woman recognized the point of a high plain to our right which she
informed us was not very distant from the summer retreat of her nation on a river
beyond the mountains which runs to the west. this hill she says her nation calls the
beaver's head from a conceived re[se]mblance of it's figure to the head of that
animal. she assures us that we shall either find her people on this river or on the
river immediately west of it's source; which from it's present size cannot be distant.
as it is now all important with us

Page 182
to meet with those people as soon as possible I determined to proceed tomorrow
with a small party to the source of the principal stream of this river and pass the
mountains to the Columbia; and down that river untill I found the Indians; in short it
is my resolusion to find them or some others, who have horses if it should cause me
a trip of one month. for without horses we shall be obliged to leave a great part of
our stores, of which, it appears to me that we have a stock already sufficiently small
for the length of the voyage before us.
Sacajawea has recognized a landmark which tells her that they are not far from the
place where her people are accustomed to cross the Bitterroot Mountains (whose
crest is here the Continental Divide) to westward-flowing waters. That place is
Lemhi Pass. The camp where Lewis makes his decision to go through the Pass in
search of the Shoshones is six land miles, fourteen miles by the river, up the
Beaverhead from the mouth of the Ruby River, or about twenty miles north of Dillon,
Montana.
[Clark] AUGUST 9TH FRIDAY 1805
a fine morning wind from the N.E. we proceeded on verry well rapid places more
noumerous than below, Shannon the man whome we lost on Wisdom River Joined
us, haveing returned to the forks & prosued us up after prosueing Wisdom River one
day.
Capt Lewis and 3 men5 Set out after brackft. to examine the river above, find a
portage if possible, also the Snake Indians. I Should have taken this trip had I have
been able to march, from the rageing fury of a tumer on my anckle musle, in the
evening Clouded up and a fiew drops of rain Encamped on the Lard Side near a low
bluff, the river to day as yesterday, the three hunters Could kill only two antelopes to

[Lewis] SATURDAY AUGUST 10TH 1805.
after passing a large creek at about 5 miles we fel in with a plain Indian road which
led towards the point that the river entered the
5 Drewyer, Shields, and McNeal.

Page 183
mountain we therefore pursued the road I sent Drewyer to the wright to kill a deer
which we saw feeding and halted on the river under an immencely high perpendicular
clift of rocks where it entered the mountain here we kindled a fire and waited for
Drewyer. he arrived in about an hour and a half or at noon with three deer skins and
the flesh of one of the best of them; we cooked and eat a haisty meal and departed,
returning a sho[r]t distance to the Indian road which led us the best way over the
mountains, which are not very high but ar ruggid and approach the river closely on
both sides from the number of rattle snakes about the Clifts at which we halted we
called them the rattle snake clifts.
the river below the mountains is rapid rocky, very crooked, much divided by islands
and withal shallow. after it enters the mountain it's bends are not so circuetous and
it's general course more direct, but it is equally shallow les[s] divided more rocky
and rapid. we continued our rout along the Indian road which led us sometimes over
the hills and again in the narrow bottoms of the river till at the distance of fifteen Ms.
from the rattle snake Clifts we arrived in a ha[n]dsome open and leavel vally where
the river divided itself nearly into two equal branches; here I halted and examined
those streams and readily discovered from their size that it would be vain to attempt
the navigation of either any further.6 here also the road forked one leading up the
vally of each of these streams. I therefore sent Drewyer on one and Shields on the
other to examine these roads for a short distance and to return and compare their
information with respect to the size and apparent plainness of the roads as I was
now determined to pursue that which appeared to have been the most traveled this
spring. in the mean
6 Lewis reaches this momentous decision where Prairie Creek comes down
from the mountains and enters what is now called Red Rock Creek for in
contemporary usage the Beaverhead ends at Dillon, where it forks into Red
Rock Creek to the west and Blacktail Deer Creek to the east. This is Lewis's
"Forks of the Jefferson" (Coues's "Two Forks of the Jefferson") and by this
decision he makes it the head of navigation. The boats will be sunk in a
near-by pond. Shoshone Cove, which is to be the home camp till August 30, is
a high circular valley reached some five miles up Prairie Creek.
Red Rock Creek flows to this junction from the southeast, from Upper Red Rock
Lake, near the foot of Red Rock Pass, due west of Yellowstone Park. The lake is
near the Continental Divide, which here runs east and west and forms the
Montana-Idaho boundary. It is considered the ultimate source of the Missouri
River, 2714 miles from the junction of the Missouri and the Mississippi. On the
Idaho side of the Divide is Henry Lake, the source of Henry's Fork of the Snake
(Lewis's) River.

Page 184
time I wrote a note to Capt. Clark informing him of the occurrences which had taken
place, recommending it to him to halt at this place until my return and enforming him
of the rout I had taken which from the information of the men on their return seemed
to be in favour of the S W or Left hand fork which is reather the smallest.
accordingly I put up my note on a dry willow pole at the forks, and set out up the
S.E. fork, after proceeding about 1 1/2 miles I discovered that the road became so
blind that it could not be that which we had followed to the forks of Jefferson's river;
neither could I find the tracks of the horses which had passed early in the spring
along the other; I therefore determined to return and examine the other myself,
which I did, and found that the same horses had passed up the West fork which was
reather [the] largest, and more in the direction that I wished to pursue; I therefore
did not hesitate about changing my rout but determined to take the western road. I
now wrote a second note to Capt C. informing him of this change and sent Drewyer
to put it with the other at the forks and waited untill he returned. there is scarcely
any timber on the river above the Rt. Snake Clifts, nor is there anything larger than
willow brush in sight of these forks. immediately in the level plain between the forks
and about 1/2 a mile distance from them stands a high rocky mountain, the base of
which is surrounded by the level plain; it has a singular appearance. the mountains
do not appear very high in any direction tho' the tops of some of them are partially
covered with snow. this convinces me that we have ascended to a great hight since
we have entered the rocky Mountains, yet the ascent has been so gradual along the
vallies that it was scarcely perceptable by land. I do not beleive that the world can
furnish an example of a river runing to the extent which the Missouri and Jefferson's
rivers do through such a mountainous country and at the same time so navigable as
they are. if the Columbia furnishes us such another example, a communication
across the continent by water will be practicable and safe. but this I can scarcely
hope from a knowledge of its having in it[s] comparitively short course to the ocean
the same number of feet to decend which the Missouri and Mississippi have from this
point to the Gulph of Mexico.

Chapter XIV
From Beaver's Head to the Great Divide
[Lewis] SUNDAY AUGUST 11TH 1805.
The track which we had pursued last evening soon disappeared. I therefore resolved
to proceed to the narrow pass on the creek about 10 miles West in hopes that I
should again find the Indian road at the place, accordingly I proceeded through the
level plain directly to the pass. I now sent Drewyer to keep near the creek to my
right and Shields to my left, with orders to surch for the road which if they found
they were to notify me by placing a hat in the muzzle of their gun. I kept McNeal with
me; after having marched in this order for about five miles I discovered an Indian on
horse back about two miles distant coming down the plain towards us. with my glass
I discovered from his dress that he was of a different nation from any that we had
yet seen, and was satisfyed of his being a Sosone; his arms were a bow and quiver
of arrows, and was mounted on an eligant horse without a saddle, and a small string
which was attatched to the under jaw of the horse which answered as a bridle.
I was overjoyed at the sight of this stranger and had no doubt of obtaining a friendly
introduction to his nation provided I could get near enough to him to convince him of
our being whitemen. I therefore proceeded towards him at my usual pace. when I
had arrived within about a mile he mad[e] a halt which I did also and unloosing my
blanket from my pack, I mad[e] him the signal of friendship known to the Indians of
the Rocky mountains and those of the Missouri, which is by holding the mantle or
robe in your hands at two corners and then th[r]owing [it] up in the air higher than
the head bringing it to the earth as if in the act of spreading

Page 186
it, thus repeating three times. this signal of the robe has arrisen from a custom
among all those nations of spreading a robe or skin for ther gests to set on when
they are visited. this signal had not the desired effect, he still kept his position and
seemed to view Drewyer an[d] Shields who were now comiming in sight on either
hand with an air of suspicion, I wo[u]ld willingly have made them halt but they were
too far distant to hear me and I feared to make any signal to them least it should
increase the suspicion in the mind of the Indian of our having some unfriendly design
upon him. I therefore haistened to take out of my sack some b[e]ads a looking glas
and a few trinkets which I had brought with me for this purpose and leaving my gun
and pouch with McNeal advanced unarmed towards him. he remained in the same
stedfast poisture until I arrived in about 200 paces of him when he turn[ed] his
ho[r]se about and began to move off slowly from me; I now called to him in as loud
a voice as I could command repeating the word tab-ba-bone, which in their language
signifyes white-man. but lo[o]king over his sholder he still kept his eye on Drewyer
and Sheilds who wer still advancing neither of them haveing segacity enough to
recollect the impropriety of advancing when they saw me thus in parley with the
Indian.
I now made a signal to these men to halt, Drewyer obeyed but Shields who
afterwards told me that he did not obse[r]ve the signal still kept on the Indian halted
again and turned his ho[r]se about as if to wait for me, and I beleive he would have
remained untill I came up with him had it not been for Shields who still pressed
forward. whe[n] I arrived within about 150 paces I again repepeated the word
tab-ba-bone and held up the trinkits in my hands and striped up my shirt sleve to
give him an opportunity of seeing the colour of my skin and advanced leasure[ly]
towards him but he did not remain until I got nearer than about 100 paces when he
suddonly turned his ho[r]se about, gave him the whip leaped the creek and
disapeared in the willow brush in an instant and with him vanished all my hopes of
obtaining horses for the present. I now felt quite as much mortification and
disappointment as I had pleasure and expectation at the first sight of this indian. I
fe[l]t soarly chargrined at the conduct of the men particularly Sheilds to whom I
principally attributed this failure in obtaining an introduction to the natives.
we now set out on the track of the horse hoping by that means to

Page 187
be lead to an indian camp, the trial of inhabitants of which should they abscond we
should probably be enabled to pursue to the body of the nation to which they would
most probably fly for safety. this rout led us across a large Island framed by nearly
an equal division of the creek in this bottom; after passing to the open ground on the
N. side of the creek we observed that the track made out toward the high hills about
3 M. distant in that direction. I thought it probable that their camp might probably be
among those hills & that they would reconnoiter us from the tops of them, and that if
we advanced haistily towards them that they would become allarmed and probably
run off; I therefore halted in an elivated situation near the creek had a fire kindled of
willow brush cooked and took breakfast. during this leasure I prepared a small
assortment of trinkits consisting of some mockkerson awls a few strans of several
kinds of b[e]ads some paint a looking glass &c which I attatched to the end of a pole
and planted it near our fire in order that should the Indians return in surch of us
the[y] might from this token discover that we were friendly and white persons.
before we had finis[h]ed our meal a heavy shower of rain came on with some hail
which continued abo[u]t 20 minutes and wet us to the skin, after this shower we
pursued the track of the horse but as the rain had raised the grass which he had
trodden down it was with difficulty that we could follow it. we pursued it however
about 4 miles it turning up the valley to the left under the foot of the hills. we pas
several places where the Indians appeared to have been diging roots today and saw
the fresh tracks of 8 or ten horses but they had been wandering about in such a
confused manner that we not only lost the track of the hose which we had been
pursuing but could make nothing of them. in the head of this valley we passed a
large bog covered with tall grass and moss in which were a great number of springs
of cold pure water, we now turned a little to the left along the foot of the high hills
and arrived at a small branch on which we encamped for the night, after meeting
with the Indian today I fixed a small flag of the U'.S. to a pole which I made McNeal
carry. and planted in the ground where we halted or encamped.
MONDAY AUGUST 12TH 1805.
This morning I sent Drewyer out as soon as it was light, to try and discover what
rout the Indians had taken. he followed the

Page 188
track of the horse we had pursued yesterday to the mountain wher it had ascended,
and returned to me in about an hour and a half. I now determined to pursue the
base of the mountains which form this cove to the S.W. in the expectation of finding
some Indian road which lead over the Mountains, accordingly I sent Drewyer to my
right and Shields to my left with orders to look out for a road or the fresh tracks of
horses either of which we should first meet with I had determined to pursue. at the
distance of about 4 miles we passed 4 small rivulets near each other on which we
saw som resent bowers or small conic lodges formed with willow brush. near them
the indians had geathered a number of roots from the manner in which they had
toarn up the ground; but I could not discover the root which they seemed to be in
surch of.
near this place we fell in with a large and plain Indian road which came into the cove
from the N.E. and led along the foot of the mountains to the S.W. o[b]liquely
approaching the main stream which we had left yesterday. this road we now pursued
to the S.W. at 5 miles it passed a stout stream which is a principal fork of the ma[i]n
stream and falls into it just above the narrow pass between the two clifts before
mentioned and which we now saw below us. here we halted and breakfasted on the
last of our venison, having yet a small peice of pork in reserve. after eating we
continued our rout through the low bottom of the main stream along the foot of the
mountains on our right the valley for 5 Mls. further in a S.W. direction was from 2 to
3 miles wide the main stream now after discarding two stream[s] on the left in this
valley turns abruptly to the West through a narrow bottom betwe[e]n the mountains.
the road was still plain, I therefore did not dispair of shortly finding a passage over
the mountains and of taisting the waters of the great Columbia this evening.
at the distance of 4 miles further the road took us to the most distant fountain of the
waters of the Mighty Missouri in surch of which we have spent so many toilsome
days and wristless nights. thus far I had accomplished one of those great objects on
which my mind has been unalterably fixed for many years, judge then of the
pleasure I felt in all[a]ying my thirst with this pure and icecold water which issues
from the base of a low mountain or hill of a gentle ascent for 1\2 a mile. the
mountains are high on either hand leave this gap at the head of this rivulet through
which the road passes. here I halted a few minutes and rested myself. two

Page 189
miles below McNeal had exultingly stood with a foot on each side of this little rivulet
and thanked his god that he had lived to bestride the mighty & heretofore deemed
endless Missouri. after refreshing ourselves we proceeded on to the top of the
dividing ridge from which I discovered immence ranges of high mountains still to the
West of us with their tops partially covered with snow. I now decended the mountain
about 3\4 of a mile which I found much steeper than on the opposite side, to a
handsome bold runing Creek of cold Clear water. here I first tasted the water of the
great Columbia river.1 after a short halt of a few minutes we continued our march
along the Indian road which lead us over steep hills and deep hollows to a spring on
the side of a mountain where we found a sufficient quantity of dry willow brush for
fuel, here we encamped for the night having traveled about 20 Miles. as we had killed
nothing during the day we now boiled and eat the remainder of our pork, having yet
a little flour and parched meal.
this morning Capt. Clark set out early. found the river shoally, rapid, shallow, and
extreemly difficult. the men in the water almost all day. they are geting weak soar
and much fortiegued; they complained of the fortiegue to which the navigation
subjected them and wished to go by land Capt. C. engouraged them and passifyed
them.
TUESDAY AUGUST 13TH 1805.
at the distance of five miles the road after leading us down a long decending valley
for 2 Ms. brought us to a large cheek about 10 yds. wide; this we passed and on
rising the hill beyond it had a view of a handsome little valley to our left of about a
mile in width through which from the appearance of the timber I conjectured that a
river passed. we had proceeded about four miles through a wavy plain parallel to the
valley or river bottom when at the distance of about a mile we saw two women, a
man and some dogs on an eminence immediately before us. they appeared to v[i]ew
us with attention and two of them after a few minutes set down as if to wait our
arrival we continued our usual pace to1 Lewis has crossed the Continental Divide by way of Lemhi Pass, due west of
Armstead, Montana. The rivulet from which he drinks is one of the headwater
streams of the small Lemhi River.

Page 190
wards them. when we had arrived within half a mile of them I directed the party to
halt and leaving my pack and rifle I took the flag which I unfurled and a[d]vanced
singly towards them the women soon disappeared behind the hill, the man continued
untill I arrived within a hundred yards of him and then likewise absconded. tho' I
frequently repeated the word tab-ba-bone sufficiently loud for him to have heard it.
I now haistened to the top of the hill where they had stood but could see nothing of
them. the dogs were less shye than their masters they came about me pretty close I
therefore thought of tying a handkerchief about one of their necks with some beads
and other trinkets and then let them loose to surch their fugitive owners thinking by
this means to convince them of our pacific disposition towards them but the dogs
would not suffer me to take hold of them; they also soon disappeared. I now made a
signal fror the men to come on, they joined me and we pursued the the back track of
these Indians which lead us along the same road which we had been traveling. the
road was dusty and appeared to have been much traveled lately both by men and
horses.
we had not continued our rout more than a mile when we were so fortunate as to
meet with three female savages. the short and steep ravines which we passed
concealed us from each other untill we arrived within 30 paces. a young woman
immediately took to flight, an Elderly woman and a girl of about 12 years old
remained. I instantly laid by my gun and advanced towards them. they appeared
much allarmed but saw that we were to near for them to escape by flight they
therefore seated themselves on the ground, holding down their heads as if reconciled
to die which the[y] expected no doubt would be their fate; I took the elderly woman
by the hand and raised her up repeated the word tab-ba-bone and strip[ped] up my
shirt sleve to s[h]ew her my skin; to prove to her the truth of the ascertain that I
was a white man for my face and ha[n]ds which have been constantly exposed to
the sun were quite as dark as their own. they appeared instantly reconciled, and the
men coming up I gave these women some beads a few mockerson awls some
pewter looking-glasses and a little paint.
I directed Drewyer to request the old woman to recall the young woman who had
run off to some distance by this time fearing she might allarm the camp before we
approached and might so exas-

Page 191
perate the natives that they would perhaps attack us without enquiring who we
were.2 the old woman did as she was requested and the fugitive soon returned
almost out of breath. I bestoed an equ[i]volent portion of trinket on her with the
others. I now painted their tawny cheeks with some vermillion which with this nation
is emblematic of peace. after they had become composed I enformed them by signs
that I wished them to conduct us to their camp that we wer anxious to become
acquainted with the chiefs and warriors of their nation. they readily obeyed and we
set out, still pursuing the road down the river. we had marched about 2 miles when
we met a party of about 60 warriors mounted on excellent horses who came in
nearly full speed, when they arrived I advanced towards them with the flag leaving
my gun with the party about 50 paces behi[n]d me. the chief and two others who
were a little in advance of the main body spoke to the women, and they informed
them who we were and exultingly shewed the presents which had been given them
these men then advanced and embraced me very affectionately in their way which is
by puting their left arm over you[r] wright sholder clasping your back, while they
apply their left cheek to yours and frequently vociforate the word âh-hí-e, âh-hí-e
that is, I am much pleased, I am much rejoiced. bothe parties now advanced and we
wer all carresed and besmeared with their grease and paint till I was heartily tired of
the national hug. I now had the pipe lit and gave them smoke; they seated
themselves in a circle around us and pulled of[f] their mockersons before they would
receive or smoke the pipe. this is a custom among them as I afterwards learned
indicative of a sacred obligation of sincerity in their profession of friendship given by
the act of receiving and smoking the pipe of a stranger. or which is as much as to
say that they wish they may always go bearfoot if they are not sincere; a pretty
heavy penalty if they are to march through the plains of their country.
after smoking a few pipes with them I distributed some trifles among them, with
which they seemed much pleased particularly with the blue beads and vermillion. I
now informed the chief that the object of our visit was a friendly one, that after we
should reach his camp I would undertake to explain to him fully those
2 Drewyer is, of course, addressing the old woman in sign language, the
Esperanto of the Plains tribes.

Page 192
objects, who we wer, from whence we had come and w[h]ither we were going; that
in the mean time I did not care how soon we were in motion, as the sun was very
warm and no water at hand. they now put on their mockersons, and the principal
chief Ca-meâh-wait made a short speach to the warriors. I gave him the flag which I
informed him was an emblem of peace among whitemen and now that it had been
received by him it was to be respected as the bond of union between us. I desired
him to march on, which [he] did and we followed him; the dragoons moved on in
squadron in our rear. after we had marched about a mile in this order he halted them
and gave a second harang; after which six or eight of the young men road forward to
their encampment and no further regularity was observed in the order of march. I
afterwards understood that the Indians we had first seen this morning had returned
and allarmed the camp; these men had come out armed cap a pe for action
expecting to meet with their enimies the Minnetares of Fort de Prarie whome they
Call Pâh'-kees. they were armed with b[o]ws arrow and Shields except three whom I
observed with small pieces such as the N.W. Company furnish the natives with which
they had obtained from the Rocky Mountain Indians on the Yellow stone river with
whom they are at peace. on our arrival at their encampmen[t] on the river in a
handsome level and fertile bottom at the distance of 4 Ms. from where we had first
met them they introduced us to a londge made of willow brush and an old leather
lodge which had been prepared for our reception by the young men which the chief
had dispatched for that purpose.
Here we were seated on green boughs and the skins of Antelopes. one of the
warriors then pulled up the grass in the center of the lodge forming a smal[l] circle of
about 2 feet in diameter the chief next produced his pipe and native tobacco and
began a long cerimony of the pipe when we were requested to take of[f] our
mockersons, the Chief having previously taken off his as well as all the warriors
present. this we complyed with; the Chief then lit his pipe at the fire kindled in this
little magic circle, and standing on the oposite side of the circle uttered a speach of
several minutes in length at the conclusion of which he pointed the stem to the four
cardinal points of the heavens first begining at the East and ending with the North.
he now presented the pipe to me as if desirous that I should smoke, but when I
reached my hand to

Page 193
receive it, he drew it back and repeated the same c[e]remony three times, after
which he pointed the stem first to the heavens then to the center of the magic circle
smoked himself with three whifs and held the pipe untill I took as many as I thought
proper; he then held it to each of the white persons and then gave it to be consumed
by his warriors.
I now explained to them the objects of our journey &c. all the women and children of
the camp were shortly collected about the lodge to indulge themselves with looking
at us, we being the first white persons they had ever seen. after the cerimony of the
pipe was over I distributed the remainder of the small articles I had brought with me
among the women and children. by this time it was late in the evening and we had
not taisted any food since the evening before. the Chief informed us that they had
nothing but berries to eat and gave us some cakes of serviceberries and Choke
cherries which had been dryed in the sun; of these I made a hearty meal, and then
walked to the river, which I found about 40 yards wide very rapid clear and about 3
feet deep.3 Cameahwait informed me that this stream discharged itself into another
doubly as large at the distance of half a days march which came from the S.W. but
he added on further enquiry that there was but little more timber below the junction
of those rivers than I saw here, and that the river was confined between
inaccessable mountains, was very rapid and rocky insomuch that it was impossible
for us to pass either by land or water down this river to the great lake where the
white men lived as he had been informed. this was unwelcome information but I still
hoped that this account had been exagerated with a view to detain us among them.
as to timber I could discover not any that would answer the purpose of constructing
canoes or in short more than was bearly necessary for fuel.
these people had been attacked by the Minetares of Fort de prarie4 this spring and
about 20 of them killed and taken prisoners. on this occasion they lost a great part of
their horses and all their lodges except that which they had erected for our
accomodation; they were now living in lodges of a conic figure made of
3 Lemhi River. It flows northward to the main fork of Salmon River. So it
corresponds to the information which the Minnetarees had given him at Fort
Mandan.
4 The Fall Indians, the Atsina, not the Minnetarees.

willow brush. I still observe a great number of horses feeding in every direction
around their camp and therefore entertain but little doubt but we shall be enable[d]
to furnish ourselves with an adiquate number to transport our stores even if we are
compelled to travel by land over these mountains. on my return to my lodge an
indian called me in to his bower and gave me a small morsel of the flesh of an
antelope boiled and a piece of a fresh salmon roasted; both which I eat with a very
good relish. this was the first salmon I had seen and perfectly convinced me that we
were on the waters of the Pacific Ocean.
This evening the Indians entertained us with their dancing nearly all night. at 12
O'Ck. I grew sleepy and retired to rest leaving the men to amuse themselves with
the Indians. I observe no essential difference between the music and manner of
dancing among this nation and those of the Missouri. I was several times awoke in
the course of the night by their yells but was too much fortiegued to be deprived of a
tolerable sound night's repose.
WEDNESDAY AUGUST 14TH
In order to give Capt. Clark time to reach the forks of Jefferson's river I concluded to
spend this day at the Shoshone Camp and obtain what information I could with
rispect to the country. as we had nothing but a little flour and parched meal to eat
except the berries with which the Indians furnished us I directed Drewyer and
Shields to hunt a few hours and try to kill something, the Indians furnished them
with horses and most of their young men also turned out to hunt. I was very much
entertained with a view of this indian chase; it was after a herd of about 10 Antelope
and about 20 hunters. it lasted about 2 hours and considerable part of the chase in
view from my tent. about 1.A.M. the hunters returned had not killed a single
Antelope, and their horses foaming with sweat. my hunters returned soon after and
had been equally unsuccessfull. I now directed McNeal to make me a little paist with
the flour and added some berries to it which I found very pallatable.
The means I had of communicating with these people was by way of Drewyer who
understood perfectly the common language of jesticulation or signs which seems to
be universally understood by all the Nations we have yet seen. it is true that this
language is

Page 195
imperfect and liable to error but is much less so than would be expected. the strong
parts of the ideas are seldom mistaken.
I now told Cameahwait that I wished him to speak to his people and engage them to
go with me tomorrow to the forks of Jeffersons river where our baggage was by this
time arrived with another Chief and a large party of whitemen who would wait my
return at that place. that I wish them to take with them about 30 spare horses to
transport our baggage to this place where we would then remain sometime among
them and trade with them for horses, and finally concert our future plans for getting
on to the ocean and of the traid which would be extended to them after our return to
our homes. he complyed with my request and made a lengthey harrangue to his
village. he returned in about an hour and a half and informed me that they would be
ready to accompany me in the morning. I promised to reward them for their trouble.
Drewyer who had had a good view of their horses estimated them at 400. most of
them are fine horses. indeed many of them would make a figure on the South side of
James River or the land of fine horses. I saw several with spanish brands on them,
and some mules which they informed me that they had also obtained from the
Spaniards. I also saw a bridle bit of spanish manufactary, and sundry other articles
which I have no doubt were obtained from the same source. notwithstanding the
extreem poverty of those poor people they are very merry they danced again this
evening untill midnight. each warrior keep[s] one or more horses tyed by a cord to a
stake near his lodge both day and night and are always prepared for action at a
moments warning. they fight on horseback altogether. I observe that the large flies
are extreemly troublesome to the horses as well as ourselves.
THURSDAY AUGUST 15TH 1805.
This morning I arrose very early and as hungary as a wolf. I had eat nothing
yesterday except one scant meal of the flour and berries except the dryed cakes of
berries which did not appear to satisfy my appetite as they appeared to do those of
my Indian friends. I found on enquiry of McNeal that we had only about two pounds
of flour remaining. this I directed him to divide into two equal parts and to cook the
one half this morning in a kind of pudding with the burries as he had done yesterday
and reserve the ballance for the evening. on this new fashoned pudding four of us
break-

Page 196
fasted, giving a pretty good allowance also to the Chief who declared it the best thing
he had taisted for a long time. he took a little of the flour in his hand, taisted and
examined [it] very scrutinously and asked me if we made it of roots. I explained to
him the manner in which it grew. I hurried the departure of the Indians. the Chief
addressed them several times before they would move they seemed very reluctant
to accompany me. I at length asked the reason and he told me that some foolish
persons among them had suggested the idea we were in league with the Pahkees
and had come on in order to decoy them into an ambuscade where their enimies
were waiting to receive them. but that for his part he did not believe it. I readily
perceived that our situation was not enterely free from danger as the transicion from
suspicion to the confermation of the fact would not be very difficult in the minds of
these ignorant people who have been accustomed from their infancy to view every
stranger as an enimy.
I told Cameahwait that I was sorry to find that they had put so little confidence in us,
that I knew they were not acquainted with whitemen and therefore could forgive
them. that among whitemen it was considered disgracefull to lye or entrap an enimy
by falsehood. I told him if they continued to think thus meanly of us that they might
rely on it that no whitemen would ever come to trade with them or bring them arms
and amunition and that if the bulk of his nation still entertained this opinion I still
hoped that there were some among them that were not affraid to die, that were men
and would go with me and convince themselves of the truth of what I had asscerted.
that there was a party of whitemen waiting my return either at the forks of
Jefferson's river or a little below coming on to that place in canoes loaded with
provisions and merchandize. he told me for his own part he was determined to go,
that he was not affraid to die. I soon found that I had touched him on the right
string; to doubt the bravery of a savage is at once to put him on his metal. he now
mounted his horse and haranged his village a third time; the perport of which as he
afterwards told me was to inform them that he would go with us and convince
himself of the truth or falsity of what we had told him if he was sertain he should be
killed, that he hoped there were some of them who heard him were not affraid to die
with him and if there was to let him see them mount their horses and prepare to set
out. shortly after this harange he was joined by six or eight only and with these

Page 197
I smoked a pipe and directed the men to put on their packs being determined to set
out with them while I had them in the humour at half after 12 we set out, several of
the old women were crying and imploring the great sperit to protect their warriors as
if they were going to inevitable distruction.
we had not proceeded far before our party was augmented by ten or twelve more,
and before we reached the Creek which we had passed in the morning of the 13th it
appeared to me that we had all the men of the village and a number of women with
us. This may serve in some measure to ilustrate the capricious disposition of those
people, who never act but from the impulse of the moment. they were now very
cheerfull and gay, and two hours ago they looked as sirly as so many imps of
satturn. when we arrived at the spring on the side of the mountain where we had
encamped on the 12th the Chief insi[s]ted on halting to let the horses graize with
which I complyed and gave the Indians smoke. they are excessively fond of the
pipe; but have it not much in their power to indulge themselves with even their
native tobacco as they do not cultivate it themselves. after remaining about an hour
we again set out, and by engaging to make compensation to four of them for their
trouble obtained the previlege of riding with an indian myself and a similar situation
for each of my party. I soon found it more tiresome riding without [s]tirrups than
walking and of course chose the latter making the Indian carry my pack. about
sunset we reached the upper part of the level valley of the Cove which [we] now
called Shoshone Cove. the grass being birned on the North side of the river we
passed over to the south and encamped near some willow brush about 4 miles
above the narrow pass between the hills noticed as I came up this cove. the river
was here about six yards wide, and frequently damed up by the beaver. I had sent
Drewyer forward this evening before we halted to kill some meat but he was
unsuccessfull and did not rejoin us untill after dark I now cooked and [divided]
among six of us [to] eat the remaining pound of flour stired in a little boiling water.
FRIDAY AUGUST 16TH 1805.
I sent Drewyer and Shields before this morning in order to kill some meat as neither
the Indians nor ourselves had any thing to eat. I informed the C[h]ief of my view in
this measure, and re-

Page 198
quested that he would keep his young men with us lest by their hooping and noise
they should allarm the game and we should get nothing to eat, but so strongly were
there suspicions exited by this measure that two parties of discovery immediately set
out one on e[a]ch side of the valley to watch the hunters as I beleive to see whether
they had not been sent to give information of their approach to an enemy that they
still preswaided themselves were lying in wait for them. I saw that any further effort
to prevent their going would only add strength to their suspicions and therefore said
no more. after the hunters had been gone about an hour we set out. we had just
passed through the narrows when we saw one of the spies comeing up the level
plain under whip, the chief pawsed a little and seemed somewhat concerned, I felt a
good deel so myself and began to suspect that by some unfortunate accedent that
perhaps some of there enimies had straggled hither at this unlucky moment; but we
were all agreeably disappointed on the arrival of the young man to learn that he had
come to inform us that one of the whitemen had killed a deer.
in an instant they all gave their horses the whip and I was taken nearly a mile before
I could learn what were the tidings; as I was without [s]tirrups and an Indian behind
me the jostling was disageeable I therefore reigned up my horse and forbid the
indian to whip him who had given him the lash at every jum[p] for a mile fearing he
should loose a part of the feast. the fellow was so uneasy that he left me the horse
dismounted and ran on foot at full speed I am confident a mile. when they arrived
where the deer was which was in view of me they dismounted and ran in tumbling
over each other like a parcel of famished dogs each seizing and tearing away a part
of the intestens which had been previously thrown out by Drewyer who killed it; the
seen was such when I arrived that had I not have had a pretty keen appetite myself I
am confident I should not have taisted any part of the venison shortly. each one had
a peice of some discription and all eating most ravenously. some were eating the
kidnies the melt [spleen] and liver and the blood runing from the corners of their
mouths, others were in a similar situation with the paunch and guts but the exuding
substance in this case from their lips was of a different discription. one of the last
who att[r]acted my attention on particularly had been fortunate in his allotment or
reather active in the division, he

Page 199
had provided himself with about nine feet of the small guts one end of which he was
chewing on while with his hands he was squezzing the contents out at the other. I
really did not untill now think that human nature ever presented itself in a shape so
nearly allyed to the brute creation.
I viewed these poor starved divils with pity and compassion I directed McNeal to skin
the deer and reserved a quarter, the ballance I gave the Chief to be divided among
his people; they devoured the whole of it nearly without cooking.
I now boar obliquely to the left in order to interscept the creek where there was
some brush to make a fire, and arrived at this stream where Drewyer had killed a
second deer; here nearly the same seene was encared [enacted]. a fire being kindled
we cooked and eat and gave the ballance of the two deer to the Indians who eat the
whole of them even to the soft parts of the hoofs. Drewyer joined us at breakfast
with a third deer. of this I reserved a quarter and gave the ballance to the Indians.
they all appeared now to have filled themselves and were in a good humour. this
morning early soon after the hunters set out a considerable part of our escort
became allarmed and returned 28 men and three women only continued with us.
after eating and suffering the horses to graize about 2 hours we renued our march
and towa[r]ds evening arrived at the lower part of the cove Shields killed an Antelope
on the way a part of which we took and gave the remainder to the Indians.
being now informed of the place at which I expected to meat Capt. C. and the party
they insisted on making a halt, which was complyed with. we now dismounted and
the Chief with much cerimony put tippets about our necks such as they t[h]emselves
woar I redily perceived that this was to disguise us and owed it's origine to the same
cause already mentioned. to give them further confidence I put my cocked hat with
feather on the chief and my over shirt being of the Indian form my hair deshivled and
skin well browned with the sun I wanted no further addition to make me a complete
Indian in appearance the men followed my example and we were so[o]n completely
metamorphosed. I again repeated to them the possibility of the party not having
arrived at the place which I expected they were, but assured them they could not be
far below, lest by not finding them at the forks their suspicions might arrise to such
hight as to induce them to return precipi-

Page 200
tately. we now set out and rode briskly within sight of the forks making one of the
Indians carry the flag that our own party should know who we were. when we
arrived in sight at the distance of about 2 miles I discovered to my mortification that
the party had not arrived, and the Indians slackened their pace. I now scarcely new
what to do and feared every moment when they would halt altogether, I now
determined to restore their confidence cost what it might and therefore gave the
Chief my gun and told him that if his enimies were in those bushes before him that
he could defend himself with that gun, that for my own part I was not affraid to die
and if I deceived him he might make what uce of the gun he thought proper or in
other words that he might shoot me. the men also gave their guns to other indians
which seemed to inspire them with more confidence; they sent their spies before
them at some distance and when I drew near the place I thought of the notes which
I had left and directed Drewyer to go with an Indian man and bring them to me
which he did. the indian seeing him take the notes from the stake on which they had
been placed.
I now had recourse to a stratagem in which I thought myself justifyed by the
occasion, but which I must confess set a little awkward. it had it's desired effect.
after reading the notes which were the same I had left I told the Chief that when I
had left my brother Chief with the party below where the river entered the mountain
that we both agreed not to bring the canoes higher up than the next forks of the
river above us wherever this might happen, that there he was to wait my return,
should he arrive first, and that in the event of his not being able to travel as fast as
usual from the difficulty of the water, that he was to send up to the first forks above
him and leave a note informing me where he was, that this note was left here today
and that he informed me that he was just below the mountains and was coming
slowly up, and added that I should wait here for him, but if they did not believe me
that I should send a man at any rate to the Chief and they might also send one of
their young men with him, that myself and two others would remain with them at
this place. this plan was readily adopted and one of the young men offered his
services; I promised him a knife and some beads as a reward for his confidence in
us. most of them seemed satisfyed but there were several that complained of the
Chief's exposing them to danger unnecessarily and said that we

Page 201
told different stories, in short a few were much dissatisfyed. I wrote a note to Capt.
Clark by the light of some willow brush and directed Drewyer to set out early being
confident that there was not a moment to spare. the chief and five or six others slept
about my fire and the others hid themselves in various parts of the willow brush to
avoid the enimy whom they were fearfull would attack tham in the course of the
night. I now entertained various conjectures myself with rispect to the cause of Capt.
Clarks detention and was even fearfull that he had found the river so difficult that he
had halted below the Rattlesnake bluffs. I knew that if these people left me that they
would immediately disperse and secrete themselves in the mountains where it would
be impossible to find them or at least in vain to pursue them and that they would
spread the allarm to all other bands within our reach & of course we should be
disappointed in obtaining horses, which would vastly retard and increase the labour
of our voyage and I feared might so discourage the men as to defeat the expedition
altogether.
my mind was in reallity quite as gloomy all this evening as the most affrighted indian
but I affected cheerfullness to keep the Indians so who were about me. we finally
laid down and the Chief placed himself by the side of my musquetoe bier. I slept but
little as might be well expected, my mind dwelling on the state of the expedition
which I have ever held in equal estimation with my own existence, and the fait of
which appeared at this moment to depend in a great measure upon the caprice of a
few savages who are ever as fickle as the wind. I had mentioned to the chief several
times that we had with us a woman of his nation who had been taken prisoner by the
Minnetares, and that by means of her I hoped to explain myself more fully than I
could do signs. some of the party had also told the Indians that we had a man with
us who was black and had short curling hair, this had excited their curiossity very
much. and they seemed quite as anxious to see this monster as they wer[e] the
merchandize which we had to barter for their horses.

Chapter XV
Crossing the Great Divide
[Biddle] SATURDAY, AUGUST 17TH, 1805.
Captain Lewis rose very early and despatched Drewyer and the Indian down the river
in quest of the boats. Shields was sent out at the same time to hunt, while M'Neal
prepared a breakfast out of the remainder of the meat. Drewyer had been gone
about two hours, and the Indians were all anxiously waiting for some news, when an
Indian who had straggled a short distance down the river, returned with a report that
he had seen the white men, who were only a short distance below, and were coming
on. the Indians were all transported with joy, and the chief in the warmth of his
satisfaction renewed his embrace to Capt. Lewis, who was quite as much delighted
as the Indians themselves; the report proved most agreeably true.
On setting out at seven o'clock, Captain Clarke with Chaboneau and his wife walked
on shore, but they had not gone more than a mile before Clarke saw Sacajawea,
who was with her husband 100 yards ahead, began to dance and show every mark
of the most extravagant joy, turning round him and pointing to several Indians,
whom he now saw advancing on horseback, sucking her fingers at the same time to
indicate that they were of her native tribe. As they advanced, Captain Clarke
discovered among them Drewyer dressed like an Indian, from whom he learnt the
situation of the party. While the boats were performing the circuit, he went towards
the forks with the Indians, who as they went along, sang aloud with the greatest
appearance of delight.
We soon drew near to the camp, and just as we approached it a

Page 203
woman made her way through the croud towards Sacajawea, and recognising each
other, they embraced with the most tender affection. The meeting of these two
young women had in it something peculiarly touching, not only in the ardent manner
in which their feelings were expressed, but from the real interest of their situation.
They had been companions in childhood, in the war with the Minnetarees they had
both been taken prisoners in the same battle, they had shared and softened the
rigours of their captivity, till one of them had escaped from the Minnetarees, with
scarce a hope of ever seeing her friend relieved from the hands of her enemies.
While Sacajawea was renewing among the women the friendships of former days,
Captain Clarke went on, and was received by Captain Lewis and the chief, who after
the first embraces and salutations were over, conducted him to a sort of circular tent
or shade of willows. Here he was seated on a white robe; and the chief immediately
tied in his hair six small shells resembling pearls, an ornament highly valued by these
people, who procure them in the course of trade from the sea-coast. The moccasins
of the whole party were then taken off, and after much ceremony the smoking
began. After this the conference was to be opened, and glad of an opportunity of
being able to converse more intelligibly, Sacajawea was sent for; she came into the
tent, sat down, and was beginning to interpret, when in the person of Cameahwait
she recognised her brother: She instantly jummped up, and ran and embraced him,
throwing over him her blanket and weeping profusely: The chief was himself moved,
though not in the same degree. After some conversation between them she resumed
her seat, and attempted to interpret for us, but her new situation seemed to
overpower her, and she was frequently interrupted by her tears. After the council
was finished the unfortunate woman learnt that all her family were dead except two
brothers, one of whom was absent, and a son of her eldest sister, a small boy, who
was immediately adopted by her.
[Lewis] SATURDAY AUGUST 17TH 1805.
we made them [the Indians] sensible of their dependence on the will of our
government for every species of merchandize as well for their defence & comfort;
and apprized them of the strength of our government and it's friendly dispositions
towards them. we

Page 204
also gave them as a reason why we wished to pe[ne]trate the country as far as the
ocean to the west of them was to examine and find out a more direct way to bring
merchandize to them. that as no trade could be carryed on with them before our
return to our homes that it was mutually advantageous to them as well as to
ourselves that they should render us such aids as they had in their power to furnish
in order to haisten our voyage and of course our return home. that such were their
horses to transport our baggage without which we could not subsist, and that a pilot
to conduct us through the mountains was also necessary if we could not decend the
river by water. but that we did not ask either their horses or their services without
giving a satisfactory compensation in return. that at present we wished them to
collect as many horses as were necessary to transport our baggage to their village
on the Columbia where we would then trade with them at our leasure for such
horses as they could spare us.
the chief thanked us for friendship towards himself and nation & declared his wish to
serve us in every rispect. that he was sorry to find that it must yet be some time
before they could be furnished with firearms but said they could live as they had
done heretofore untill we brought them as we had promised. he said they had not
horses enough with them at present to remove our baggage to their village over the
mountain, but that he would return tomorrow and encourage his people to come
over with their horses and that he would bring his own and assist us. this was
complying with all we wished at present.
we next enquired who were chiefs among them. Cameahwait pointed out two others
whom he said were Chiefs. we gave him a medal of the small size with the likeness
of Mr. Jefferson the President of the U' States in relief on one side and clasp hands
with a pipe and tomahawk in the other, to the other Chiefs we gave each a small
medal which were struck in the Presidency of George Washing[ton] Esqr. we also
gave small medals of the last discription to two young men whom the 1st Chief
informed us wer good young men and much rispected among them. we gave the 1st
Chief an uniform coat shirt a pair of scarlet legings a carrot of tobacco and some
small articles to each of the others we gave a shi[r]t leging[s] handkerchief a knife
some tobacco and a few small articles we also distributed a good quantity paint
mock-

Page 205
erson awles knives beads looking-glasses &c among the other Indians and gave
them a plentifull meal of lyed corn which was the first they had ever eaten in their
lives. they were much pleased with it. every article about us appeared to excite
astonishment in ther minds; the appearance of the men, their arms, the canoes, our
manner of working them, the b[l]ack man york and the sagacity of my dog were
equally objects of admiration. I also shot my air-gun which was so perfectly
incomprehensible that they immediately denominated it the great medicine.
Capt. Clark and myself now concerted measures for our future operations, and it was
mutually agreed that he should set out tomorrow morning with eleven men furnished
with axes and other necessary tools for making canoes, their arms accoutrements
and as much of their baggage as they could carry. also to take the indians,
C[h]arbono and the indian woman with him; that on his arrival at the Shoshone
camp he was to leave Charbono and the Indian woman to haisten the return of the
Indians with their horses to this place, and to proceede himself with the eleven men
down the Columbia in order to examine the river and if he found it navigable and
could obtain timber to set about making canoes immediately. In the mean time I was
to bring the party and baggage to the Shoshone Camp, calculating that by the time I
should reach that place that he would have sufficiently informed himself with rispect
to the state of the river &c. as to determine us whether to prosicute our journey from
thence by land or water. in the former case we should want all the horses which we
could perchase and in the latter only to hire the Indians to transport our baggage to
the place at which we made the canoes.
SUNDAY AUGUST 18TH 1805
This morning while Capt Clark was busily engaged in preparing for his rout, I
exposed some articles to barter with the Indians for horses as I wished a few at this
moment to releive the men who were going with Capt Clark from the labour of
carrying their baggage, and also one to keep here in order to pack the meat to camp
which the hunters might kill. I soon obtained three very good horses. for which I
gave an uniform coat, a pair of legings, a few handkerchiefs, three knives and some
other small articles the whole

Page 206
of which did not cost more than about 20$ in the U' States. the Indians seemed quite
as well pleased with their bargin as I was. the men also purchased one for an old
checked shirt a pair of old legings and a knife. two of those I purchased Capt. C.
took on with him. at 10 A.M. Capt. Clark departed with his detachment and all the
Indians except 2 men and 2 women who remained with us.
after there departure this morning I had all the stores and baggage of every
discription opened and aired. and began the operation of forming the packages in
proper parsels for the purpose of transporting them on horseback. the rain in the
evening compelled me to desist from my operations. I had the raw hides put in the
water in order to cut them in throngs proper for lashing the packages and forming
the necessary geer for pack horses, a business which I fortunately had not to learn
on this occasion. I had the net arranged and set this evening to catch some trout
which we could see in great abundance at the bottom of the river.
This day I completed my thirty first year, and conceived that I had in all human
probability now existed about half the period which I am to remain in this Sublunary
world. I reflected that I had as yet done but little, very little, indeed, to further the
hapiness of the human race or to advance the information of the succeeding
generation. I viewed with regret the many hours I have spent in indolence, and now
soarly feel the want of that information which those hours would have given me had
they been judiciously expended. but since they are past and cannot be recalled, I
dash from me the gloomy thought, and resolved in future, to redouble my exertions
and at least indeavour to promote those two primary objects of human existence, by
giving them the aid of that portion of talents which nature and fortune have bestoed
on me; or in future, to live for mankind, as I have heretofore lived for myself.
[Clark] AUGUST 18TH SUNDAY 1805
at 10 oClock I set out accompanied by the Indians except 3 the interpreter and wife,
the fore part of the day worm, at 12 oClock it became hasey with a mist of rain wind
hard from the S.W. and cold which increased until night the rain Seased in about two
hours. We proceeded on thro' a wide leavel vallie without wood except willows &
Srubs for 15 miles and Encamped at a

Page 207
place the high lands approach within 200 yards in 2 points the River here only 10
yards wide Several Small Streams branching out on each Side below. all the Indians
proceeded on except the 3 Chiefs & two young men.
[Lewis] MONDAY AUGUST 19TH 1805
The Shoshonees may be estimated at about 100 warriors, and about three times that
number of woomen and children.1 they have more children among them than I
expected to have seen among a people who procure subsistence with such difficulty.
there are but few very old persons, nor did they appear to treat those with much
tenderness or rispect. The man is the sole propryetor of his wives and daughters,
and can barter or dispose of either as he thinks proper. a plurality of wives is
common among them, but these are not generally sisters as with the Minnitares &
Mandans but are purchased of different fathers. The father frequently disposes of his
infant daughters in marriage to men who are grown or to men who have sons for
whom they think proper to provide wives. the compensation given in such cases
usually consists of horses or mules which the father receives at the time of contract
and converts to his own uce. the girl remains with her parents untill she is conceived
to have obtained the age of puberty which with them is considered to be about the
age of 13 or 14 years. the female at this age is surrendered to her soveriegn lord and
husband agreeably to contract, and with her is frequently restored by the father
quite as much as he received in the first instance in payment for his daughter; but
this is discretionary with the father. Sah-car-gar-we-ah had been thus disposed of
before she was taken by the Minnetares, or had arrived to the years of puberty. the
husband was yet living with this band. he was more than double her age and had
two other wives. he claimed her as his wife but said that as she had had a child by
another man, who was Charbono, that he did not want her.
They seldom correct their children particularly the boys who soon become masters of
their own acts. they give as a reason that it cows and breaks the sperit of the boy to
whip him, and that he never recovers his independence of mind after he is grown.
They
1 Lewis's figures refer to this band only.

Page 208
treat their women but with little rispect, and compel them to perform every species
of drudgery. they collect the wild fruits and roots, attend to the horses or assist in
that duty, cook, dress the skins and make all their apparel, collect wood and make
their fires, arrange and form their lodges, and when they travel pack the horses and
take charge of all the baggage; in short the man dose little else except attend his
horses hunt and fish. the man considers himself degraded if he is compelled to walk
any distance; and if he is so unfortunately poor as only to possess two horses he
rides the best himself and leavs the woman or women if he has more than one, to
transport their baggage and children on the other, and to walk if the horse is unable
to carry the additional weight of their persons. the chastity of their women is not
held in high estimation, and the husband will for a trifle barter the companion of his
bead for a night or longer if he conceives the reward adiquate; tho' they are not so
importunate that we should caress their women as the siouxs were. and some of
their women appear to be held more sacred than in any nation we have seen. I have
requested the men to give them no cause of jealousy by having connection with their
women without their knowledge, which with them, strange as it may seem is
considered as disgracefull to the husband as clandestine connections of a similar
kind are among civilized nations. to prevent this mutual exchange of good officies
altogether I know it impossible to effect, particularly on the part of our young men
whom some months abstanence have made very polite to those tawney damsels. no
evil has yet resulted and I hope will not from these connections.
notwithstanding the late loss of horses which this people sustained by the Minnetares
the stock of the band may be very safely estimated at seven hundred of which they
are perhaps about 40 coalts and half that number of mules. their arms offensive and
defensive consist in the bow and arrows shield, some, lances, and a weapon called
by the Cippeways who formerly used it, the poggar'-mag'-gon' [war club]. in fishing
they employ wairs, gigs, and fishing hooks. the salmon is the principal object of their
pursuit. they snair wolves and foxes.
I was anxious to learn whether these people had the venerial, and made the enquiry
through the intrepreter and his wife; the information was that they sometimes had it
but I could not learn

Page 209
their remedy; they most usually die with it's effects. this seems a strong proof that
these disorders bothe ganaræhah and Louis Veneræ are native disorders of America.
tho' these people have suffered much by the small pox which is known to be
imported and perhaps those other disorders might have been contracted from other
indian tribes who by a round of communications might have obtained from the
Europeans since it was introduced into that quarter of the globe. but so much
detatched on the other ha[n]d from all communication with the whites that I think it
most probable that those disorders are original with them.
from the middle of May to the first of September these people reside on the waters of
the Columbia where they consider themselves in perfect security from their enimies
as they have not as yet ever found their way to this retreat; during this season the
salmon furnish the principal part of their subsistence and as this fish either perishes
or returns about the 1st of September they are compelled at this season in surch of
subsistence to resort to the Missouri, in the vallies of which, there is more game
even [than] within the mountains. here they move slowly down the river in order to
collect and join other bands either of their own nation or the Flatheads, and having
become sufficiently strong as they conceive venture on the Eastern side of the
Rockey mountains into the plains, where the buffaloe abound. but they never leave
the interior of the mountains while they can obtain a scanty subsistence, and always
return as soon as they have acquired a good stock of dryed meat in the plains; when
this stock is consumed they venture again into the plains; thus alternately obtaining
their food at the risk of their lives and retiring to the mountains, while they consume
it. These people are now on the eve of their departure for the Missouri, and inform us
that they expect to be joined at or about the three forks by several bands of their
own nation, and a band of the Flatheads.

considered of great value among those people we proceeded on over a verry
mountainous Countrey across the head of hollows & Springs
[Lewis] TUESDAY AUGUST 20TH 1805.
I walked down the river about 3\4 of a mile and selected a place near the river bank
unperceived by the Indians for a cash [cache], which I set three men to make, and
directed the centinel to discharge his gun if he perceived any of the Indians going
down in that direction which was to be the signal for the men at work on the cash to
desist and seperate, least these people should discover our deposit and rob us of the
baggage we intend leaving here. by evening the cash was completed unperceived by
the Indians, and all our packages made up. the Pack-saddles and harnes is not yet
complete. in this operation we find ourselves at a loss for nails and boards; for the
first we substitute throngs of raw hide which answer verry well, and for the last
[had] to cut off the blades of our oars and use the plank of some boxes which have
heretofore held other articles and put those articles into sacks of raw hide which I
have had made for the purpose. by this means I have obtained as many boards as
will make 20 saddles which I suppose will be sufficient for our present exegencies. I
made up a small assortment of medicines, together with the specemines of plants,
minerals, seeds &c, which, I have collected between this place and the falls of the
Missouri which I shall deposit here.
I now prevailed on the Chief to instruct me with rispect to the geography of his
country. this he undertook very cheerfully, by delienating the rivers on the ground.
but I soon found that his information fell far short of my expectation or wishes. he
drew the river on which we now are [the Lemhi] to which he placed two branches
just above us, which he shewed me from the openings of the mountains were in
view; he next made it discharge itself into a large river which flowed from the S.W.
about ten miles below us

Page 211
[the Salmon], then continued this joint stream in the same direction of this valley or
N.W. for one days march and then enclined it to the West for 2 more days march.
here he placed a number of heaps of sand on each side which he informed me
represented the vast mountains of rock eternally covered with snow through which
the river passed. that the perpendicular and even juting rocks so closely hemned in
the river that there was no possibil[it]y of passing along the shore; that the bed of
the river was obstructed by sharp pointed rocks and the rapidity of the stream such
that the whole surface of the river was beat into perfect foam as far as the eye could
reach. that the mountains were also inaccessible to man or horse. he said that this
being the state of the country in that direction that himself nor none of his nation had
ever been further down the river than these mountains.
I then enquired the state of the country on either side of the river but he could not
inform me. he said there was an old man of his nation a days march below who
could probably give me some information of the country to the N.W. and refered me
to an old man then present for that to the S.W. the Chief further informed me that he
had understood from the persed nosed [Nez Percé] Indians who inhabit this river
below the rocky mountains that it ran a great way toward the seting sun and finally
lost itself in a great lake of water which was illy taisted, and where the white men
lived. I next commenced my enquiries of the old man to whom I had been refered for
information relative the country SW. of us. this he depicted with horrors and
obstructions scarcely inferior to that just mentioned.2 he informed me that the band
of this nation to which he belonged resided at the distance of 20 days march from
hence not far from the white people with whom they traded for horses mules cloth
metal beads and the shells which they woar as orniment being those of a species of
perl oister. that the course to his relations was a little to the West of South. that in
order to get to his relations the first seven days we should be obliged to climb over
steep and rocky mountains where we could find no game to kill nor anything but
roots such as a ferce and
2 From here on the old man's information is unreliable. Almost all of what he
says is hearsay and guess. His own errors and misconceptions and Lewis's
misunderstanding and geographical preconceptions unite to produce a
fantastic picture of the country west and southwest of Lemhi Pass. The
passage is analyzed in DeVoto, The Course of Empire, Chap. XII.

Page 212
warlike nation lived on whom he called the broken mockersons or mockersons with
holes, and said inhabited those mountains and lived like the bear of other countries
among the rocks and fed on roots or the flesh of such horses as they could take or
steel from those who passed through their country. that in passing this country the
feet of our horses would be so much wounded with the stones many of them would
give out. the next part of the rout was about 10 days through a dry and parched
sandy desert in which [there is] no food at this season for either man or horse, and
in which we must suffer if not perish for the want of water.3 that the sun had now
dryed up the little pools of water which exist through this desert plain in the spring
season and had also scorched all the grass. that no animal inhabited this plain on
which we could hope to subsist. that about the center of this plain a large river
passed from S.E. to N.W. which was navigable but afforded neither Salmon nor
timber. that beyond this plain th[r]ee or four days march his relations lived in a
country tolerable fertile and partially covered with timber on another large river
which ran in the same direction of the former. that this last discharged itself into a
large river on which many numerous nations lived with whom his relations were at
war but whether this last discharged itself into the great lake or not he did not know.
that from his relations it was yet a great distance to the great or stinking lake as they
call the Ocean. that the way which such of his nation as had been to the Stinking
lake traveled was up the river on which they lived and over to that on which the
white people lived which last they knew discharged itself into the Ocean, and that
this was the way which he would advise me to travel if I was determined to proceed
to the Ocean but would advise me to put off the journey untill the next spring when
he would conduct me. I thanked him for his information and advise and gave him a
knife with which he appeared to be much gratifyed.
from this narrative I was convinced that the streams of which he had spoken as
runing through the plains and that on which his relations lived were southern
branches of the Columbia, heading with the rivers Apostles and Collorado, and that
the rout he had pointed out was to the Vermillion Sea or gulph of Callifornia.4 I

Page 213
therefore told him that this rout was more to the South than I wished to travel, and
requested to know if there was no rout on the left of this river on which we now are,
by means of which, I could intercept it below the mountains through which it passes;
but he could not inform me of any except that of the barren plain which he said
joined the mountain on that side and through which it was impossible for us to pass
at this season even if we were fortunate enough to escape from the broken
mockerson Indians. I now asked Cameahwait by what rout the Pierced nosed
indians, who he informed me inhabited this river below the mountains, came over to
the Missouri; this he informed me was to the north, but added that the road was a
very bad one as he had been informed by them and that they had suffered
excessively with hunger on the rout being obliged to subsist for many days on
berries alone as there was no game in that part of the mountains which were broken
rockey and so thickly covered with timber that they could scarcely pass.5 however
knowing that Indians had passed, and did pass, at this season on that side of this
river to the same below the mountains, my rout was instantly settled in my own
mind, p[r]ovided the account of this river should prove true on an investigation of it,
which I was determined should be made before we would undertake the rout by land
in any direction. I felt perfectly satisfyed, that if the Indians could pass these
mountains with their women and Children, that we could also pass them; and that if
the nations on this river below the mountains were as numerous as they were stated
to be that they must have some means of sub sistence which it would be equally in
our power to procure in the same country. they informed me that there was no
buffaloe on the West side of these mountains; that the game consisted of a few Elk
deer and Antelopes, and that the natives subsisted on fish and roots principally.
in this manner I spent the day smoking with them and acquiring what information I
could with respect to their country. they in formed me that they could pass to the
Spaniards by the way of the yellowstone river in 10 days. I can discover that these
people are by no means friendly to the Spaniards. their complaint is, that the
Spaniards will not let them have fire arms and amunition, that they put them off by
telling them that if they suffer them to have guns they will kill each other, thus
leaving them defenceless and
5 This is vital information and it is correct.

Page 214
an easy prey to their bloodthirsty neighbours to the East of them, who being in
possession of fire arms hunt them up and murder them without rispect to sex or age
and plunder them of their horses on all occasions. they told me that to avoid their
enemies who were eternally harrassing them that they were obliged to remain in the
interior of these mountains at least two thirds of the year where the[y] suffered as
we then saw great heardships for the want of food sometimes living for weeks
without meat and only a little fish roots and berries. but this added Câmeahwait, with
his ferce eyes and lank jaws grown meager for the want of food, would not be the
case if we had guns, we could then live in the country of buffaloe and eat as our
enimies do and not be compelled to hide ourselves in these mountains and live on
roots and berries as the bear do. we do not fear our enimies when placed on an
equal footing with them. I told them that the Minnetares Mandans & recares of the
Missouri had promised us to desist from making war on them & that we would
indevour to find the means of making the Minnetares of fort d[e] Prarie or as they
call them Pahkees desist from waging war against them also. that after our finally
returning to our homes towards the rising sun whitemen would come to them with
an abundance of guns and every other article necesssary to their defence and
comfort, and that they would be enabled to supply themselves with these articles on
reasonable terms in exchange for the skins of the beaver Otter and Ermin so
abundant in their country. they expressed great pleasure at this information and said
they had been long anxious to see the whitemen that traded guns; and that we
might rest assured of their friendship and that they would do whatever we wished
them.

''SO-SO-NE'' THE SNAKE INDIANS
Set out at half past 6 oClock and proceeded on (met maney parties of Indians) thro'
a hilley Countrey to the Camp of the Indians on a branch of the Columbia River,
before we entered this Camp a Serimonious hault was requested by the Chief and I
smoked with all that Came around, for Several pipes, we then proceeded on to the
Camp & I was introduced into the only Lodge they had which was pitched in the
Center for my party all the

Page 215
other Lodges made of bushes, after a fiew Indian Seremonies I informed the Indians
the object of our journey our good intentions towards them my Consirn for their
distressed Situation, what we had done for them in makeing a piece with the
Minitarras Mandans Rickara &c. for them. and requested them all to take over their
horses & assist Capt Lewis across &c. also informing them the object of my journey
down the river, and requested a guide to accompany me, all of which was repeited
by the Chief to the whole village.
Those pore people Could only raise a Sammon & a little dried Choke Cherries for us
half the men of the tribe with the Chief turned out to hunt the antilopes, at 3 oClock
after giveing a fiew Small articles as presents I set out accompanied by an old man
as a Guide I endevered to procure as much information from thos people as possible
without much Suckcess they being but little acquainted or effecting to be So. I left
one man to purchase a horse and overtake me and proceeded on thro a wide rich
bottom on a beaten Roade 8 miles Crossed the river and encamped on a Small run, I
left our interpreter & his woman to accompany the Indians to Capt Lewis tomorrow
the Day they informed me they would Set out.

Searching for Navigable Waters
[Lewis] WEDNESDAY AUGUST 21ST 1805.
This morning was very cold. the ice 1/4 of an inch thick on the water which stood in
the vessels exposed to the air. some wet deerskins that had been spread on the
grass last evening are stiffly frozen. the ink f[r]eizes in my pen. the bottoms are
perfectly covered with frost, insomuch that they appear to be covered with snow.
This morning early I dispatched two hunters to kill some meat if possible before the
Indians arrive; Drewyer I sent with the horse into the cove for that purpose. The
party pursued their several occupations as yesterday. by evening I had all the
baggage, saddles, and harness completely ready for a march. after dark, I made the
men take the baggage to the cash and deposit it. I beleve we have been unperceived
by the Indians in this movement. notwithstanding the coldness of the last night the
day has proved excessively warm. neither of the hunters returned this evening and I
was obliged to issue pork and corn.
The mockersons of both sexes are usually the same and are made of deer Elk or
buffaloe skin dressed without the hair. sometimes in the winter they make them of
buffaloe skin dressed with the hair on and turn the hair inwards as the Mandans
Minetares and most of the nations do who inhabit the buffaloe country. the
mockerson is formed with one seem on the outer edge of the foot is cut open at the
instep to admit the foot and sewed up behind. in this rispect they are the same with
the Mandans. they sometimes ornament their mockersons with various figures
wrought with the quills of the Porcupine.
some of the dressey young men orniment the tops of their mock-

Page 217
ersons with the skins of polecats and trale the tail of that animal on the ground at
their heels as they walk. the robe of the woman is generally smaller than that of the
man but is woarn in the same manner over the sholders. the Chemise is roomy and
comes down below the middle of the leg the upper part of this garment is formed
much like the shirt of the men except the sholder strap which is never used with the
Chemise. in woman who give suck, they are left open at the sides nearly as low as
the waist, in others, close as high as the sleeve. the sleeve underneath as low as the
elbow is open, that part being left very full. the sides tail and upper part of the
sleeves are deeply fringed and sometimes ornimented in a similar manner with the
shirts of the men with the addition of little patches of red cloth about the tail edged
around with beads. the breast is usually ornamented with various figures of party
colours rought with the quills of the Porcupine. it is on this part of the garment that
they appear to exert their greatest engenuity. a girdle of dressed leather confines the
Chemise around the waist. the legings of the women reach as high as the knee and
are confined with a garter below. the mockerson covers and confins it's lower
extremity. they are neither fringed nor ornamented. these legings are made of the
skins of the antelope and the Chemise usually of those of the large deer Bighorn and
the smallest elk.
the warriors or such as esteem themselves brave men wear collars made of the
claws of the brown bear which are also esteemed of great value and are preserved
with great care. these claws are ornamented with beads about the thick end near
which they are peirced through their sides and strung on a throng of dressed leather
and tyed about the neck commonly with the upper edge of the tallon next the breast
or neck but sometimes are reversed. it is esteemed by them an act of equal celebrity
the killing one of these bear or an enimy, and with the means they have of killing this
animal it must really be a serious undertaking.
[Clark] AUGUST 21ST WEDNESDAY 1805
I entered a lodge and after smokeing with all who Came about me I went to see the
place those people take the fish, a wear [weir] across the Creek in which there is
Stuk baskets Set in different derections So as to take the fish either decending or
assending Their method of takeing fish with a gig or bone is with a

Page 218
long pole, about a foot from one End is a Strong String attached to the pole, this
String is a little more than a foot long and is tied to the middle of a bone from 4 to 6
inches long, one end Sharp the other with a whole to fasten on the end of the pole
with a beard [barb] to the large end, the[y] fasten this bone on one end & with the
other, feel for the fish & turn and Strike them So hard that the bone passes through
and Catches on the opposit Side, Slips off the End of the pole and holds the Center of
the bone
Those Indians are mild in their disposition, appear Sincere in their friendship,
punctial, and decided. kind with what they have, to spare. They are excessive pore,
nothing but horses there Enemies which are noumerous on account of there horses
& Defenceless Situation, have deprived them of tents and all the Small Conveniances
of life. They have only a few indifferent Knives, no ax, make use of Elk's horn
Sharpened to Sp[l]it ther wood, no clothes except a Short Legins & robes of different
animals, Beaver, Bear, Buffalow, wolf Panther, Ibex (Sheep), Deer, but most
commonly the antilope Skins which they ware loosely about them. The women are
held more sacred among them than any nation we have seen and appear to have an
equal Shere in all conversation, which is not the Case in any other nation I have
seen. their boys & girls are also admitted to speak except in Councels, the women
doe all the drugery except fishing and takeing care of the horses, which the men apr.
to take upon themselves. the most sacred of all the orniments of this nation is the
Sea Shells of various Sizes and Shapes and colours, of the bassterd perl kind, which
they inform us they get from the Indians to the South on the other Side of a large
fork of this river in passing to which they have to pass thro: Sandy & barron open
plains without water to which place they can travel in 15 or 20 days. The men who
passed by the forks informed me that the S W. fork was double the Size of the one I
came down, and I observed that it was a handsom river at my camp I shall in justice
to Capt. Lewis who was the first white man ever on this fork of the Columbia Call this
Louis's river.1
1 There are three principal forks of the Salmon River. The one into which the
Lemhi enters is recognized as the main fork. It flows north before turning
west, shortly after the entrance of the north fork. Some distance beyond this
entrance comes the first of the precipitous canyons whose steep side and swift
boulder-filled rapids forced Clark to decide that the expedition could not travel
it. From here on it is in no sense a navigable river, although specially built craft
occasionally descend it for sport. So far as the editor knows no one

[Lewis] THURSDAY AUGUST 22ED 1805.
This morning early I sent a couple of men to complete the covering of the cash which
could not be done well last night in the dark, they soon accomplished their work and
returned. late last night Drewyer returned with a fawn he had killed and a
considerable quantity of Indian plunder. the anecdote with rispect to the latter is
perhaps worthy of relation. he informed me that while hunting in the Cove yesterday
about 12 OCk. he came suddonly upon an Indian Camp, at which there were a young
man an Old man and a boy and three women, that they seemed but little supprised
at seeing him and he rode up to them and dismounted turning [his] horse out to
graize. these people had just finished their repast on some roots, he entered into
conversation with them by signs, and after 20 minutes one of the women spoke to
the others of the party and they all went immediately and collected their horses
brought them to camp and saddled them at this moment he thought he would also
set out and continue his hunt, and accordingly walked to catch his horse at some
little distance and neglected to take up his gun which he left at camp. the Indians
perceiving him at the distance of fifty paces immediately mounted their horses, the
young man took the gun, and the whole of them left their baggage and laid whip to
their horses directing their course to the pass of the mountains. finding himself
deprived of his gun he immediately mounted his horse and pursued; after runing
them about 10 miles the horses of two of the women nearly gave out and the young
fellow with the gun from their frequent crys slackened his pace and being on a very
fleet horse road around the women at a little distance at length Drewer overtook the
women and by signs convinced them that he did not wish to hirt them they then
halted and the young fellow approached still nearer, he asked him for his gun but the
only part of the answer which he could understand was pahkee which he knew to be
the name by which they called their enimies. watch(Footnote continued from previous page)
has ever ascended it by boat; locally it is called the River of No Return. After
passing through these canyons, and crossing the whole width of Idaho, it
empties into the Snake River about fifty miles upstream from the mouth of the
Clearwater River, by which the expedition was to reach the Snake.
The expedition traveled beside the north fork of the Salmon upstream, for some
distance on its way to Lost Trail Pass.

Page 220
ing his opportunity when the fellow was off his guard he suddonly rode along side of
him seized his gun and wrest her out of his hands. the fellow finding Drewyer too
strong for him and discovering that he must yeald the gun had p[r]esents of mind to
open the pan and cast the priming before he let the gun escape from his hands; now
finding himself devested of the gun he turned his horse about and laid whip leaving
the women to follow him as well as they could.
at 11.A.M. Charbono, the Indian Woman, Cameahwait and about 50 men with a
number of women and children arrived. they encamped near us. after they had
turned out their horses and arranged their camp I called the Cheifs and warriors
together and addressed them a second time; gave them some further presents,
particularly the second and third Chiefs who it appeared had agreeably to their
promise exerted themselves in my favour, having no fresh meat and these poor
devils half starved I had previously prepared a good meal for them all of boiled corn
and beans which I gave them as soon as the council was over and I had distributed
the presents. this was thankfully received by them. the Cheif wished that his nation
could live in a country where they could provide such food. I told him that it would
not be many years before the whitemen would put it in the power of his nation to live
in the country below the mountains where they might cultivate corn beans and
squashes. he appeared much pleased with the information. I gave him a few dryed
squashes which we had brought from the Mandans he had them boiled and declared
them to be the best thing he had ever tasted except sugar, a small lump of which it
seems his sister Sah-cah-gar Wea had given him. late in the evening I made the men
form a bush drag, and with it in about 2 hours they caught 528 very good fish, most
of them large trout. among them I now for the first time saw ten or a douzen of a
white speceis of trout. they are of a silvery colour except on the back and head,
where they are of a bluish cast. the scales are much larger than the speckled trout,
but in their form position of their fins teeth mouth &c they are precisely like them.
they are not generally quite as large but equally well flavored. I distributed much the
greater portion of the fish among the Indians. I purchased five good horses of them
very reasonably, or at least for about the value of six dollars a peice in merchandize.
the Indians are very orderly and do not

Page 221
croud about our camp nor attempt to disterb any article they see lying about. They
borrow knives kettles &c from the men and always carefully return them.
[Clark] AUGUST 22D THURSDAY 1805.
We Set out early passed a Small Creek on the right at 1 mile and the points of four
mountains verry Steup high & rockey, the assent of three was So Steup that it is
incredeable to describe the rocks in maney places loose & Sliped from those
mountains and is a Solid bed of rugid loose white and dark brown loose rock for
miles. the Indian horses pass over those Clifts hills beds & rocks as fast as a man,
the three horses with me do not detain me any on account of those dificulties,
passed two bold rung. Streams on the right and a Small river at the mouth of which
Several families of Indians were encamped and had Several Scaffolds of fish & buries
drying2 we allarmed them verry much as they knew nothing of a white man being in
their Countrey, and at the time we approached their lodges which was in a thick
place of bushes my guides were behind. They offered every thing they possessed
(which was verry little) to us, Some run off and hid in the bushes The first offer of
theirs were Elks tushes from around their childrens necks, Sammon &c. my guide
attempted [to] passify those people and they Set before me berri[e]s, & fish to eate,
I gave a fiew Small articles to those fritened people which added verry much to their
pasification but not entirely as some of the women & Childn. Cried dureing my Stay
of an hour at this place, I proceeded on the Side of a verry Steep & rockey mountain
for 3 miles and Encamped on the lower pt. of an Island we attempted to gig fish
without Suckcess caught but one Small one. The last Creek or Small river is on the
right Side and a road passes up it & over to the Missouri (to Wisdom)3
2 Clark has been descending the main fork of the Salmon River. The "Small
river," which comes in from the north, is the North Fork of the Salmon, about
twenty-five miles north (downstream) of the town of Salmon, Idaho. Here the
river turns west and the going becomes increasingly difficult.
3 This trail would have led over the Divide by Gibbon's Pass.

Page 222
[Lewis] FRIDAY AUGUST 23RD 1805.
I wished to have set out this morning but the cheif requested that I would wait untill
another party of his nation arrived which he expected today, to this I consented from
necessity. I laid up the canoes this morning in a pond near the forks; sunk them in
the water and weighted them down with stone, after taking out the plugs of the gage
holes in their bottoms; hoping by this means to guard against both the effects of
high water, and that of the fire which is frequently kindled in these plains by the
natives. the Indians have promised to do them no intentional injury and [I] beleive
they are too laizy at any rate to give themselves the trouble to raise them from their
present situation in order to cut or birn them.
The metal which we found in possession of these people consited of a few indifferent
knives, a few brass kettles some arm bands of iron and brass, a few buttons, woarn
as ornaments in their hair, a spear or two of a foot in length and some iron and brass
arrow points which they informed me they obtained in exchange for horses from the
Crow or Rocky Mountain Indians on the yellow-stone River. the bridlebits and
stirreps they obtained from the Spaniards, tho these were but few. many of them
made use of flint for knives, and with this instrument, skined the animals they killed,
dressed their fish and made their arrows; in short they used it for every purpose to
which the knife is applyed. this flint is of no regular form, and if they can only obtain
a part of it, an inch or two in length that will cut they are satisfyed. they renew the
edge by flecking off the flint by means of the point of an Elk's or deer's horn. with the
point of a deer or Elk's horn they also form their arrow points of the flint, with a
quickness and neatness that is really astonishing. we found no axes nor hatchets
among them; what wood they cut was done either with stone or Elk's horn. the latter
they use always to rive or split their wood. their culinary eutensils exclusive of the
brass kettle before mentioned consist of pots in the form of a jar made either of
earth, or of a white soft stone which becomes black and very hard by birning, and is
found in the hills near the three forks of the Missouri between Madison's and Gallitin's
rivers. they have also spoons made of the Buffaloe's horn and those of the Bighorn.

Page 223
they sometimes make bows of the Elk's horn and those also of the bighorn. those of
the Elk's horn are made of a single peice and covered on the back with glue and
sinues like those made of wood, and are frequently ornamented with a stran[d]
wrought [of] porcupine quills and sinues raped around them for some distance at
both extremities. the bows of the bighorn are formed of small peices laid flat and
cemented with gleue, and rolled with siniws, after which, they are also covered on
the back with sinews and glew, and highly ornamented as they are much prized.
forming the sheild is a cerimony of great importance among them, this implement
would in their minds be devested of much of its protecting power were it not inspired
with those virtues by their older men and jugglers [medicine priests]. their method
of preparing it is thus, an entire skin of a bull buffaloe two years old is first provided;
a feast is next prepared and all the warriors old men and jugglers invited to partake.
a hole is sunk in the ground about the same in diameter with the intended sheild and
about 18 inches deep. a parcel of stones are now made red hot and thrown into the
hole water is next thrown in and the hot stones cause it to emit a very strong hot
steem, over this they spread the green skin which must not have been suffered to
dry after taken off the beast. the flesh side is laid next to the groround and as many
of the workmen as can reach it take hold on it's edges and extend it in every
direction. as the skin becomes heated, the hair seperates and is taken of with the
fingers, and the skin continues to contract untill the who[l]e is drawn within the
compas designed for the shield, it is then taken off and laid on a parchment hide
where they pound it with their heels when barefoot. this operation of pounding
continues for several days or as long as the feast lasts when it is delivered to the
propryeter and declared by the jugglers and old men to be a sufficient defence
against the arrows of their enimies or even bullets if feast has been a satisfactory
one. many of them beleive implisitly that a ball cannot penitrate their sheilds, in
consequence of certain superna[t]ural powers with which they have been inspired by
their jugglers.
The Poggamoggon * is an instrument with a handle of wood covered with dressed
leather about the size of a whip handle and 22 inches long; a round stone of 2
pounds weight is also covered with leather and strongly united to the leather of the
handle by a throng

Page 224
of 2 inches long; a loop of leather united to the handle passes around the wrist. a
very heavy blow may be given with this instrument. They have also a kind of armor
which they form with many foalds of dressed a[n]telope's skin, unite with glue and
sand. with this they cover their own bodies and those of their horses. these are
sufficient against the effects of the arrow. their impliments for making fire is nothing
more than a blunt arrow and a peice of well seasoned soft spongey wood such as the
willow or cottonwood. the point of this arrow they apply to this dry stick so near one
edge of it that the particles of wood which are seperated from it by the friction of the
arrow falls down by it's side in a little pile. the arrow is held between the palms of the
hand with the fingers extended, and being pressed as much as possible against the
peice is briskly rolled between the palms of the hands backwards and forwards by
pressing the arrow downwards the hands of course in rolling [the] arrow so decend;
they bring them back with a quick motion and repeat the operation till the dust by
the friction takes fire; the peice and arrow are then removed and some dry grass or
dooted [rotted] wood is added. in less than a minute they will produce fire.
[Clark] AUGUST 23RD FRIDAY 1805
proceed on with great dificuelty as the rocks were So sharp large and unsettled and
the hill sides Steep that the horses could with the greatest risque and dificulty get
on, at 4 miles we came to a place the horses Could not pass without going into the
river, we passed one mile to a very bad riffle the water confined in a narrow Channel
& beeting against the left Shore, as we have no parth further and the Mounts. jut So
close as to prevent the possibility of horses proceeding down, I Deturmined to delay
the party here and with my guide and three men proceed on down to examine if the
river continued bad or was practi[c]able, I set out with three men directing those left
to hunt and fish untill my return. I proceeded on. Sometimes in a Small wolf parth &
at other times Climing over the rocks for 12 miles to a large Creek on the right Side
above the mouth of this Creek for a Short distance is a narrow bottom & the first,
below the place I left my party. The River from the place I left my party to this Creek
is almost one

Page 225
continued rapid, five verry considerable rapids the passage of either with Canoes is
entirely impossible, as the water is Confined between huge Rocks & the Current
beeting from one against another for Some distance below &c. &c. at one of those
rapids the mountains close so Clost as to prevent a possibility of a portage with [out]
great labour in cutting down the Side of the hill removeing large rocks &c. &c. all the
others may be passed by takeing every thing over slipery rocks, and the Smaller
ones Passed by letting down the Canoes empty with Cords, as running them would
certainly be productive of the loss of Some Canoes, those dificulties and necessary
precautions would delay us an emence time in which provisions would be necessary.
below this Creek the lofty Pine is thick in the bottom hill Sides on the mountains & up
the runs. The river has much the resemblance of that above bends Shorter and no
passing after a few miles between the river & the mountains & the Current so Strong
that [it] is dangerous crossing the river, and to proceed down it would rend. it
necessary to Cross almost at every bend this river is about 100 yards wide and can
be forded but in a few places. below my guide and maney other Indians tell me that
the Mountains Close and is a perpendicular Clift on each Side, and Continues for a
great distance and that the water runs with great violence from one rock to the other
on each Side foaming & roreing thro rocks in every direction, So as to render the
passage of any thing impossible. those rapids which I had Seen he said was Small &
trifleing in comparrison to the rocks & rapids below, at no great distance & The Hills
or mountains were not like those I had Seen but like the Side of a tree Streight up.
we proceeded on a well beeten Indian parth up this creak (Berry Creek) about 6
miles and passed over a ridge 1 mile to the river in a Small vally through which we
passed and assended a Spur of the Mountain from which place my guide Shew[ed]
me the river for about 20 miles lower & pointed out the dificulties.
[Lewis] SATRDAY AUGUST 24TH 1805.
As the Indians who were on their way down the Missouri had a number of spare
ho[r]ses with them I thought it probable that I could obtain some of them and
therefore desired the Cheif to

Page 226
speak to them and inform me whether they would trade. they gave no positive
answer but requested to see the goods which I was willing to give in exchange. I
now produced some battle axes which I had made at Fort Mandan with which they
were much pleased. knives also seemed in great demand among them. I soon
purchased three horses and a mule. for each horse I gave an ax a knife handkercheif
and a little paint; & for the mule the addition of a knife a shirt handkercheif and a pair
of legings; at this price which was quite double that given for the horses, the fellow
who sold him made a merit of having bestoed [on] me one of his mules. I consider
this mule a great acquisition. these Indians soon told me that they had no more
horses for sale and I directed the party to prepare to set out. I had now nine horses
and a mule, and two which I had hired made twelve these I had loaded and the
Indian women took the ballance of the baggage. I had given the Interpreter some
articles with which to purchase a horse for the woman which he had obtained.
at twelve Oclock we set out and passed the river below the forks, directing our rout
towards the cove along the track formerly mentioned.4 most of the horses were
heavily laden, and it appears to me that it will require at least 25 horses to convey
our baggage along such roads as I expect we shall be obliged to pass in the
mountains. I had now the inexpressible satisfaction to find myself once more under
way with all my baggage and party. an Indian had the politeness to offer me one of
his horses to ride which I accepted with cheerfullness as it enabled me to attend
better to the march of the party. I had reached the lower part of the cove when an
Indian rode up and informed me that one of my men was very sick and unable to
come on. I directed the party to halt at a small run which falls into the creek on Lard.
at the lower part of the Cove and rode back about 2 Miles where I found Wiser very
ill with a fit of the cholic. I sent Sergt. Ordway who had remained with him for some
water and gave him a doze of the essence of Peppermint and laudinum which in the
course of half an hour so far recovered him that he was enabled to ride my horse
and I proceeded on foot and rejoined the party. the sun was yet an hour high
4 Lewis is beginning to transport the outfit across the Divide. His route will lead
from the mouth of Prairie Creek to Shoshone Cove, through Lemhi Pass. and
down to Lemhi River.

Page 227
but the Indians who had for some time impatiently waited my return at length
unloaded and turned out their horses and my party had followed there example. as it
was so late and the Indians had prepared their camp for the night I thought it best to
acquiess and determined also to remain. we had traveled only about six miles.
The few guns which the Shoshones have are reserved for war almost exclusively and
the bow and arrows are used in hunting. I have seen a few skins among these
people which have almost every appearance of the common sheep. they inform me
that they finde this animal on the high mountains to the West and S. W. of them. it is
about the size of the common sheep, the wool is reather shorter and more
intermixed with long hairs particularly on the upper part of the neck. these skins
have been so much woarn that I could not form a just Idea of the animal or it's
colour. the Indians however inform me that it is white and that it's horns are lunated
comprest twisted and bent backward as those of the common sheep.5 the texture of
the skin appears to be that of the sheep. I am now perfectly convinced that the
sheep as well as the Bighorn exist in these mountains.
[Clark] AUGUST 24TH SATTURDAY 1805
I wrote a letter to Capt Lewis informing him of the prospects before us and
information rec[ei]ved of my guide which I thought favourable &c. & Stating two
plans one of which for us to pursue &c. and despatched one man & horse and
directed the party to get ready to march back, every man appeared disheartened
from the prospects of the river, and nothing to eate, I Set out late and Camped 2
miles above, nothing to eate but Choke Cherries & red haws, which act in different
ways So as to make us Sick, dew verr heavy, my beding wet in passing around a
rock the horses were obliged to go deep into the water.
The plan I stated to Capt Lewis if he agrees with me we shall adopt it. to procure as
many horses (one for each man) if possible and to hire my present guide who I sent
on to him to interigate thro' the Intptr. and proceed on by land to Some navagable

[Lewis] SUNDAY AUGUST 25TH 1805.
This morning loaded our horses and set out a little after sunrise; a few only of the
Indians unengaged in assisting us went on as I had yesterday proposed to the cheif.
the others flanked us on each side and started some Antelope which they pursued
for several hours but killed none of them. we proceeded within 2 Ms. of the narrow
pass or seven miles from our camp of last evening and halted for dinner. Our hunters
joined us at noon with three deer the greater part of which I gave the indians.
sometime after we had halted, Charbono mentioned to me with apparent unconcern
that he expected to meet all the Indians from the camp on the Columbia tomorrow
on their way to the Missouri. allarmed at this information I asked why he expected to
meet them. he then informed me that the 1st Chief had dispatched some of his
young men this morning to this camp requesting the Indians to meet tomorrow and
that himself and those with him would go on with them down the Missouri, and
consequently leave me and my baggage on the mountain or thereabouts. I was out
of patience with the folly of Charbono who had not sufficient sagacity to see the
consequencies which would inevitably flow from such a movement of the indians,
and altho' he had been in possession of this information since early in the morning
when it had been communicated to him by his Indian woman yet he never mentioned
it untill the after noon. I could not forbear speaking to him with some degree of
asperity on this occasion. I saw that there was no time to be lost in having those
orders countermanded, or that we should not in all probability obtain any more
horses or even get my baggage to the waters of the Columbia.
I therefore Called the three Cheifs together and having smoked a pipe with them, I
asked them if they were men of their words and whether I could depent on the
promises they had made me;

Page 229
they readily answered in the affermative; I then asked them if they had not promised
to assist me with my baggage to their camp on the other side of the mountains, or to
the place at which Capt. Clark might build the canoes, should I wish it. they
acknowledged that they had. I then asked them why they had requested their people
on the other side of the mountain to meet them tomorrow on the mountain where
there would be no possibility of our remaining together for the purpose of trading for
their horses as they had also promised. that if they had not promised to have given
me their assistance in transporting my baggage to the waters on the other side of
the mountain that I should not have attempted to pass the mountains but would
have returned down the river and that in that case they would never have seen
anymore white men in their country. that if they wished the white men to be their
friends and to assist them against their enemies by furnishing them with arms and
keeping their enemies from attacking them that they must never promis us anything
which they did not mean to perform. that when I had first seen them they had
doubted what I told them about the arrival of the party of whitemen in canoes, that
they had been convinced that what I told them on that occasion was true, why then
would they doubt what I said on any other point. I told them that they had witnessed
my liberality in dividing the meat which my hunters killed with them; and that I
should continue to give such of them as assisted me a part of whatever we had
ourselves to eat. and finally concluded by telling them if they intended to keep the
promises they had made me to dispatch one of their young men immediately with
orders to their people to remain where they were untill our arrival.
the two inferior cheifs said that they wished to assist me and be as good as their
word, and that they had not sent for their people, that it was the first Cheif who had
done so, and they did not approve of the measure. Cameahwait remained silent for
some time, at length he told me that he knew he had done wrong but that he had
been induced to that measure from seeing all his people hungry, but as he had
promised to give me his assistance he would not in future be worse than his word. I
then desired him to send immediately and countermand his orders; accordingly a
young man was sent for this purpose and I gave him a handkerchief to engage him
in my interest.

Page 230
MONDAY AUGUST 26TH 1805.
we collected our horses and set out at sunrise. we soon arrived at the extreem
source of the Missouri; here I halted a few minutes, the men drank of the water and
consoled themselves with the idea of having at length arrived at this long wished for
point. from hence we proceeded to a fine spring on the side of the mountain where I
had lain the evening before I first arrived at the Shoshone Camp. here I halted to
dine and graize our horses, there being fine green grass on that part of the hillside
which was moistened by the water of the spring while the grass on the other parts
was perfectly dry and parched with the sun. I directed a pint of corn to be given each
Indian who was engaged in transporting our baggage and about the same quantity
to each of the men which they parched pounded and made into supe. one of the
women who had been assisting in the transportation of the baggage halted at a little
run about a mile behind us, and sent on the two pack horses which she had been
conducting by one of her female friends. I enquired of Cameahwait the cause of her
detention, and was informed by him in an unconcerned manner that she had halted
to bring fourth a child and would soon overtake us; in about an hour the woman
arrived with her newborn babe and passed us on her way to the camp apparently as
well as she ever was. It appears to me that the facility and ease with which the
women of the aborigines of North America bring fourth their children is reather a gift
of nature than depending as some have supposed on the habitude of carrying heavy
burthens on their backs while in a state of pregnacy.
Cameahwait requested that we would discharge our guns when we arrived in sight of
the Village, accordingly when I arrived on an eminence above the village in the plain I
drew up the party at open order in a single rank and gave them a runing fire
discharging two rounds. they appeared much gratifyed with this exhibition. we then
proceeded to the village or encampment of brush lodges 32 in number. we were
conducted to a large lodge which had been prepared for me in the center of their
encampment which was situated in a beautifull level smooth and extensive bottom
near the river about 3 miles above the place I had first found them encamped. here
we arrived at 6 in the evening arranged our baggage

Page 231
near my tent and placed those of the men on either side of the baggage facing
outwards. I found Colter here who had just arrived with a letter from Capt. Clark in
which Capt. C.. had given me an account of his perigrination and the description of
the river and country as before detailed from this view of the subject I found it a folly
to think of attemp[t]ing to decend this river in canoes and therefore determined to
commence the purchase of horses in the morning from the indians in order to carry
into execution the design we had formed of passing the rocky Mountains. I now
informed Cameahwait of my intended expedition overland to the great river which lay
in the plains beyond the mountains and told him that I wished to purchase 20 horses
of himself and his people to convey our baggage. he observed that the Minnetares
had stolen a great number of their horses this spring but hoped his people would
spear me the number I wished. I also asked a (another) guide, he observed that he
had no doubt but the old man who was with Capt. C. would accompany us if we
wished him and that he was better informed of the country than any of them.
matters being thus far arranged I directed the fiddle to be played and the party
danced very merily much to the amusement and gratification of the natives, though I
must confess that the state of my own mind at this moment did not well accord with
the prevailing mirth as I somewhat feared that the caprice of the indians might
suddenly induce them to withhold their horses from us without which my hopes of
prosicuting my voyage to advantage was lost.

Down the Lolo Trail
The party moved down the small Lemhi River to the main fork of the Salmon River
and about ten miles down that to the mouth of Tower Creek, some fifteen miles
above the mouth of the North Fork of the Salmon. It turned up the precipitous
canyon of the North Fork, heading northeast toward the (Bitterroot) valley where it
would find the trail by which, as both captains had been told, the Nez Percés
crossed the mountains to the buffalo plains. Some of the Shoshones accompanied
the party for a while but by September 1 all had turned back except ''Toby,'' the old
man who had been hired as a guide, and his son. They had been able to buy 29
horses, for packing and, as Clark added, to "Eate if necessary."
[Clark] SEPTEMBER 2ND MONDAY 1805
we Set out early and proceeded on up the Creek,1 Crossed a large fork from the
right and one from the left; and at 8 miles left the roade on which we were pursuing
and which leads over to the Missouri, and proceeded up a West fork without a roade
proceded on thro' thickets in which we were obliged to Cut a road, over rockey hill
Sides where our horses were in [per]peteal danger of Slipping to their certain
distruction & up & Down Steep hills, where Several horses fell, Some turned over,
and others Sliped down Steep hill Sides, one horse Crippeled & 2 gave out. with the

met with a great misfortune, in haveing our last Th[er]mometer broken, by accident
This day we passed over emence hils and Some of the worst roads that ever horses
passed, our horses frequently fell Snow about 2 inches deep when it began to rain
which termonated in a Sleet[storm]
SEPTEMBER 4TH WEDNESDAY 1805
Groun[d] covered with Snow, we assended a mountain & took a Divideing ridge2
which we kept for Several Miles & fell on the head of a Creek which appeared to run
the Course we wished to go, prosued our Course down the Creek to the forks about
5 miles where we met a part[y] of the Tushepau [Flathead] nation, of 33 Lodges
about 80 men 400 Total and at least 500 horses, those people rec[e]ved us friendly,

3 See footnote, p. 52, entry for October 18, 1804. A belief that there was a
tribe of Welsh Indians was the most widespread and most durable myth in
American history in fact, it reappears occasionally even today. It made its first
printed appearance in 1583. It has many variants but the basic story relates
that in A.D. 1170 a Welsh prince named Madoc sailed across the Atlantic and
discovered America. He returned to Wales, raised a large company for
colonitation, and planted them in the New World. The descendants of this
colony lived on somewhere in the western wilderness. They had white skins
and spoke Welsh. Some variants of the myth held that they were otherwise
indistinguishable from other Indians. Other versions, however, asserted that
they maintained their European culture intact. The myth is discussed in
DeVoto, The Course of Empire, Chap. II. See also Chaps. IX, XI, and XII.

however, says it was Camp Creek and Thwaites concurs.

the country in the valley of this river is generally a prarie and from five to 6 miles
wide. at 12 we halted on a small branch which falls into the river on the E. side,
where we breakfasted on a scant proportion of meat which we had reserved from the
hunt of yesterday added to three geese which one of our hunters killed this morning.
we continued our rout down the valley about 4 miles and crossed the river; it is hear
a handsome stream about 100 yards wide and affords a considerable quantity of
very clear water, the banks are low and it's bed entirely gravel.5 the stream appears
navigable, but from the circumstance of their being no sammon in it I believe that
there must be a considerable fall in it below. our guide could not inform us where
this river discharged itself into the columbia river, he informed us that it continues
it's course along the mountains to the N. as far as he knew it and that not very
distant from where we then were it formed a junction with a stream nearly as large
as itself which took it's rise in the mountains near the Missouri to the East of us and
passed through an extensive valley generally open prarie which forms an excellent
pass to the Missouri. the point of the Missouri where this Indian pass intersects it, is
about 30 miles above the gates of the rocky Mountain, or the place where the valley
of the Missouri first widens into an extensive plain after entering the rockey
Mountains. the guide
5 They are now in Bitterroot Valley, traveling down the Bitterroot River, which
they had first called Clark's River and later the Flathead. (It must not be
confused with the Flathead River of today.) Observe that they now receive
unmistakable information about a route west to the Bitterroot Valley from the
Gate of the Mountains. The informant says this route requires four days; they
themselves had required 52 days to get here by the route they had taken from
the Gate of the Mountains. The camp which they call Traveller's Rest was at
the mouth of Lolo Creek.

Page 236
informed us that a man might pass to the missouri from hence by that rout in four
days. we continued our rout down the W. side of the river about 5 miles further and
encamped on a large creek which falls in on the West. as our guide inform me that
we should leave the river at this place and the weather appearing settled and fair I
determined to halt the next day rest our horses and take som scelestial
Observations. we called this Creek Travellers rest.
TUESDAY SEPTEMBER 10TH 1805
The morning being fair I sent out all the hunters, and directed two of them to
procede down the river as far as it's junction with the Eastern fork which heads near
the missouri,6 and return this evening. this fork of the river we determined to name
the Valley plain river. (we called the Eastern fork of Clarkes river.) I think it most
probable that this river continues it's course along the rocky Mts. Northwardly as far
or perhaps beyond the scources of Medecine river and then turning to the West falls
into the Tacootchetessee.7 The Minetares informed us that there wass a large river
west of, and at no great distance from the sources of Medicine river, which passed
along the Rocky Mountains from S. to N. this evening one of our hunters returned
accompanyed by three men of the Flathead nation whom he had met in his excurtion
up travellers rest Creek. on first meeting him the Indians were alarmed and prepared
for battle with their bows and arrows, but he soon relieved their fears by laying down
his gun and advancing towards them. the Indians were mounted on very fine horses
of which the Flatheads have a great abundance; that is, each man in the nation
possesses from 20 to a hundred head. our guide could not speake the language of
these people but soon engaged them in conversation by signs or jesticulation, the
common language of all the Aborigines of North America, it is one understood by all
of them and appears to be sufficiently copious to convey with a degree of certainty
the outlines of what they wish to communicate. in this
6 Officially Clark's Fork and spelled Clarksfork, this is the river locally called the
Missoula and, in its upper stretches, the Hellgate and the Blackfoot. The
Bitterroot flows into it at Missoula, Montana.
7 Lewis takes this name from Alexander Mackenzie's map, supposing it to be the
Columbia River in its upper reaches, as Mackenzie did when he tried but failed to
follow it to the sea in 1793. Actually it was the Fraser River.

manner we learnt from these people that two men which they supposed to be of the
Snake nation had stolen 23 horses from them and that they were in pursuit of the
theaves. they told us they were in great hast, we gave them some boiled venison, of
which the[y] eat sparingly. the sun was now set, two of them departed after
receiving a few small articles which we gave them, and the third remained having
agreed to continue with us as a guide, and to introduce us to his relations whom he
informed us were numerous and resided in the plain below the mountains on the
columbia river, from whence he said the water was good and capable of being
navigated to the sea; that some of his relation[s] were at the sea last fall and saw an
old whiteman who resided there by himself and who had given them some
handkerchiefs such as he saw in our possession. he said it would require five sleeps

its elevation was more than 7000 feet and it frequently approximates that height,

I saw 4 Deer to day and what is singular Snaped 7 times at a large buck. it is
singular as my gun has a Steel fuzee and never Snaped 7 times before, in examining
her found the flint loose. to describe the road of this day would be a repitition of
yesterday except the Snow which made it much worse
The high mountains required only one more day. The country into which the
expedition emerged remained difficult, however. There were lesser peaks and
ridges, high hills, heavy timber. Except for a few "pheasants" (grouse) there was no
game. On September 18 Clark pushed ahead with six hunters. On the 19th his group
met a stray horse, killed and butchered it, and after breakfasting on it hung the rest
on a tree for the main party. Its presence meant that there were Indians in the
vicinity and on the 20th he met two small wandering villages of them. They were
Nez Percés (pronounced "nezz purses") and though he could talk with them only in
sign language they proved friendly and hospitable. They supplied his advance party
with their two staples, dried salmon and flour made from the camass (Camassia
quamash) root. He attributed his illness that night to overeating, but that it was due
to some other cause was promptly established by the experience of the main party.
Buying a pack load of salmon and cams, he sent Reuben Fields with it to Lewis.
Then he continued on to lower country along the Clearwater, to a large village of
Nez Percés presided over by the chief whose name they rendered Twisted Hair and
with whom they developed a strong friendship.

Page 241
Meanwhile short rations were undermining the strength and to some extent the
morale of the main party under Lewis. They eked out their small stock of horse meat
with some "portable soup" (an army experimental iron ration which nobody liked),
an occasional grouse, a coyote, and even a crow. When they caught up with Clark,
at a neighboring village, some of them were sick and nearly everyone soon became
so.
The trouble was dysentery, in Clark's words a universal "Lax & heaviness at the
stomack." It may have been due to bacteria in the dried salmon but the Nez Percés
did not suffer from it and since they could hardly have developed immunity to
amoebic dysentery, probably the camass was responsible. They had changed from
an exclusively meat diet to a cereal one, after being to some extent weakened by a
period of cold following the intense heat of the plains. As they move down to the
forks of the Clearwater River, accompanied by the Nez Percés, Clark's journal is
practically a hospital daybook. "Capt. Lewis scercely able to ride on a jentle horse
which was furnished by the Chief, Several men So unwell that they were Compelled
to lie on the Side of the road [trail] for Some time others obliged to be put on
horses. . . . 3 parts of Party sick Capt. Lewis verry sick. . . . most of the Party
Complaining. . . . I am a little unwell . . . Several taken Sick at work . . . Drewyer
sick . . . Our men nearly all Complaining of their bowels." Clark attacked the illness
forthrightly with "Rush's pills," a powerful charge consisting of ten grains of calomel
and ten grains of jalap. It was not powerful enough to satisfy him and he
supplemented with large doses of Glauber's salts and of emetics.
The Nez Percés navigated the Clearwater in dugouts. Obviously the expedition could
resume water travel. They moved down to the forks and began to make dugouts
from large pines, probably the Ponderosa or Western yellow pine, "burning out the
holler of our canoes."
They continued to get information about the route ahead, and less dependable
information about the country that lay to the south and southwest.

sufficiently dried to pack up obliged us to delay another night dureing the time one
man was tradeing for fish for our voyage, at Dark we were informed that our old
guide13 & his son had left us and had been Seen running up the river Several miles
above, we could not account for the cause of his leaveing us at this time, without
receiving his pay for the services he had rendered us, or letting us know anything of
his intention.
we requested the Chief14 to Send a horseman after our old guide to come back and
receive his pay &c. which he advised us not to do as his nation would take his things

[Clark] OCTOBER 10TH WEDNESDAY (THURSDAY)
at 8 1\2 miles lower we arrived at the heade of a verry bad riffle at which place we
landed near 8 lodges of Indians [Nez Percés] on the Lard Side to view the riffle,
haveing passed two Isalnds & Six rapids Several of them verry bad after viewg. this
riffle two Canoes were taken over verry well; the third stuck on a rock which took us
an hour to get her off which was effected without her receving a greater injurey than
a Small Split in her Side which was repaired in a Short time, we purchased fish &
dogs of those people, dined and proceeded on. here we met with an Indian from the
falls at which place he Sais he saw white people, and expressd an inclination to
accompany us, we passd. a few miles above this riffle 2 Lodges and an Indian
batheing in a hot bath made by hot stones thrown into a pon[d] of water. at five
miles lower and Sixty miles below the forks arived at a large southerly fork which is
the one we were on with the Snake or So-So-nee nation.15 This
15 A remarkable example of geographical intelligence. Clark understands at
once that they have again reached the watershed which they first touched at
the Lemhi, and have reached it downstream from the junction of Lewis's River
with its large southern fork, of whose existence they had learned from the
Snakes. That is basically correct. The "southern fork" was in fact the main
stream of the Snake River, and the stream whose precipitous canyons turned
them back was its principal tributary, the Salmon River. The Salmon flows into
the Snake 50 miles above the mouth of the Clearwater

make those returns on their part.17
17 This seems an unjust stricture, considering the hospitality with which the
Nez Percés had received them, and eventually both captains were to consider
them the most generous and most likable tribe they had met.

Chapter XVIII
The Rapids of the Snake and Columbia
The Snake is a big river and from the mouth of the Clear-water most of the way to
the Columbia it flows through a series of canyons. The party reached it in the
season of low water, which meant that the rapids were at their least dangerous.
Even so, "we should make more portages," Clark writes, "if the season was not so
far advanced and time precious with us."
Twisted Hair and Tetoharsky continued as guides, and a small, chattering, and daily
changing group of Nez Percés from the Clear-water region moved companionably
along the banks, afoot or on horseback. These and local groups, still of either the
Nez Percés or the Flathead families, helped or actually piloted them through the
rapids. Even so, on October 14, one dugout (in charge of Drewyer) struck a rock
and overturned. Some of the small and diminished stock of trade goods sank
beyond recovery, a serious loss since this was the currency that paid for food, labor,
information, and the services of the trail. The rest of the lading suffered only a
wetting. On the 16th Pryor's dugout grounded in still more violent water and its
cargo was thoroughly drenched. No one was drowned in this turbulent stretch,
although some of the party could not swim.
Everywhere the party saw evidence of the salmon economy, around which the life of
these river tribes was organized: weirs, spears, nets (made of fiber), caches of dried
fish, etc. Everybody was heartily bored by living on fish; on October 14 Clark wrote,
"for the first time for three weeks past I had a good dinner of Blue wing Teel." There
were a lot of Indians but they remained amiable; Clark attributed their friendliness
to the presence of Sacajawea, which "we find reconsiles all the Indians as to our
friendly

Page 250
intentions a woman with a party of men is a token of peace."
There was little game and less firewood. They were obliged to buy wood from the
Indians. They left the canyons but not the rapids behind, coming out to a wide
sagebrush plain. Considering that the Columbia was the great objective of their
journey, the log records very little emotion when they reach it on October 16, the
first white men who ever saw it east of the Cascade Mountains.
[Clark] OCTOBER 16TH WEDNESDAY 1805
A cool morning, deturmined to run the rapids, put our Indian guide in front our Small
Canoe next and the other four following each other, the canoes all passed over Safe
except the rear Canoe which run fast on a rock at the lower part of the Rapids, with
the early assistance of the other Canoes & the Indians, who was extreamly ellert
every thing was taken out and the Canoe got off without any enjorie further than the
articles [with] which it was loaded [getting] all wet. at 14 miles passed a bad rapid at
which place we unloaded and made a portage of 3\4 of a mile haveing passd 4
Smaller rapids, three Islands and the parts of a house above, I Saw Indians & Horses
on the South Side below five Indians came up the river in great haste, we Smoked
with them and gave them a piece of tobacco to Smoke with their people and sent
them back, they Set out in a run & continued to go as fast as they could run as far as
we could see them. after getting Safely over the rapid and haveing taken Diner Set
out and proceeded on Seven miles to the junction of this river and the Columbia
which joins from the N. W. In every direction from the junction of those rivers the
countrey is one continued plain low and rises from the water gradually, except a
range of high Countrey on the opposit Side about 2 miles distant from the Collumbia.
We halted above the point on the river Kimooenim1 to smoke with the Indians who
had collected there in great numbers to view us, here we met our 2 Chiefs who left
us two days ago and proceeded on to this place to inform those bands of our
approach and friendly intentions towards all nations &c. we also met the 2 men who
had passed us Several days ago on horsback, one of
1 The Snake.

Page 251
them we observed was a man of great influence with those Indians, harranged them;
after Smokeing with the Indians who had collected to view us we formed a camp at
the point near which place I saw a fiew pieces of Drift wood after we had our camp
fixed and fires made, a Chief came from this camp which was about 1/4 of a mile up
the Columbia river at the head of about 200 men signing and beeting on their drums
Stick and keeping time to the musik they formed a half circle around us and Sung for
Some time, we gave them all Smoke, and Spoke to their Chief as well as we could by
signs informing them of our friendly disposition to all nations, and our joy in Seeing
those of our Children around us, Gave the principal chief a large Medal, Shirt and
Handkf. a 2nd Chief a Meadel of Small size, and to the Cheif who came down from
the upper villages a Small Medal & Handkerchief.
The Chiefs then returned with the men to their camp; Soon after we purchased for
our Provisions Seven Dogs, Some fiew of those people made us presents of fish and
Several returned and delayed with us until bedtime. The 2 old chiefs who
accompanied us from the head of the river precured us Some fuil Such as the Stalks
of weed[s] or plant[s] and willow bushes. one man made me a present of about 20
lb. of verry fat Dried horse meat.
OCTOBER 17TH THURSDAY 1805
Several men and woman offered Dogs and fish to Sell, we purchased all the dogs we
could, the fish being out of season and dieing in great numbers in the river, we did
not think proper to use them, send out Hunters to shute the Prarie Cock a large fowl
which I have only Seen on this river, Capt. Lewis took a Vocabelary of the Language
of those people who call themselves Sokulk,2 and also one of the language of a
nation resideing on a Westerly fork of the Columbia which mouthes a fiew miles
above this place who Call themselves Chim-nâ-pum Some fiew of this nation reside
with the Sokulks nation.
I took two men in a Small canoe and assended the Columbia river 10 miles to an
Island near the Stard. Shore on which two
2 Closely related to the Nez Percés, as their language shows, they were
probably Yakimas.

Page 252
large Mat Lodges of Indians were drying Salmon, The number of dead Salmon on the
Shores & floating in the river is incrediable to say and at this Season they have only
to collect the fish Split them open and dry them on their Scaffolds on which they
have great numbers, how far they have to raft their timber they make their scaffolds
of I could not lern; but there is no timber of any sort except Small willow bushes in
sight in any direction. from this Island the natives showed me the enterance of a
large Westerly fork which they Call Tâpetêtt at about 8 miles distant, the evening
being late I deturmined to return to the forks, at which place I reached at Dark.
passed a Island in the middle of the river at 5 miles at the head of which is a rapid,
not dangerous on the Lard. Side opposit ot this rapid is a fishing place 3 Mat Lodges,
and great quants. of Salmon on scaffolds drying. Saw great numbers of Dead
Salmon on the Shores and floating in the water, great numbers of Indians on the
banks viewing me and 18 canoes accompanied me from the point. The waters of this
river is clear, and a Salmon may be seen at the deabth of 15 or 20 feet. West 4 miles
to the lower point of a large Island near the Stard. Side at 2 Lodges, passed three
large lodges on the Star. Side near which great number of Salmon was drying on
scaffolds one of those Mat lodges I entered found it crouded with men women and
children and near the enterance of those houses I saw maney squars engaged [in]
splitting and drying Salmon. I was furnished with a mat to set on, and one man set
about preparing me something to eate, first he brought in a piece of a Drift log of
pine and with a wedge of the elks horn, and a malet of Stone curioesly carved he
Split the log into Small pieces and lay'd it open on the fire on which he put round
Stones, a woman handed him a basket of water and a large Salmon about half Dried,
when the Stones were hot he put them into the basket of water with the fish which
was soon sufficiently boiled for use it was then taken out put on a platter of rushes
neetly made, and set before me they boiled a Salmon for each of the men with me,
dureing those preparations, I smoked, with those about me who chose to smoke
which was but fiew, this being a custom those people are but little accustomed to
and only Smok thro: form. after eateing the boiled fish which was delicious, I set out
& halted or come too on the Island at the two Lodges, Several fish was given to me,
in return

Page 253
for Which I gave Small pieces of ribbond on my return found Great numbs. of the
nativs with Capt. Lewis, men all employ[e]d in dressing ther skins mending their
clothes and putting their arms in the best order the latter being always a matter of
attention with us. The Dress of those natives differ but little from those on the
Koskoskia and Lewis's rivers, except the women who dress verry different, in as
much as those above ware long leather Shirts which [are] highly ornimented with
beeds shells &c. &c. and those on the main Columbia river only ware a truss or pece
of leather tied around them at their hips and drawn tite between their legs and
fastened before So as bar[e]ly to hide those parts which are so sacredly hid &
s[e]cured by our women. Those women are more inclined to Co[r]pulency than any
we have yet Seen, their eyes are of a Duskey black, their hair of a corse black
without orniments of any kind braded as above
Those people appears to live in a State of comparitive happiness: they take a
great[er] share [in the] labor of the woman, than is common among Savage tribes,
and as I am informed [are] content with one wife Those people respect the aged
with Veneration. I observed an old woman in one of the Lodges which I entered, She
was entirely blind as I was informed by signs, had lived more than 100 winters, She
occupied the best position in the house, and when She Spoke great attention was
paid to what she Said. Those people as also those of the flat heads which we had
passed on the Koskoske and Lewis's rivers are subject to sore eyes, and many are
blind of one and Some of both eyes. this misfortune must be owing to the reflections
of the sun &c. on the waters in which they are continually fishing during the Spring
Summer & fall, & the snows dureing the winter Seasons, in this open country where
the eye has no rest. I have observed amongst those, as well in all other tribes which
I have passed on these waters who live on fish maney of different sectes who have
lost their teeth about middle age, Some have their teeth worn to the gums,
perticelar[ly] those of the upper jaw, and the tribes generally have bad teeth
The Houses or Lodges of the tribes of the main Columbia river is of large Mats made
of rushes,3 those houses are from 15 to 60
3 The skin tipi has been left behind and so has practically all the rest of the
Plains culture, except that some of these people have horses. The culture of
these river Indians is basically that of the Northwest coast tribes.

in[n]er Side, Six feet high, the top is covered also with mats leaveing a Seperation in
the whole length of about 12 or 15 inches wide, left for the purpose of admitting light
and for the Smok of the fire to pass which is made in the middle of the house.
Those people appeare of a mild disposition and friendly disposed. They have in their
huts independant of their nets gigs & fishing tackling each bows & large quivers or
arrows on which they use flint Spikes.
OCTOBER 18TH FRIDAY 1805
The fish being very bad those which was offered to us we had every reason to
believe was taken up on the shore dead we thought proper not to purchase any, we
purchased forty dogs for which we gave articles of little value, such as beeds, bells &
thimbles, of which they appeared verry fond, at 4 oClock we set out down the Great
Columbia accompanied by our two old Chiefs, one young man wished to accompany
us, but we had no room for more, & he could be of no service to us.
we landed a few minits to view a rapid, passd. this rapid which was verry bad,
between 2 Small Islands, two Still Smaller near the Lard. Side, at this rapid on the
Stard. Side is 2 Lodges of Indians Drying fish, at 2 1/2 miles lower passed an Island
Close under the Stard. Side on which was 2 Lodges of Indians drying fish on
Scaffolds at 16 miles the river passes into the range of high Countrey, at which place
the rocks project into the river from the high clifts which is on the Lard. Side about
1/3 of the way across and those of the Stard. Side about the same distance, the
countrey rises here about 200 feet above the water and is bordered with black rugid
rocks, at the Commencement of this high countrey on Lard. Side a Small riverlet falls
in which appears to [have] passed under the high county. in its whole co[ur]se. saw
a mountain bearing S. W. conocal form Covered with Snow.4 passed 4 Islands, at
4 The ''riverlet'' is the Walla Walla River. Just beyond it the Columbia bends
sharply to the east and, a mighty and uproarious river, enters the first of the
long series of canyons and gorges from which it does not emerge till it hurtles
through the Cascade Mountains. The conical mountain, which Clark does not
identify from his maps, is Mount Hood. In this stretch of the river it is only
occasionally visible.

Page 255
the upper point of the 3rd is a rapid, on this Island is two Lodges of Indians, drying
fish, on the fourth Island close under the Stard. Side is nine large Lodges of Indians
Drying fish on scaffolds as above at this place we were called to to land, as it was
near night, and no appearance of wood, we proceeded on about 2 miles lower to
Some Willows, at which place we observed a drift log formed a camp on the Lard.
Side under a high hill nearly opposit to five Lodges of Indians;
OCTOBER 19TH SATURDAY 1805
The great chief Yel-lep-pit two other chiefs, and a chief of [a] Band below presented
themselves to us verry early this morning. Yelleppit is a bold handsom Indian, with a
dignified countenance about 35 years of age, about 5 feet 8 inches high and well
perpotiond. he requested us to delay untill the Middle of the day, that his people
might come down and see us, we excused our Selves and promised to stay with him
one or 2 days on our return which appeared to Satisfy him; great numbers of Indians
came down in Canoes to view us before we Set out which was not untill 9 oClock A.
M. we proceeded on passed a Island, close under the Lard. Side about six miles in
length about four miles below this Island we arrived at the head of a verry bad
rapid,5 we came too on the Lard. Side to view the rapid before we would venter to
run it, as the Chanel appeared to be close under the oppd. Shore, and it would be
necessary to liten our canoe, I deturmined to walk down on the Lard. Side, with the
2 chiefs the interpreter & his woman, and derected the Small canoe to pr[o]cede
down on the Lard. Side to the foot of the rapid which was about 2 miles in length I
assended a high clift about 200 feet above the water; from this place I descovered a
high mountain of emence hight covered with Snow, this must be one of the
mountains laid down by Vancouver, as seen from the mouth of the Columbia River,
from the course which it bears which is West I take it to be Mt. St. Helens, destant
about 120 miles a range of mountains in the Derection crossing a conical mountain
S. W. toped with snow,6 I delayed at the foot of the rapid about 2 hours for the
5 Near the mouth of the Umatilla River.
6 Mount St. Helens, the perfect cone, would not be visible from where Clark was.
Wheeler identifies this as Mount Adams.

Page 256
canoes which I could see met with much dificuelty in passing down the rapid on the
opposit Side maney places the men were obliged to get into the water and haul the
canoes over sholes I observed a great number of Lodges on the opposit Side at
some distance below, and Several Indians on the opposit bank passing up to where
Capt. Lewis was with the Canoes, others I saw on a knob nearly opposit to me at
which place they delayed but a Short time, before they returned to their Lodges as
fast as they could run,
I was fearfull that those people might not be informed of us, I deturmined to take the
little canoe which was with me and proceed with the three men in it to the Lodges,
on my aproach not one person was to be seen except three men off in the plains,
and they sheared off as I saw approached near the Shore, I landed in front of five
Lodges which was at no great distance from each other, Saw no person the
enterance or Dores of the Lodges wer Shut with the Same materials of which they
were built a Mat, I approached one with a pipe in my hand entered a lodge which
was the nearest to me found 32 persons men, women and a few children Setting
permiscuisly in the Lodge, in the greatest agutation, Some crying and ringing there
hands, others hanging their heads. I gave my hand to them all and made Signs of
my friendly dispo[si]tion and offered the men my pipe to Smok and distributed a fiew
Small articles which I had in my pockets, this measure passified those distressed
people verry much, I then sent one man into each lodge and entered a Second
myself the inhabitants of which I found more fritened than those of the first lodge I
destributed Sundrey Small articles amongst them, and Smoked with the men, I then
Set my self on a rock and made signs to the men to come and Smoke with me not
one come out untill the canoes arrived with the 2 chiefs, one of whom spoke aloud,
and as was their custom to all we had passed. the Indians came out & Set by me and
smoked They said we came from the clouds &c. &c. and were not men &c. &c. this
time Capt. Lewis came down with the canoes in which the Indian[s were], as Soon
as they Saw the Squar wife of the interperter they pointed to her and informed those
who continued yet in the Same position I first found them, they imediately all came
out and appeared to assume new life, the sight of This Indian woman, wife to one of
our interprs. confirmed those people

Page 257
of our friendly intentions, as no woman ever accompanies a war party of Indians in
this quarter. Dined, and proceeded on passed a Small rapid and 15 Lodges below the
five, and Encamped below an Island close under the Lard. Side, nearly opposit to 24
Lodges on an Island near the middle of the river, and the Main Stard. Shore. Soon
after we landed which was at a fiew willow trees about 100 Indians came from the
different Lodges, and a number of them brought wood which they gave us, we
Smoked with all of them, and two of our Party Peter Crusat & Gibson played on the
violin which delighted them greatly, their Dress are Similar to those at the fork
except their robes are smaller and do not reach lower than the waste 3/4 of them
have scercely any robes at all, the women have only a Small pece of a robe which
covers their Sholders neck and reaching down behind to their wastes, with a tite
piece of leather about the waste, the brests are large and hang down verry low illy
Shaped, high Cheeks flattened heads, & have but fiew orniments.
OCTOBER 20TH SUNDAY 1805
we Set out leaveing about 200 of the nativs at our Encampment, passed a rapid at
seven miles one at a Short distance below we passed a verry bad rapid, a chane of
rocks makeing from the Stard. Side and nearly chokeing the river up entirely with
hugh black rocks, an Island below close under the Stard. Side on which was four
Lodges of Indians drying fish, here I saw a great number of Pelicons on the wing,
and black Comerants. at one oClock we landed on the lower point of an Island, on
the upper part of this Island we discovered an Indian Vault, our curiosity induced us
to examine the method those nativs practiced in depos[it]eing the dead, the vau[l]t
was made by broad poads [boards] and pieces of Canoes leaning on a ridge pole
which was Suported by 2 forks Set in the ground six feet in hight in an easterly and
westerly direction and about 60 feet in length, and 12 feet wide, in it I observed
great numbers of humane bones of every description perticularly in a pile near the
center of the vault, on the East End 21 Scul bomes forming a circle on Mats; in the
westerley part of the Vault appeared to be appropriated for those of more resent
death, as many of the bodies of the deceased raped

up in leather robes, lay [in rows] on board[s] covered with mats, &c we observed,
independant of the canoes which served as covering, fishing nets of various kinds,
Baskets of different Sizes, wooden boles, robes Skins, trenchers, and various kind of
trinkets, in and suspended on the ends of the pieces forming the vault; we also Saw
the Skeletons of Several Horses at the vault a great number of bones about it, which
convinced me that those animals were Sacrefised as well as the above articles to the
Deceased. after diner we proceeded on to a bad rapid at the lower point of a Small
Island on which four Lodges of Indians were Situated drying fish; here the high
countrey commences again on the Stard. Side leaveing a vallie of 40 miles in width,

Descending the Columbia to the Rapids
[Clark] OCTOBER 21ST MONDAY 1805
Passd. a Small Island at 5 1/2 miles a large one 8 miles in the middle of the river,
some rapid water at the head and Eight Lodges of nativs opposit its Lower point on
the Stard. Side, we came too at those lodges, bought some wood and brackfast,
Those people recived us with great kindness, and examined us with much attention,
their employments customs, Dress and appearance Similar to those above, Speak
the Same language, here we Saw two scarlet and a blue cloth blankets, also a Salors
Jacket1
we got from those people a fiew pounded roo[t]s fish and Acorns of white oake,
those Acorns they make use of as food raw & roasted and inform us they precure
them of the natives who live near the falls below which place they all discribe by the
term Timm at 2 miles lower passed a rapid large rocks stringing into the river of
large Size, opposit to this rapid on the Stard. Shore is Situated two Lodges of the
Nativs drying fish here we halted a fiew minits to examine the rapid before we
entered it which was our Constant Custom, and at all that was verry dangerous put
out all who Could not Swim to walk around, after passing this rapid we proceeded on
passed anoother rapid at 5 miles lower down, above this rapid maney large rocks on
each Side at Some distance from Shore, a little below is a bad rapid which is bad
crouded with hugh [huge] rocks scattered in every Direction which renders the
passage verry Difficult a little above this rapid on

the Lard. Side emence piles of rocks appears as if Sliped from the clifts under which
they lay, passed great number of rocks in every direction scattered in the river. 5
Lodges a little below on the Stard. Side, and one lodge on an Island near the Stard.
Shore opposit to which is a verry bad rapid, thro which we found much dificuelty in
passing, the river is crouded with rocks in every direction, after Passing this dificult
rapid [we came] to the mouth of a Small river on the Larboard Side.2
imediately above & below this little river commences a rapid which is crouded with
large rocks in every direction, the passage both crooked and dificuelt, we halted at a
Lodge to examine those noumerous Islands of rock which apd. to extend maney
miles below, great numbs. of Indians came in canoes to View us at this place, after
passing this rapid which we accomplished without loss; winding through between the
huge rocks for about 2 miles. proceeded on about two miles lower and landed and
encamped near five Lodges of nativs, drying fish those are the relations of those at
the great falls [Celilo Falls], they are pore and have but little wood which they bring
up the river from the falls as they Say, we purchased a little wood to cook our Dog
meat and fish; those people did not receive us at first with the same cordiality of
those above, they appeare to be the Same nation Speak the Same language with a
little curruption of maney words Dress and fish in the same way, all of whome have
pierced noses and the men when Dressed ware a long taper'd piece of Shell or beed
put through the nose.
one of the Old Chiefs who accompanies us pointed out a place on the Lard. Side
where they had a great battle, not maney years ago, in which maney were killed on
both Sides, One of our party J. Collins presented us with verry good beer made of
the Pa-shi-co-quar-mash [camass] bread, which bread is the remains of what was
laid in as a part of our Stores of Provisions, at the first flat heads or Cho-pun-nish
Nation at the head of the Kosskoske river which by being frequently wet molded &
sowered &c.
OCTOBER 22D TUESDAY 1805
A fine morning calm and fare we set out at 9 oClock passed a verry bad rapid at the
head of an Island close under the Stard.
2 John Day River.

Page 261
side above this rapid on the Stard. side is six Lodges of nativs Drying fish, at 9 mls.
passed a bad rapid at the head of a large Island of high & uneaven [rocks], jutting
over the water, a Small Island in a Stard. Bend opposit the upper point, on which I
counted 20 parcels of dryed and pounded fish; on the main Stand. Shore opposit to
this Island five Lodges of Indians are Situated, Several Indians in canoes killing fish
with gigs &c. opposit the center of this Island of rocks which is about 4 miles long we
discovered the enterence of a large river on the Lard. Side which appeared to come
from the S. E. we landed at some distance above the mouth of this river and Capt.
Lewis and my Self set out to view this river above its mouth,3
we proceeded on pass[ed] the mouth of this river at which place it appears to
discharge 1/4 as much water as runs down the Columbia. at two miles below this
River passed Eight Lodges on the Lower point of the Rock Island below this Island on
the main Stard. Shore is 16 Lodges of nativs, here we landed a fiew minits to Smoke,
the lower point of one Island opposit which heads in the mouth of Towornehiooks
[Des Chutes] River which I did not observe untill after passing these lodges about
1/2 a mile lower passed 6 more Lodges on the Same Side and 6 miles below the
upper mouth of Towornehiooks River the commencement of the pitch of the great
falls,4 opposit on the Stard. Side is 17 Lodges of the nativs we landed and walked
down accompanied by an old man to view the falls, and the best rout for to make a
portage which we Soon discovered was much nearest on the Stard. Side, and the
distance 1200 yards one third of the way on a rock, about 200 yards over a loose
Sand collected in a hollar blown by the winds from the bottoms below which was
disagreeable to pass, as it was steep and loose. at the lower part of those rapids we
arrived at 5 Lod[g]es of nativs drying and prepareing fish for market,
we returned droped down to the head of the rapids and took every article except the
Canoes across the portag[e] where I had formed a camp on [an] ellegable Situation
for the protection of our Stores from thieft, which we were more fearfull of, than
their arrows. we despatched two men to examine the river on the opposit Side, and
[they] reported that the canoes could be taken down a

4 Celilo Falls: the expedition is approaching the Narrows of the Columbia.

Page 262
narrow Chanel on the opposit Side after a Short portage at the head of the falls, at
which place the Indians take over their Canoes. Indians assisted us over the portage
with our heavy articles on their horses, the waters is divided into Several narrow
chanels which pass through a hard black rock forming Islands of rocks at this Stage
of the water, on those Islands of rocks as well as at and about their Lodges I
observe great numbers of Stacks of pounded Salmon neetly preserved in the
following manner, i. e. after [being] suffi[ci]ently Dried it is pounded between two
Stones fine, and put into a speces of basket neetly made of grass and rushes better
than two feet long and one foot Diamiter, which basket is lined with the Skin of
Salmon Stretched and dried for the purpose, in this it is pressed down as hard as is
possible, when full they Secure the open part with the fish Skins across which they
fasten th[r]o. the loops of the basket that part very securely, and then on a Dry
Situation they Set those baskets the corded part up, their common custome is to Set
7 as close as they can Stand and 5 on the top of them, and secure them with mats
which is raped around them and made fast with cords and covered also with mats,
those 12 baskets of from 90 to 100lbs. each form a Stack. thus preserved those fish
may be kept Sound and sweet Several years, as those people inform me, Great
quantities as they inform us are sold to the whites people who visit the mouth of this
river as well as to the nativs below.
OCTOBER 23D WEDNESDAY 1805
I with the greater part of the men crossed in the canoes to opposit side above the
falls and hauled them across the portage of 457 yards which is on the Lard. Side and
certainly the best side to pass the canoes, I then decended through a narrow chanel
of about 150 yards wide forming a kind of half circle in it[s] course of a mile to a
pitch of 8 feet in which the chanel is divided by 2 large rocks, at this place we were
obliged to let the Canoes down by strong ropes of Elk Skin which we had for the
purpose, one Canoe in passing this place got loose by the cords breaking, and was
cought by the Indians below. I accomplished this necessary business and landed
Safe with all the canoes at our Camp below the falls by 3 oClock P. M. nearly covered
with flees which were

Page 263
so thick amongst the Straw and fish Skins at the upper part of the portage at which
place the nativs had been Camped not long since; that every man of the party was
obliged to strip naked dureing the time of takeing over the canoes, that they might
have an oppertunity of brushing the flees of[f] their legs and bodies. Great numbers
of Sea Otters in the river below the falls, I shot one in the narrow chanel to day
which I could not get.5 Great numbers of Indians visit us both from above and
below. one of the old Chiefs who had accompanied us from the head of the river,
informed us that he herd the Indians Say that the nation below intended to kill us.
we examined all the arms &c. complete the amunition to 100 rounds. The nativs
leave us earlyer this evening than usial, which gives a Shadow of confermation to the
information of our old Chief, as we are at all times & places on our guard, are under
no greater apprehention than is common.
I observed on the beach near the Indian Lodges two butifull canoes of different
Shape & Size to what we had Seen above wide in the midd[l]e and tapering to each
end, on the bow curious figures were cut in the wood &c. Capt. Lewis went up to the
Lodges to See those Canoes and exchanged our Smallest canoe for one of them by
giveing a Hatchet & few trinkets to the owner who informed that he purchased it of a
white man below for a horse, these canoes are neeter made than any I have ever
Seen and calculated to ride the waves, and carry emence burthens, they are dug thin
and are suported by cross pieces of about 1 inch diamieter tied with Strong bark
thro' holes in the Sides.
OCTOBER 24TH THURSDAY 1805
our two old chiefs expressed a desire to return to their band from this place, Saying
"that they could be of no further Service to us, as their nation extended no further
down the river than those falls, (they could no longer understand the language of
these below the falls, till then not much difference in the vocabs.) and as the nation
below had expressed hostile intentions against us, would certainly kill them;
perticularly as they had been at war with each

appearance here is additional evidence that the party is nearing its destination.
So is the large coastal canoe of the next paragraph.

Page 264
other;'' we requested them to Stay with us two nights longer, our views were to
detain those Chiefs with us, untill we should pass the next falls, which we were told
were very bad, and at no great distance below, that they might inform us of any
designs of the nativs, and if possible to bring about a peace between them and the
tribes below.
The first pitch of this falls is 20 feet perpendecular, then passing thro' a narrow
chanel for 1 mile to rapid of about 8 feet fall below which the water has no
perceptable fall but very rapid Capt. Lewis and three men crossed the river and on
the opposit Side to view the falls which he had not yet taken a full view of. At 9
oClock a. m. I Set out with the party and proceeded on down a rapid Stream of
about 400 yards wide at 21/2 miles the river widened into a large bason to the Stard.
Side on which there is five Lodges of Indians. here a tremendious black rock
Presented itself high and Steep appearing to choke up the river; nor could I See
where the water passed further than the current was drawn with great velocity to the
Lard. Side of this rock at which place I heard a great roreing. I landed at the Lodges
and the natives went with me to the top of this rock which makes from the Stard.
Side, from the top of which I could See the dificuelties we had to pass for Several
miles below; at this place the water of this great river is compressed into a chanel
between two rocks not exceeding forty five yards wide and continues for a 1/4 of a
mile when it again widens to 200 yards and continues this width for about 2 miles
when it is again intersepted by rocks. The whole of the Current of this great river
must at all Stages pass thro' this narrow chanel of 45 yards wide.6
as the portage of our canoes over this high rock would be impossible with our
Strength, and the only danger in passing thro those narrows was the whorls and
swills [swells] arriseing from the Compression of the water, and which I thought (as
also our principal watermen Peter Crusat) by good Stearing we could pass down
Safe, accordingly I deturmined to pass through this place notwithstanding the horrid
appearance of this agitated gut swelling, boiling & whorling in every direction, which
from the top of the rock did not appear as bad as when I was in it; however we
passed Safe to the astonishment of all the Inds. of the last Lodges
6 The Short Narrows, or The Dalles proper.

Page 265
who viewed us from the top of the rock. passed one Lodge below this rock, and
halted on the Stard. Side to view a very bad place, the current divided by 2 Islands
of rocks the lower of them large and in the midal of the river, this place being verry
bad I sent by land all the men who could not Swim and such articles as was most
valuable to us such as papers Guns & amunition, and proceeded down with the
canoes two at a time to a village of 20 wood houses in a Deep bend to the Stard.
Side below which [was] a rugid black rock
The nativs of this village re[ce]ived me verry kindly, one of whome envited me into
his house, which I found to be large and comodious, and the first wooden houses in
which Indians have lived Since we left those in the vicinity of the Illinois, they are
scattered permiscuisly on a elivated Situation near a mound of about 30 feet above
the Common leavel, which mound has Some remains of houses and has every
appearance of being artificial. one half of those houses is apropriated for the storeing
away Dried & pounded fish which is the principal food, the other part next the dore is
the part occupied by the nativs who have beds raised on either side, with a fire place
in the center of this Space each house appeared to be occupied by about three
families; that part which is apropriated for fish was crouded with that article, and a
fiew baskets of burries.
I dispatched a Sufficent number of the good Swimers back for the 2 canoes above
the last rapid, and with 2 men walked down three miles to examine the river Over a
bed of rocks, which the water at verry high fluds passes over, on those rocks I Saw
Several large scaffols on which the Indians dry fish, as this is out of Season the poles
on which they dry those fish are tied up verry Securely in large bundles and put upon
the scaffolds, I counted 107 stacks of dried pounded fish in different places on those
rocks which must have contained 10.000 lb of neet fish, The evening being late I
could not examine the river to my Satisfaction, I returned through a rockey open
countrey infested with pole-cats to the village; here we formed a camp near the
village, The principal chief from the nation below with Several of his men visited us,
and afforded a favourable oppertunity of bringing about a Piece and good
understanding between this chief and his people and the two chiefs who
accompanied us, Peter Crusat played on the violin and

Page 266
the men danced which delighted the nativs, who Shew every civility towards us. we
Smoked with those people untill late at night, when every one retired to rest.
OCTOBER 25TH FRIDAY 1805
Capt. Lewis and my Self walked down to See the place the Indians pointed out as the
worst place in passing through the gut, which we found difficuelt of passing without
great danger, but as the portage was impracti[c]able with our large canoes, we
concluded to Make a portage of our most valuable articles and run the canoes thro.7
accordingly on our return divided the party Some to take over the Canoes, and
others to take our Stores across a portage of a mile to a place on the chanel below
this bad whorl & Suck, with Some others I had fixed on the Chanel with roapes to
throw out to any who Should unfortunately meet with difficuelty in passing through;
great number of Indians viewing us from the high rocks under which we had to pass,
the 3 fir[s]t canoes passed thro very well, the 4th nearly filled with water, the last
passed through by takeing in a little water, thus Safely below what I conceved to be
the worst part of this chanel felt my self extreamly gratified and pleased.
We loaded the Canoes & set out, and had not proceeded more than 2 mile[s] before
the unfortunate Canoe which filled crossing the bad place above, run against a rock
and was in great danger of being lost; this Chanel is through a hard rough black
rock, from 50 to 100 yards wide, swelling and boiling in a most tremendious maner;
we passed through a deep bason to the Stard. Side of 1 mile below which the River
narrows and [is] divided by a rock the curent we found quit[e] gentle, here we met
with our two old chiefs who had been to a village below to smoke a friendly pipe and
at this place they met the Chief & party from the village above on his return from
hunting all of whome were then crossing over their horses, we landed to Smoke a
pipe with this Chief whome we found to be a bold pleasing looking man of about 50
years of age dressd. in a war jacket a cap Legins & mockesons. he gave us some
meat of which he had but little and informed us he in his rout met with a war party of
Snake Indians

Page 267
from the great river of the S. E. which falls in a few miles above and had a fight. we
gave this Chief a Medal, &c. [had] a parting Smoke with our two faithful friends the
chiefs who accompanied us from the head of the river, (who had purchased a horse
each with 2 rob[e]s and intended to return on horseback)8
we proceeded on down the water fine, rocks in every derection for a fiew miles when
the river widens and becoms a butifull jentle Stream of about half a mile wide, Great
numbers of the Sea orter [or Seals] about those narrows and both below and above.
we came too, under a high point of rocks on the Lard. Side below a creek of 20 yards
wide and much water, as it was necessary to make Some Selestial observations we
formed our camp on the top of a high point of rocks, which forms a kind of
fortification in the Point between the river & creek, with a boat guard,
The expedition remains in camp for the next two days, making observations,
hunting, and repairing the dugouts.
[Clark] OCTOBER 28TH MONDAY 1805
A cool windey morning we loaded our canoes and Set out at 9 oClock, a. m. as we
were about to set out 3 canoes from above and 2 from below came to view us in one
of those canoes I observed an Indian with round hat Jacket & wore his hair cued we
proceeded on at four miles we landed at a Village of 8 houses on the Stard. Side
under some rugid rocks, I entered one of the houses in which I saw a British
musket, a cutlash and Several brass Tea kittles of which they appeared verry fond
Saw them boiling fish in baskets with Stones, here we purchased five Small Dogs,
Some dried buries, & white bread made of roots, the wind rose and we were obliged
to lie by all day at 1 mile below on the Lard Side. we had not been long on Shore
before a Canoe came up with a man woman & 2 children, who had a fiew roots to
Sell, Soon after maney others joined them from above, The wind which is the cause
of our delay, does not retard the motions of those people at all, as their canoes are
calculated to ride the highest waves, they are built of white cedar or Pine verry light
wide in the middle and tapers at each end, with
8 The two Nez Percés, who here take the back trail.

blew hard accompanied with rain all the evening, our Situation not a verry good one
for an encampment, but such as it is we are obliged to put up with, the harbor is a
Safe one, we encamped on the Sand, wet and disagreeable
OCTOBER 29TH TUESDAY 1805
A cloudy morning wind from the west but not hard, we Set out at day light, and
proceeded on about five miles came too on the Stard. Side at a village of 7 houses
built in the Same form and materials of those above, I observed in the lodge of the
chief sundery articles which must have been precured from the white people, Such
[as] a Scarlet & blue cloth Sword Jacket & hat. I also observed two wide Split boards
w[i]th images on them cut and painted in emitation of a man; The Chief directed his
wife to hand him his medison bag which he opened and Showed us 14 fingers which
he said was the fingers of his enemies which he had taken in war, this is the first
Instance I ever knew of the Indians takeing any other trofea of their exploits off the
dead bodies of their Enimies except the Scalp. The chief painted those fingers with
Several other articles which was in his bag red and securely put them back, haveing
first mad[e] a short harrang which I suppose was bragging of what he had done in
war. we purchased 12 Dogs and 4 Sacks of fish, & some fiew ascid berries, after
brackfast we proceeded on, the mountains are high on each side, containing
scattering pine white Oake & under groth, hill Sides Steep and rockey; at 4 miles
lower we observed a small river falling in with great rapidity on the Stard. Side below
which is a village of 11 houses, here we landed to Smoke a pipe with the nativs
we purchased 4 dogs and set out. (this village is the of the Same nation of the one
we last passed) and proceeded on. The countrey on each side begin[s] to be thicker
timbered with Pine and low white oake; verry rockey and broken. passed three large
rocks in the river the middle rock is large long and has Several Squar vaults on it, we
call this rockey Island the Sepulchar. The last river we passed we shall call the
Cataract River from the number of falls which the Indians say is on it, passed 2
Lodges of Indians a short distance below the sepulchor Island on the Stard. Side.

Page 269
river wide, at 4 mile passed 2 houses on the Stard. Side, six miles lower passed 4
houses above the mouth of a Small river 40 yards wide on the Lard. Side a thick
timbered bottom above & back of those houses, those are the first houses which we
have seen on the South Side of the Columbia River, (and the axess to those dificuelt)
for fear of the approach of their common enemies the Snake Indians,9
OCTOBER 30TH WEDNESDAY 1805
A cool morning, a moderate rain all the last night, after eating a partial brackfast of
venison we Set out, Saw 4 Cascades caused by Small Streams falling from the
mountains on the Lard. Side, Some rain, we landed above the mouth of a Small river
on the Stard. Side and Dined, J. Shields Killed a Buck & Labeash 3 Ducks, here the
river widens to about one mile large Sand bar in the middle, a great [rock] both in
and out of the water, large Stones or rocks are also permiscuisly scattered about in
the river, The day proved cloudy dark and disagreeable with some rain all day which
kept us wet. The countary a high mountain on each side thickly covered with timber,
such as Spruce, Pine, Cedar, oake Cotton &c. &c. I took two men and walked down
three miles to examine the Shute10 and river below proceeded along an old Indian
path, passd. an old village at 1 mile on an ellevated Situation, Capt. L. Saw one gun
and Several articles which must have been precured from the white people. a wet
disagreeable evening, the only wood we could get to burn on this little Island on
which we have encamped is the newly discovered Ash, which makes a tolerable fire.
OCTOBER 31ST THURSDAY 1805
A cloudy rainey disagreeable morning I proceeded down the river to view with more
attention [the rapids] we had to pass on the river below, the two men with me. Jo.
Fields & Peter Crusat proceeded down to examine the rapids the Great Shute which
commenced at the Island on which we encamped continued with
9 The ''Snake Indians" reported on this stretch of the Columbia were probably
the Bannocks.
10 The beginning of the ferocious rapids called the Cascades, which were to
become notorious in the years of the Oregon immigration. They are now covered
by the water backed up by Bonneville Dam.

Page 270
great rapidity and force thro a narrow chanel much compressd. and interspersed
with large rocks for 1\2 a mile, at a mile lower is a verry considerable rapid at which
place the waves are remarkably high, and proceeded on in a old Indian parth 21\2
miles by land thro a thick wood & hill Side, to the river where the Indians make a
portage, from this place I Dispatched Peter Crusat (our principal waterman) back to
follow the river and examine the practibility of the canoes passing, as the rapids
appeared to continue down below as far as I could See, I with Jo Fields proceeded
on,
the mountain which is but low on the Stard. Side, leave[s] the river, and a leavel
stoney open bottom suckceeds on the Said Std. Side for a great Distance down, the
mountains high and rugid on the Lard. Side this open bottom is about 2 miles a Short
distance below this village is a bad Stoney rapid and appears to be the last in view I
observed at this lower rapid the remains of a large and antient Village which I could
plainly trace by the Sinks in which they had formed their houses, as also those in
which they had buried their fish. from this rapid to the lower end of the portage the
river is crouded with rocks of various sises between which the water passes with
great velociety createing in many places large waves, an Island which is Situated
near the Lard. Side occupies about half the distance the lower point of which is at
this rapid. immediately below this rapid the high water passes through a narrow
chanel through the Stard. Bottom forming an Island of 3 miles Long & one wide; I
walked through this Island which I found to be verry rich land, and had every
appearance of haveing been at some distant period cultivated at this time it is
covered with grass intersperced with strawberry vines, I could not see any rapids
below in the extent of my view which was for a long distance down the river, which
from the last rapids widened and had everry appearance of being effected by the tide
[this was in fact the first tide water] I deturmind to return to camp 10 miles distant,
a remarkable high detached rock Stands in a bottom on the Stard. Side near the
lower point of this Island on the Stard. Side about 800 feet high and 400 paces
around, we calle the Beaten [Beacon] rock.11
One of the men shot a goose above this Great Shute, which was floating into the
Shute, when an Indian observed it, plunged! into

[great danger, rapids bad, a descent close by him (150 feet off,) of all Columbia
River, current dashed among rocks, if he had got in the Suck lost] as this Indian
richly earned the goose I suffered him to keep it which he about half picked and
Spited it up with the guts in it to roste.
This Great Shute or falls is about 1\2 a mile, with the water of this great river
compressed within the space of 150 paces in which there is great numbers of both
large and Small rocks, water passing with great velocity forming [foaming] & boiling
in a most horriable manner, with a fall of about 20 feet, below it widens to about 200
paces and current gentle for a Short distance.
NOVEMBER 1ST FRIDAY 1805
A verry cool morning wind hard from the N. E. The Indians who arrived last evening
took their Canoes on ther Sholders and carried them below the Great Shute, we Set
about takeing our Small canoe and all the baggage by land 940 yards of bad slippery
and rockey way. The Indians we discovered took ther loading the whole length of the
portage 21\2 miles, to avoid a second Shute which appears verry bad to pass, and
thro' which they passed with their empty canoes. Great numbers of Sea Otters, they
are so cautious that I with dificuelty got a Shot at one today, which I must have
killed, but could not get him as he Sunk.
We got all our baggage over the Portage of 940 yards, after which we got the 4 large
canoes over by slipping them over the rocks on poles placed across from one rock to

canoes over the rocks &c. three of them rec[ei]ved injuries which obliged us to delay
to have them repared. Several Indian Canoes arrived at the head of the portage,
Some of the men accompanied by those from the village come down to Smoke with
us, they appear to Speak the same language with a little different axcent
I cannot lern certainly as to the traffick those Inds. carry on below, if white people or
the indians who trade with the whites who are either settled or visit the mouth of this
river. I believe mostly with the latter as their knowledge of the white people appears
to be verry imperfect, and the articles which they appear to trade mostly i. e.
Pounded fish, Beargrass, and roots; cannot be an object of comerce with furin
merchants. however they git in return for those

Page 272
articles Blue and white beeds copper Kettles, brass arm bands, some scarlet and
blue robes and a fiew articles of old clothes, they prefer beeds to any thing, and will
part with the last mouthfull or articles of clothing they have for a fiew of those beeds,
those beeds the[y] trafick with Indians Still higher up this river for roabs, Skins,
cha-pel-el [biscuitroot] bread, beargrass &c. who in their turn trafick with those
under the rockey mountains for Beargrass, quarmash roots & robes &c.
The nativs of the waters of the Columbia appear helthy, Some have tumers on
different parts of their bodies. and Sore and weak Eyes are common, maney have
lost their Sight entirely, great numbers with one eye out and frequently the other
verry weak, This misfortune I must again asscribe to the water &c. They have bad
teeth, which is not common with indians, maney have worn their teeth down and
Some quite into their gums, this I cannot satisfactorily account for it, do ascribe it in
some measure to their method of eateing, their food, roots pert[i]cularly, which they
make use of as they are taken out of the earth frequently nearly covered with sand, I
have not Seen any of their long roots offered for Sale clear of sand. They are rether
below the Common Size high cheeks womin Small and homely, and have Swelled
legs and thighs, and their knees remarkably large which I ascribe to the method in
which they sit on their hams go nearly necked wareing only a piece of leather tied
about their breast which falls down nearly as low as the waste, a small roabe about 3
feet square, and a piece of leather tied about their breach, They [womin] have all flat
heads in this quarter both men and women. They are dirty in the extream, both in
their person and cookery. ware their hare loose hanging in every direction. They ask
high prices for what they Sell and Say that the white people below give great prices
for every thing &c.
The noses are all pierced and when they are dressed they have a long tapered piece
of white shell or wampum put through the nose, those Shells are about 2 inches in
length. I observed in maney of the villeages which I have passed, the heads of the
female children in the press for the purpose of compressing their heads in their
infancy into a certain form, between two boards

Examined the rapid below us more pert[i]celarly the danger appearing too great to
Hazzard our Canoes loaded, dispatched all the men who could not Swim with loads
to the end of the portage below, I also walked to the end of the portage with the
carriers where I delayed until everry articles was brought over and canoes arrived
Safe. here we brackfast and took a Meridn. altitude. about the time we were Setting
out 7 Squars came over loaded with Dried fish, and bear grass neetly buldled up,
Soon after 4 Indian men came down over the rapid in a large canoe. passed a rapid
at 2 miles & 1 at 4 miles opposit the lower point of a high Island on the Lard. Side,
and a little below 4 Houses on the Stard. Bank, a Small creek on the Lard. Side
opposit Strawberry Island, which heads below the last rapid, opposit the lower point
of this Island passed three Islands covered with tall timber opposit the Beaten rock,
Those Islands are nearest the Starboard Side; imediately below on the Stard. Side
passed a village of nine houses, which is Situated between 2 Small creeks, and are of
the Same construction of those above; here the river widens to near a mile, and the
bottoms are more extensive and thickly timbered, as also the high mountains on
each Side, with Pine, Spruce pine, cotton wood, a Species of ash, and alder. at 17
miles passed a rock near the middle of the river, about 100 feet high and 80 feet
Diameeter, proceed on down a smoth gentle Stream of about 2 miles wide, in which
the tide has its effect as high as the Beaten rock or the Last rapids at

river here about 2-1/2 miles wide. Seven Indians in a canoe on their way down to
trade with the nativs below, encamp with us, those we left at the portage passed us
this evening and proceeded on down. The ebb tide rose here about 9 Inches, the
flood tide must rise here much higher.
NOVEMBER 3D SUNDAY 1805
The Fog so thick this morning that we could not see a man 50 Steps off, this fog
detained us until 10 oClock at which time we Set out, accompanied by our Indian
friends who are from a village near the great falls,
A Mountain which we Suppose to be Mt. Hood, is S. 85° E about 47 miles distant.
This Mtn. is covered with Snow and in the range of mountains which we have passed
through and is of a conical form but rugid. proceeded on to the center of a large
Island in the middle of the river which we call Dimond Island from its appearance,
here we met 15 Indn. men in 2 canoes from below, they informed us they Saw 3
vestles below &c. &c. we landed on the North side of this Dimond Island and
Encamped, a canoe arrived from the village below the last rapid with a man his wife
and 3 children, and a woman whome had been taken prisoner from the Snake Inds.
on Clarks River I sent the Interpreters wife who is a So so ne or Snake Indian of the
Missouri, to Speake to this squar, they could not understand each other Sufficiently
to converse.2 This family and the Inds. we met from below continued with us. Capt.
Lewis borrowed a Small canoe of those Indians & 4 men took her across to a Small
lake in the

Isld. he killed a Swan and Several Ducks, which made our number of fowls this
evening 3 Swan, 8 brant and 5 Ducks, on which we made a Sumpteous supper. We
gave the Indian who lent the Canoe a brant, and some meat to the others. one of
those Indians, the man from the village near the Lower Rapids has a gun with a
brass barrel & cock of which he prises highly Note the mountain we saw from near
the forks proves to be Mount Hood
NOVEMBER 4TH MONDAY 1805
Shannon set out early to walk on the Island to kill something, he joined us at the
lower point with a Buck. (Tide rose last night 18 inches perpendicular at Camp) near
the lower point of this dimond Island is the head of a large Island Seperated from a
Small one by a narrow chanel, and both Situated nearest the Lard. Side, on the Main
Lard. Shore a Short distance below the last Island we landed at a village of 25
houses: 24 of those houses we[re] thached with Straw, and covered with bark, the
other House is built of boards in the form of those above, except that it is above
ground and about 50 feet in length [and covered with broad split boards] This village
contains about 200 Men of the Skilloot nation I counted 52 canoes on the bank in
front of this village maney of them verry large and raised in bow. we recognized the
man who over took us last night, (our pilot who came in his canoe) he invited us to
a lodge in which he had Some part and gave us a roundish roots about the Size of a
Small Irish potato which they roasted in the embers until they became Soft, This root
they call Wap-pa-to the Bulb of which the Chinese cultivate in great quantities called
the Sa-git ti folia or common arrow head, (we believe it to be the Same) it has an
agreeable taste and answers verry well in place of bread. we purchased about 4
bushels of this root and divided it to our party,
at 7 miles below this village passed the upper point of a large Island nearest the
Lard. Side, a Small Prarie in which there is a pond opposit on the Stard. here I landed
and walked on Shore, about 3 miles a fine open Prarie for about 1 mile, back of
which the countrey rises gradually and wood land comencies Saw Some Elk and Deer
Sign, and joined Capt. Lewis at a place he had landed with the party for Diner. Soon
after Several canoes of Indians from the village above came down, dressed for

Page 276
the purpose as I supposed of Paying us a friendly visit, they had scarlet & blue
blankets Salor Jackets, overalls, Shirts and hats independant of their usial dress; the
most of them had either [war axes Spears or Bows Sprung with quivers of arrows,]
Muskets or pistols and tin flasks to hold their powder, Those fellows we found
assumeing and disagreeable, however we Smoked with them and treated them with
every attention & friendship.
dureing the time we were at dinner those fellows Stold my pipe Tomahawk which
they were Smoking with, I imediately serched every man and the canoes, but could
find nothing of my Tomahawk, while Serching for the Tomahawk one of those
Scoundals Stole a cappoe [capote] of one of our interperters, which was found
Stufed under the root of a tree, near the place they Sat, we became much displeased
with those fellows, which they discovered and moved off on their return home to
their village, except 2 canoes which had passed on down. we proceeded on met a
large & a Small canoe from below with 12 men the large canoe was ornimented with
Images carved in wood the figures of a Bear in front & a man in Stern, Painted &
fixed verry netely on the canoe, rising to near the hight of a man two Indians verry
finely Dressed & with hats on was in this canoe passed the lower point of the Island
which is nine miles in length3 haveing passed 2 Islands on the Stard. Side of this
large Island, three Small Islands at its lower point. the Indians make Signs that a
village is Situated back of those Islands on the Lard. Side. and I believe that a chanel
is Still on the Lrd. Side as a canoe passed in between the Small Islands, and made
Signs that way, probably to traffick with some of the nativs liveing on another
chanel.
at 3 miles lower, and 12 Leagues below quick sand river passed a village of four
large houses on the Lard. Side, near which we had a full view of Mt. Helien [St.
Helens] which is perhaps the highest pinical in America it bears N. 25°. E. about 90
miles. This is the mountain I saw from the Muscle Shell rapid on the 19th of October
last4 covered with Snow, it rises Something in the form of a Sugar lofe about a mile
lower passed a Single house on the
3 Sauvie Island. It masks the mouth of the great Willamette River, whose
existence Clark does not yet suspect.
4 Clark is wrong on both counts. Mount St. Helens is one of the lesser Cascade
peaks (alt. 9671 ft.) and, as has been noted, the one he saw on October 19 was
probably Mount Adams.

Page 277
Lard. Side, and one on the Stard. Side, passed a village on each side and camped
near a house on the Stard. Side we proceeded on untill one hour after dark with a
view to get clear of the nativs who was constantly about us, and troublesom, finding
that we could not get Shut of those people for one night, we landed and Encamped
on the Stard. Side Soon after 2 canoes came to us loaded with Indians, we
purchased a fiew roots of them.
The Indians which we have passed to day (in their boats were of) of the Scil-loot
nation (going up to the falls differ a little) in their language from those near & about
the long narrows their dress differ but little, except they have more of the articles
precured from the white traders, they all have flatened heads both men and women,
live principally on fish and Wap pa too roots, They are thievishly inclined as we have
experienced.
NOVEMBER 5TH TUESDAY 1805
Rained all the after part of last night, rain continues this morning, I [s]lept but verry
little last night for the noise Kept [up] dureing the whole of the night by the Swans,
Geese, white & Grey Brant Ducks &c. on a Small Sand Island close under the Lard.
Side; they were emensely noumerous, and their noise horid. We met 4 Canoes of
Indians from below, in which there is 26 Indians, one of those canoes is large, and
ornimented with Images on the bow & Stern. That in the Bow [is] the likeness of a
Bear, and in the Stern the picture of a man. The day proved cloudy with rain the
greater part of it, we are all wet cold and disagreeable I killed a grouse which was
verry fat, and larger than common. This is the first night which we have been entirely
clear of Indians since our arrival on the waters of the Columbia River.
NOVEMBER 6TH WEDNESDAY 1805
A cool wet raney morning we Set out early the Indians of the 2 Lodges we passed to
day came in their canoes with Sundery articles to Sell, we purchased of them
Wap-pa-too roots, salmontrout, and I purchased 2 beaver Skins for which I gave 5
small fish hooks. we over took two Canoes of Indians going down5 to trade, one of
the Indians Spoke a fiew words of english and Said that the
5 Down to the coast to find some ship that was engaged in the Northwest
trade.

Page 278
principal man who traded with them was Mr. Haley, and that he had a woman in his
Canoe who Mr. Haley was fond of &c. he Showed us a Bow of Iron and Several other
things which he Said Mr. Haley gave him.
we came too to Dine on [a] long narrow Island found the woods so thick with under
groth that the hunters could not get any distance into the Isld. the red wood, and
Green bryers interwoven, and mixed with pine, alder, a Speci[e]s of Beech, ash &c.
we killed nothing to day. The Indians leave us in the evening, river about one mile
wide hills high and Steep on the Std. No place for Several Miles suff[i]cently large
and leavil for our camp, we at length Landed at a place which by moveing the stones
we made a place Sufficently large for the party to lie leavil on the Smaller Stones
clear of the Tide. Cloudy with rain all day we are all wet and disagreeable, had large
fires made on the Stone and dried our bedding and kill the flees which collected in
our blankets at every old village we encamped near
NOVEMBER 7TH THURSDAY 1805
A cloudy foggey morning Some rain. we Set out early proceeded under the Stard.
Side under a high rugid hills with Steep assent the Shore boalt and rockey, the fog so
thick we could not See across the river, two cano[e]s of Indians met and returned
with us to their village, they gave us to eate Some fish, and Sold us, fish, Wap pa to
roots three dogs and 2 otter skins for which we gave fish hooks principally of which
they were verry fond.
Those people call themselves War-ci-â-cum and Speake a language different from
the nativs above with whome they trade for the Wapato roots of which they make
great use of as food. their houses differently built, raised entirely above ground
eaves about 5 feet from the ground Supported and covered in the same way of those
above, dores about the Same size but in the Side of the house in one corner, one fire
place and that near the opposit end, around which they have their beads raised
about 4 feet from the flore which is of earth, under their beads they Store away
baskets of dried fish Berries & Wappato, over the fire they hang the fiesh as they
take them and [of] which they do not make immediate use. Their Canoes are of the
Same form of those above.
after delaying at this village one hour and a half we Set out

Page 279
piloted by an Indian dressed in a Salors dress, to the Main Chanel of the river, the
tide being in we should have found much dificuelty in passing into the main Chanel
from behind those islands, without a pilot, here we see a great numbers of water
fowls about those Marshey Islands; here the high mountanious Countrey approaches
the river on the Lard Side, a high Mountn. to the S. W. about 20 miles, the high
mountans. countrey continue on the Stard. Side, about 14 miles below the last
village we landed at a village of the same nation. it contains 7 indifferent houses built
in the same form of those above, here we purchased a Dog some fish, wap pa to,
roots and I purchased 2 beaver Skins for the purpose of makeing me a roab, as the
robe I have is rotten and good for nothing. opposit to this village the high
mountaneous countrey leave[s] the river on the Lard. Side below which the river
widens into a kind of Bay & is crouded with low Islands Subject to be covered by the
tides. We proceeded on about 12 miles below the Village under a high mountaneous
Countrey on the Stard. Side, Shore boald and rockey and Encamped under a high hill
on the Stard. Side opposit to a rock Situated half a mile from the shore, about 50
feet high and 20 Deamieter; we with dificuelty found a place clear of the tide and
Sufficiently large to lie on and the only place we could get was on round stones on
which we lay our mats rain continued. moderately all day & Two Indians
accompanied us from the last village, they we detected in Stealing a knife and
returned,
Great joy in camp we are in view of the Ocian, this great Pacific Octean which we
been so long anxious to See.6 and the roreing or noise made by the waves brakeing
on the rockey Shores (as I suppose) may be heard disti[n]ctly
NOVEMBER 8TH FRIDAY 1805
A cloudy morning Some rain, we did not Set out untill 9 oClock, haveing changed our
Clothing. three Indians in a Canoe overtook us, with salmon to Sell, we came too at
the remains of an old village at the bottom of this nitch and dined, here we Saw great
numbers of fowl, Sent out 2 men and they killed a Goose and two canves back
Ducks here we found great numbers of

Page 280
flees which we treated with the greatest caution and distance; after Diner the Indians
left us and we took the advantage of a returning tide and proceeded on to the
Second point on the Std. here we found the Swells or Waves so high that we thought
it imprudent to proceed; we landed unloaded and drew up our Canoes.7
Some rain all day at intervales, we are all wet and disagreeable, as we have been for
Several days past, and our present Situation a verry disagreeable one in as much as
we have not leavel land Sufficient for an encampment and for our baggage to lie
cleare of the tide, the High hills jutting in so close and steep that we cannot retreat
back, and the water of the river too Salt to be used, added to this the waves are
increasing to Such a hight that we cannot move from this place, in this Situation we
are compelled to form our camp between the hite of the Ebb and flood tides, and
rase our baggage on logs. We are not certain as yet if the white people who trade
with those people or from whome they precure their goods are Stationary at the
mouth, or visit this quarter at stated times for the purpose of trafick &c. I believe the
latter to be the most probably conjecture. The Seas roled and tossed the Canoes in
such a manner this evening that Several of our party were Sea sick.
NOVEMBER 9TH SATURDAY 1805
The tide of last night did not rise Sufficiently high to come into our camp, but the
Canoes which was exposed to the mercy of the waves &c. which accompanied the
returning tide, they all filled, and with great attention we Saved them untill the tide
left them dry. wind Hard from the South, and rained hard all the fore part of the day,
at 2 oClock P M the flood tide came in accompanied with emence waves and heavy
winds, floated the trees and Drift which was on the point on which we Camped and
tossed them about in such a manner as to endanger the canoes verry much, with
every exertion and the Strictest attention by every individual of the party was
scercely sufficient to Save our Canoes from being crushed by those monsterous
trees maney of them nearly 200 feet long and from 4 to 7 feet through. our camp
entirely under water dureing the hight of the tide, every man as wet as

Bay. (Not to be confused with Gray's Harbor.)

water could make them all the last night and to day all day as the rain continued all
day, at 4 oClock P M the wind Shifted about to the S. W. and blew with great
violence imediately from the Ocean for about two hours, notwithstanding the
disagreeable Situation of our party all wet and cold (and one which they have
experienced for Several days past) they are chearfull and anxious to See further into
the Ocian, The Water of the river being too Salt to use we are obliged to make use of
rain water. Some of the party not accustomed to Salt water has made too free a use
of it on them it acts as a pergitive.
At this dismal point we must Spend another night as the wind & waves are too high
to proceed.
NOVEMBER 10TH SUNDAY 1805
rained verry hard the greater part of the last night & continues this morning, the
wind has layed and the swells are fallen. we loaded our canoes and proceeded on,
The wind rose from the N W. and the swells became so high, we were compelled to
return about 2 miles to a place where we could unld. our canoes, which was in a
small Bay on Driftwood on which we had also to make our fires to dry our selves as
well as we could, the shore being either a clift of Purpendicular rocks or steep
assents to the hight of 4 or 500 feet, we continued on this drift wood untill about 3
oClock when the evening appearing favourable we loaded & set out in hopes to turn
the Point below and get into a better harber, but finding the waves & swells continue
to rage with great fury below, we got a safe place for our stores & a much beter one
for the canoes to lie and formed a campment on Drift logs in the same little Bay
under a high hill at the enterence of a small drean, which we found very convt. on
account of its water, as that of the river is Brackish. The logs on which we lie is all on
flote every high tide. The rain continues all day. we are all wet also our bedding and
maney other articles. we are all employed untill late drying our bedding. nothing to
eate but Pounded fish.
NOVEMBER 11TH MONDAY 1805
A hard rain all the last night, dureing the last tide the logs on which we lay was all on
float, Sent out Jo Fields to hunt, he Soon returned and informed us that the hills was
So high & Steep,

Page 282
& thick with undergroth and fallen Timber that he could not get out any distance;
about 12 oClock 5 Indians came down in a canoe, the wind verry high from the S. W.
with most tremendious waves brakeing with great violence against the Shores, rain
falling in torrents, we are all wet as usial and our Situation is truly a disagreeable
one; the great quantites of rain which has loosened the Stones on the hill Sides; and
the Small stones fall down upon us, our canoes at one place at the mercy of the
waves, our baggage in another; and our selves and party Scattered on floating logs
and Such dry Spots as can be found on the hill sides, and crivicies of the rocks. we
purchased of the Indians 13 red charr which we found to be an excellent fish. they
are badly clad & illy made, Small and Speak a language much resembling the last
nation, one of those men had on a Salors Jacket and Pantiloons. and made Signs
that he got those clothes from the white people who lived below the point &c. those
people left us and crossed the river (which is about 5 miles wide at this place)
through the highest waves I ever Saw a Small vestles ride. Those Indians are
certainly the best Canoe navigaters I ever Saw. rained all day.
NOVEMBER 12TH TUESDAY 1805
A Tremendious wind from the S. W. about 3 oClock this morning with Lightineng and
hard claps of Thunder, and Hail which Continued untill 6 oClock a. m. when it
became light for a Short time, then the heavens became sudenly darkened by a black
cloud from the S. W. and rained with great violence untill 12 oClock, the waves
tremendious breaking with great fury against the rocks and trees on which we were
encamped. our Situation is dangerous. we took the advantage of a low tide and
moved our camp around a point to a Small wet bottom, at the Mouth of a Brook,
which we had not observed when we came to this cove; from its being verry thick
and obscured by drift trees and thick bushes. It would be distressing to See our
Situation, all wet and colde our bedding also wet, (and the robes of the party which
compose half the bedding is rotten and we are not in a Situation to supply their
places) in a wet bottom scercely large enough to contain us our baggage half a mile
from us, and Canoes at the mercy of the waves, altho Secured as well as possible,
Sunk with emence parcels of Stone to wate them down to prevent their dashing to
pecies against

Page 283
the rocks; one got loose last night and was left on a rock a Short distance below,
without rec[ei]ving more damage than a Split in her bottom. Fortunately for us our
men are healthy. 3 men Gibson Bratten & Willard attempted to go arou[n]d the point
below in our Indian Canoe, much Such a canoe as the Indians visited us in
yesterday, they proceeded to the point from which they were oblige[d] to return, the
waves tossing them about at will. I walked up the branch and giged 3 Salmon trout.
NOVEMBER 13TH WEDNESDAY 1805
Some intervales of fair weather last night, rain continue[d] this morning. I walked up
the Brook & assended the first Spur of the mountain with much fatigue, the distance
about 3 miles, through an intolerable thickets of Small pine, a groth much resembling
arrow wood on the Stem of which there is thorns this groth about 12 or 15 feet high
interlocked. into each other and scattered over the high fern & fallen timber, added
to this the hills were so steep that I was compelled to draw my Self up by the
assistance of those bushes. The Timber on those hills are of the pine species large
and tall maney of them more than 200 feet high & from 8 to 10 feet through at the
Stump the rain continuing and weather proved So cloudy that I could not See any
distance. on my return we dispatched 3 men Colter, Willard and Shannon in the
Indian canoe to get around the point if possible and examine the river, and the Bay
below for a go[o]d harber for our canoes to lie in Safty &c. The tide at every floot
tide came in [with great swells brakeing against the rocks and Drift trees] with great
fury. The rain continue all day. nothing to eate but pounded fish which we Keep as a
reserve and use in Situations of this kind.
NOVEMBER 14TH THURSDAY 1805
rained all the last night without intermition, and this morning. wind blows verry hard,
but our situation is Such that we cannot tell from what point it comes. one of our
canoes is much broken by the waves dashing it against the rocks. 5 Indians came up
in a canoe, thro' the waves which is verry high and role with great fury. They made
Signs to us that they saw 3 men we Sent down yesterday. only 3 of those Indians
landed, the other 2 which was

Page 284
women played off in the waves, which induced me to Suspect that they had taken
Something from our men below, at this time one of the men Colter returnd. by land
and informed us that those Indians had taken his Gigg & basket, I called to the
Squars to land and give back the gigg, which they would not doe untill a man run
with a gun, as if he intended to Shute them when they landed, and Colter got his gig
& basket
Colter informed us that it was but a Short distance from where we lay around the
point to a butifull Sand beech which continued for a long ways, that he had found a
good harber in the mouth of a creek near 2 Indian Lodges that he had proceeded in
the canoe as far as he could for the waves, the other two men Willard & Shannon
had proceeded on down
Capt. Lewis concluded to proceed on by land & find if possible the white people the
Indians say is below and examine if a Bay is Situated near the mouth of this river as
laid down by Vancouver in which we expect, if there is white traders to find them &c.
at 3 oClock he Set out with 4 men Drewyer Jos. & Ru. Fields & R. Frasure, in one of
our large canoes and 5 men to set them around the point on the Sand beech. this
canoe returned nearly filled with water at Dark which it receved by the waves
dashing into it on its return, haveing landed Capt. Lewis & his party Safe on the Sand
beech. The rain &c. which has continued without a longer itermition than 2 hours at a
time for ten days past has distroyd. the robes and rotted nearly one half of the fiew
clothes the party has, perticularley the leather clothes if we have cold weather before
we can kill & Dress Skins for clothing the bulk of the party will Suffer verry much.
NOVEMBER 15TH FRIDAY 1805
Rained all the last night at intervales of sometimes of 2 hours, This morning it
become cold & fair, I prepared to set out at which time the wind sprung up from the
S. E. and blew down the River & in a fiew minits raised such swells and waves
brakeing on the Rocks at the Point as to render it unsafe to proceed. I went to the
point in an empty canoe and found it would be dangerous to proceed even in an
empty canoe The sun shown until 1 oClock P. M. which gave an oppertunity for us to
dry some of our bedding & examine our baggage, the greater Part of which I

Page 285
found wet. some of our Pounded fish spoiled I had all the arms put in order &
amunition examined.
The rainey weather continued without a longer intermition than 2 hours at a time,
from the 5th in the morng. untill the 16th is eleven days rain, and the most
disagreeable time I have experenced confined on a tempiest coast wet, where I can
neither git out to hunt, return to a better situation, or proceed on: in this situation
have we been for Six days past. fortunately the wind lay about 3 oClock we loaded in
great haste and set out passed the blustering Point below which is a sand beech,
with a small marshey bottom for 3 miles on the Stard. Side, on which is a large
village of 36 houses deserted by the Inds & in full possession of the flees, a small
creek fall[s] in at this village, which waters the Country for a few miles back;
Shannon & 5 Indians met me here, Shannon informed me he met Capt. Lewis some
distance below & he took Willard with him & sent him to meet me, the Inds. with him
wer rogues, they had the night before stold both his and Willards guns from under
their heads,8 Capt. Lewis & party arrived at the camp of those Indians at so timely a
period that the Inds. were allarmed & delivered up the guns &c.
The tide meeting of me and the emence swells from the Main Ocian (imedeately in
front of us) raised to such a hite that I concluded to form a camp on the highest spot
I could find in the marshey bottom, and proceed no further by water as the Coaste
becomes verry [dangerous] for crafts of the size of our Canoes, and as the Ocian is
imedeately in front and gives us an extensive view of it from Cape disapointment to
Point addams, except 3 small Islands off the mouth and S W of us. my situation is in
the upper part of Haleys Bay
4 Indians in a canoe came down with papto [wapatoo] roots to sell for which they
asked blankets or robes, both of which we could not spare I informed those Indians
all of which understood some English that if they stole our guns &c the men would
certainly shute them, I treated them with great distance, & the sentinal which was
over our Baggage allarmed them verry much, they all Promised not to take any
things, and if any

Shannon that they should not come near us, and if any one of their nation
Stold anything from us, I would have him Shot, which they understoot verry
well."

verry high Evening fare & pleasent, our men all comfortable in the camps they have
made of the boards they found at the Town above
NOVEMBER 17TH SUNDAY 1805
A fair cool morning wind from the East. The tide rises at this place 8 feet 6 inches
and comes in with great waves brakeing on the Sand beech on which we lay with
great fury Six hunters out this morning in serch of Deer & fowl.
At half past 10 Clock Capt. Lewis returned haveing travesed Haley Bay to Cape
Disapointment and the Sea coast to the North for Some distance. Several Chinnook
Indians followed Capt. L ___, and a Canoe came up with roots mats &c. to Sell.
those Chinnooks made us a present of a rute boiled much resembling the common
liquorice in taste and Size: in return for this root we gave more than double the value
to Satisfy their craveing dispostn. It is a bad practice to receive a present from those
Indians as they are never satisfied for what they recive in return if ten times the
value of the articles they gave. This Chinnook Nation is about 400 Souls inhabid the
countrey on the Small rivers which run into the bay below us and on the Ponds to the
N. W. of us, live principally on fish and roots, they are well armed with fusees and
Sometimes kill Elk Deer and fowl. our hunters killed to day 3 deer, 4 brant and 2
Ducks, and inform me they Saw Some Elk Sign. I directed all the men who wished to
see more of the main Ocian to prepare themselves to Set out with me early on
tomorrow morning. The principal chief of the Chinnooks & his family came up to See
us this evening.
NOVEMBER 18TH MONDAY 1805
I set out with 10 men and my man York to the Ocian by land. i. e. Serjt. Ordway &
Pryor, Jos. & Ru Fields, Go. Shannon, W. Brattin, J. Colter, P. Wiser, W. Labieche &
P. Shabono one of our interpreters & York. I set out at Day light and proceeded on a
Sandy beech
after dinner to a Small rock island in a deep nitch passed a nitch in which there is a
dreen from Some ponds back; the land low opposite this nitch a bluff of yellow clay
and Soft Stone from the river to the commencement of this nitch. below the countrey
rises

Page 287
to high hills of about 80 or 90 feet above the water. at 3 miles passed a nitch. this
rock Island is Small and at the South of a deep bend in which the nativs inform us
the Ships anchor, and from whence they receive their goods in return for their
peltries and Elk skins &c. this appears to be a very good harber for large Ships. here
I found Capt. Lewis name on a tree. I also engraved my name, & by land the day of
the month and year, as also Several of the men.
to the iner extremity of Cape Disapointment passing a nitch in which there is a Small
rock island, a Small Stream falls into this nitch from a pond which is imediately on
the Sea coast passing through a low isthmus. this Cape is an ellivated circlier [cir-]
cular] point covered with thick timber on the iner Side and open grassey exposure
next to the Sea and rises with a Steep assent to the hight of about 150 or 160 feet
above the leavel of the water this cape as also the Shore both on the Bay & Sea
coast is a dark brown rock. I crossed the neck of Land low and 1\2 of a mile wide to
the main Ocian, at the foot of a high open hill projecting into the ocian, and about
one mile in Si[r]cumfrance. I assended this hill which is covered with high corse
grass. decended to the N. of it and camped. [walked] 19 Miles [to-day].
from Cape Disapointment to a high point of a Mountn. which we shall call [Clarke's
Point of View] beares S. 20° W. about 40 [25] miles, point adams is verry low and is
Situated within the derection between those two high points of land, the water
appears verry Shole from off the mouth of the river for a great distance, and I cannot
assertain the direction of the deepest chanel, the Indians point nearest the opposit
Side. the waves appear to brake with tremendious force in every direction quite
across a large Sand bar lies within the mouth nearest to point Adams which is nearly
covered at high tide. men appear much Satisfied with their trip beholding with
estonishment the high waves dashing against the rocks & this emence Ocian

TUESDAY NOVEMBER THE 19TH 1805.
I arose early this morning from under a Wet blanket caused by a Shower of rain
which fell in the latter part of the last night, and

Page 288
Sent two men on a head with directions to proceed on near the Sea Coast and Kill
Something for brackfast and that I should follow my self in about half an hour. after
drying our blankets a little I set out with a view to proceed near the Coast the
direction of which induced me to conclude that at the distance of 8 or 10 miles, the
Bay was at no great distance across. I overtook the hunters at about 3 miles, they
had killed a Small Deer on which we brackfast[ed], it Comen[c]ed raining and
continued moderately until 11 oClock A M.
after takeing a Sumptious brackfast of Venison which was rosted on Stiks exposed to
the fire, I proceeded on through ruged Country of high hills and Steep hollers to the
commencement of a Sandy coast which extended to a point of high land distant near
20 miles. this point I have taken the Liberty of Calling after my particular friend
Lewis. at the commencement of this Sand beech the high lands leave the Sea Coast
in a Direction to Chinnook river, and does not touch the Sea Coast again below point
Lewis leaveing a low pondey Countrey, maney places open with small ponds in which
there is great numbr. of fowl I am informed that the Chinnook Nation inhabit this low
countrey and live in large wood houses on a river which passes through this bottom
Parrilal to the Sea coast and falls into the Bay
I proceeded on the sandy coast and marked my name on a Small pine, the Day of
the month & year, &c. and returned to the foot of the hill, I saw a Sturgeon which
had been thrown on Shore and left by the tide 10 feet in length, and Several joints of
the back bone of a Whale, which must have foundered on this part of the Coast.
after Dineing on the remains of our Small Deer I proceeded to the bay distance about
2 miles, thence up to the mouth of Chinnook river 2 miles, crossed this little river in
the Canoe we left at its mouth and Encamped on the upper Side in an open sandy
bottom.
WEDNESDAY NOVEMBER THE 20TH 1805
Some rain last night dispatched Labeech to kill some fowl for our brackfast he
returned in about 2 hourse with 8 large Ducks on which we brackfast I proceeded on
to the enterance of a Creek near a Cabin. No person being at this Cabin and 2
Canoes laying on the opposit Shore from us, I deturmined to have a raft

Page 289
made and Send a man over for a canoe, a Small raft was Soon made, and Reuben
Fields crossed and brought over a Canoe. This Creek which is the outlet of a number
of ponds, is at this time (high tide) 300 yds. wide. I proceeded on up the Beech and
was overtaken by three Indians one of them gave me Some dried Sturgeon and a
fiew Wappato roots, I employ[e]d those Indians to take up one of our Canoes which
had been left by the first party that Came down, for which Service I gave them each
a fishing hook of a large Size. on my way up I met Several parties of Chinnooks
which I had not before Seen, they were on their return from our Camp. all those
people appeared to know my deturmonation of keeping every individual of their
nation at a proper distance, as they were guarded and resurved in my presence &c.
found maney of the Chin nooks with Capt. Lewis of whome there was 2 Chiefs Com
com mo ly & Chil-lar-la-wil to whome we gave Medals and to one a flag. one of the
Indians had on a roab made of 2 Sea Otter Skins the fur of them were more butifull
than any fur I had ever Seen both Capt. Lewis & my self endeavored to purchase the
roab with different articles at length we precured it for a belt of blue beeds which the
Squar-wife of our interpreter Shabono wore around her waste. in my absence the
hunters had killed Several Deer and fowl of different kinds.
THURSDAY NOVEMBER 21ST 1805
A cloudy morning most of the Chinnooks leave our camp and return home, the Wind
blew hard from the S. E. which with the addition of the flood tide raised verry high
waves which broke with great violence against the shore throwing water into our
camp the forepart of this day Cloudy at 12 oClock it began to rain and continud all
day moderately, Several Indians Visit us to day of different nations or Bands Some of
the Chiltz Nation who reside on the Sea Coast near Point Lewis, Several of the
Clatsops who reside on the Opposit Side of the Columbia imediately opposit to us,
and a Chief from the Grand rapid to whome we gave a Medal.
An old woman & Wife to a Cheif of the Chunnooks came and made a Camp near
ours. She brought with her 6 young Squars (her daughters & nieces) I believe for the
purpose of Gratifying the

Page 290
passions of the men of our party and receving for those indulgiences Such Small
[presents] as She (the old woman) thought proper to accept of.
Those people appear to View Sensuality as a Necessary evel, and do not appear to
abhor it as a Crime in the unmarried State. The young females are fond of the
attention of our men and appear to meet the sincere approbation of their friends and
connections, for thus obtaining their favours, the Womin of the Chinnoook Nation
have handsom faces low and badly made with large legs & thighs which are generally
Swelled from a Stopage of the circulation in the feet (which are Small) by maney
Strands of Beeds or curious Strings which are drawn tight around the leg above the
ankle, their legs are also picked [tattooed] with defferent figures, I saw on the left
arm of a Squar the following letters J. Bowman, all those are considered by the
natives of this quarter as handsom deckerations, and a woman without those
deckorations is Considered as among the lower Class they were their hair lose
hanging over their back and Sholders maney have blue beeds threaded & hung from
different parts of their ears and about ther neck and around their wrists, their dress
otherwise is prosisely like that of the Nation of War ci a cum as already discribed.
Maney of the men have blankets of red blue or Spotted Cloth or the common three &
2 1\2 point9 blankets, and Salors old Clothes which they appear to prise highly, they
also have robes of SeaOtter, Beaver, Elk, Deer, fox and cat common to this
Countrey, which I have never Seen in the U States. they also precure a roabe from
the nativs above, which is made of the Skins of a Small animal about the Size of a
cat, which is light and dureable and highly prized by those people. the greater
numbers of the men of the Chinnooks have Guns and powder and Ball. The Men are
low homely and badly made, Small crooked legs large feet, and all of both Sects
have flattened heads. maney of the Chinnooks appear to have Venerious and
pustelus disorders. one woman whome I saw at the Creek appeared all over in Scabs
and ulsers &c.
9 ''Points'' were lines woven into blankets to denote their size, from one to
four. A four-point Mackinaw measured 72 × 90 inches. The Hudson's Bay
Company four-point today is the full double blanket, 144 inches long. At one
period the blanet cost one beaver pelt per point.

Page 291
We gave to the men each a pece of ribin.10 We purchased cramberies Mats verry
netely made of flags and rushes, Some roots, Salmon and I purchased a hat made of
Splits & Strong grass, which is made in the fashion which was common in the U
States two years ago also small baskets to hold Water made of Split and Straw, for
those articles we gave high prices.

At Fort Clatsop
[Clark] FRIDAY NOVEMBER 22ND 1805.
A moderate rain all the last night with wind, a little before Day light the wind which
was from the S.S.E. blew with Such Violence that we were almost overwhelmed with
water blown from the river, this Storm did not sease at day but blew with nearly
equal violence throughout the whole day accompan[i]ed with rain. O! how horriable
is the day waves brakeing with great violence against the Shore throwing the Water
into our Camp &c. all wet and confind to our Shelters, Several Indian men and
women crouding about the mens shelters to day, we purchased a fiew Wappato
roots for which we gave Armban[d]s, & rings to the old Squar, those roots are equal
to the Irish potato, and is a tolerable substitute for bread
The threat which I made to the men of this nation whome I first Saw, and an
indifference towards them, is: I am fully convinced the cause of their conducting
themselves with great propriety towards ourselves & Party.
SATURDAY NOVEMBER 22[3]RD 1805.
A calm Cloudy morning, a moderate rain the greater part of the last night, Capt.
Lewis Branded a tree with his name Date &c. I marked my name the Day & year on a
alder tree, the party all Cut the first letters of their names on different trees in the
bottom.
in the evening Seven indians of the Clot sop [Clatsop] Nation

Page 293
came over in a Canoe, they brought with them 2 Sea otter Skins for which they
asked blue beads &c. and Such high pricies that we were unable to purchase them
without reducing our Small Stock of Merchendize, on which we depended for
Subcistance on our return up this river. mearly to try the Indian who had one of
those Skins, I offered him my Watch, handkerchief a bunch of red beads and a dollar
of the American coin, all of which he refused and demanded "ti-â-co-mo-shack"
which is Chief beads and the most common blue beads, but fiew of which we have at
this time
The two entries above sound themes that were to be repeated monotonously
through the winter, the rainy season of the Northwest coast and the decadent tribes
who lived near the mouth of the Columbia.
The expedition was encamped on the northern branch of the river, the Washington
shore, which proved to be an acutely unfavorable region. There was little game and
the thought of living on dried fish and flour made from the arrowhead root was
abhorrent, even if there had been enough trade goods to buy them with.
Furthermore, prolonged dampness had rotted the party's clothes, moccasins, and
the robes which were used as blankets, and hides were needed to replace them.
Where should the winter post be built? Clark disliked the seacoast "salt water I view
as an evil in as much as it is not helthy" and would have liked to go back up the
Columbia to The Dalles. That was out of the question, however, for they must not
forfeit whatever chance there was of encountering a ship that was engaged in the
Northwest trade. From such a ship they could replenish their supplies and
equipment and could secure a stock of trade goods for the eastward journey.
(One ship came into the Columbia and passed their campsite on the Washington
shore soon after they abandoned it. The Indians who visited the new post carefully
refrained from telling them of its presence and did not tell the ship's captain that the
expedition was in the vicinity. Jefferson's failure to send a ship to the mouth of the
Columbia is inexplicable.)
Visiting Indians reported that game, especially elk, was more plentiful on the
southern shore. Lewis took a squad to reconnoiter it, finding it a swampy lowland
covered with brush and veined with

Page 294
tidal creeks. There were occasional stands of timber, however, and so many elk that
it was clear there would be no danger of short rations. He selected a site some miles
up a creek he called Netul River now Lewis and Clark River which wandered through
the universal bog. It was "in a thick groth of pine . . . on a rise about 30 feet higher
than the high tides leavel." The main party moved to it on December 7, Clark very
glad to leave the coast where "the sea which is imedeately in front roars like a
repeeted roling thunder and have rored in that way ever since our arrival in its
borders which is now 24 days since we arrived in sight of the Great Western Ocian, I
cant say Pasific as since I have seen it, it has been the reverse." Before leaving he
carved, on a large pine tree, his famous legend, "William Clark December 3rd 1805.
By Land from the U.States in 1804 & 1805."
Here, south of the Columbia and inland from the coast, they built the post which
they named Fort Clatsop for the nearest neighboring tribe. It was a log stockade fifty
feet square, a row of three cabins facing another one of four, with a parade ground
twenty feet wide between them. It was completed on January 1. There were
showers or steady rain every day while it was being built.

at day light this morning we we[re] awoke by the discharge of the fire arm[s] of all

windows, after which they retired to their rooms were chearfull all the morning. after
brackfast we divided our Tobacco which amounted to 12 carrots one half of which
we gave to the men of the party who used tobacco,1 and to those who doe not use
it we make a present of a handkerchief, The Indians leave us in the evening all the

[Lewis] FORT CLATSOP. 1806.
JANUARY 1ST TUESDAY. [WEDNESDAY]
This morning I was awoke at an early hour by the discharge of a volley of small
arms, which were fired by our party in front of our quarters to usher in the new year;
this was the only mark of rispect which we had it in our power to pay this celebrated
day. our repast of this day tho' better than that of Christmass, consisted principally
in the anticipation of the 1st day of January 1807, when in the bosom of our friends
we hope to participate in the mirth and hilarity of the day, and when with the zest
given by the recollection of the present, we shall completely, both mentally and
corporally, enjoy the repast which the hand of civilization has prepared for us. at
present we were content with eating our boiled Elk and wappetoe, and solacing our
thirst with our only beverage pure water. two of our hunters who set out this
morning reterned in the evening having killed two bucks elk; they presented Capt.
Clark and myself each a marrow-bone and tonge, on which we suped. visited today
by a few of the Clatsops who brought some roots and burries for the purpose of
trading with us. we were uneasy with rispect to two of our men, Willard and Wiser,
who were dispatched on the 28th ult. with the salt-makers, and were directed to
return immediately; their not having returned induces us to believe it probable that
they have missed their way. our fourtification being now completed we issued an
order for the more exact and uniform discipline and government of the garrison.

Fort Clatsop was named for a small Chinookan tribe in whose territory it was
located. The Chinooks proper, whose country was also south of the Columbia, and
two other small Chinook-speaking tribes, the Cowlitzes and the Chehalises, whose
country was north

Page 298
of it, were also frequent visitors. All four were fringe tribes of the Northwest Coast
culture, which flourished far more vigorously north of Puget Sound. They flattened
their heads, lived in houses made of wooden planks, were expert watermen, and
had an economy in which the salmon was less central than it was in that of their
northern relatives. They were also less warlike but were very skillful thieves. They
seem to have been declining culturally before white men first saw them but the
decline was accelerated by contact with the new culture. Venereal and other new
diseases had decimated them, and the maritime traders had treated them with
appalling brutality. Lewis and Clark thought much more highly of the Clatsops than
of their neighbors and became very friendly with the chief whose name they
rendered Comowool.
[Clark] FRIDAY THE 3RD JANUARY 1806
At 11 A. M. we were visited by our near neighbour Chief or tiá Co mo wool alias
Conia (Coone *) and six Clatsops. they brought for Sale Some roots berries and 3
Dogs also a Small quantity of fresh blubber. this blubber they informed us they had
obtained from their neighbours the Cal lá mox who inhabit the coast to the S.E. near
one of their Villages a Whale had recently perished. this blubber the Indians eat and
esteem it excellent food. our party from necescity have been obliged to Subsist some
length of time on dogs have now become extreamly fond of their flesh; it is worthey
of remark that while we lived principally on the flesh of this animal we wer much
more helthy strong and more fleshey then we have been Sence we left the Buffalow
Country. as for my own part I have not become reconsiled to the taste of this animal
as yet.3 Send Sarjt. Gass and G. Shannon to the Salt makers who are on the Sea
Coast to the S.W. of us, to enquire after Willard & Wiser who have not yet returned.
R. Field, potts & Collins the hunters who Set out on the 28th ulto., returned this
evening after dark. they reported that they had been about 15 miles up the river
which falls into Merewethers Bay to the East of us, and had hunted the country a
considerable distance to East, and had proved unsucksesfull haveing killed one Deer
and a fiew fowls, bearly as much as Subsisted them. this reminded us of the
necessity of take3 But Lewis: "I have become so perfectly reconciled to the dog that I think it
an agreeable food and would prefer it vastly to lean Venison or Elk."

ing time by the forelock, and keep out Several parties while we have yet a little meat
beforehand. Capt. Lewis gave the Chief Cania a par of Sattin breechies with which he
appeared much pleased.4
[Lewis] SATURDAY JANUARY 4TH 1806.
Comowooll and the Clatsops who visited us yesterday left us in the evening. These
people the Chinnooks and others residing in this neighbourhood and Speaking the
Same language have been very friendly to us; they appear to be a mild inoffensive
people but will pilfer if they have an opportunity to do so where they conceive
themselves not liable to detection. they are great higlers in trade and if they conceive
you anxious to purchase will be a whole day bargaining for a handfull of roots; this I
should have thought proceeded from their want of knowledge of the comparitive
value of articles of merchandize and the fear of being cheated, did I not find that
they invariably refuse the price first offered them and afterwards very frequently
accept a smaller quantity of the same article; in order to satisfy myself on this
subject I once offered a Chinnook my watch two knives and a considerable quantity
of beads for a small inferior sea Otter's skin which I did not much want, he
immediately conceived it of great value, and refused to barter except I would double
the quantity of beads; the next day with a great deal of importunity on his part I
received the skin in exchange for a few strans of the same beads he had refused the
day before. I therefore believe this trait in their character proceeds from an
avaricious all grasping disposition. in this rispect they differ from all Indians I ever
became acquainted with, for their dispositions invariably lead them to give whatever
they are possessed off no matter how usefull or valuable, for a bauble which pleases
their fancy, without consulting it's usefullness or value. nothing interesting occured
today, or more so, than our wappetoe being all exhausted.
SUNDAY JANUARY 5TH 1806.
At 5. P.M. Willard and Wiser returned, they had not been lost as we apprehended.
they informed us that it was not untill the

fifth day after leaving the Fort that they could find a convenient place for making salt;
that they had at length established themselves on the coast about 15 Miles S.W.
from this, near the lodge of some Killamuck families; that the Indians were very
friendly and had given them a considerable quantity of the blubber of a whale which
perished on the coast some distance S.E. of them; part of this blubber they brought
with them, it was white & not unlike the fat of Poork, tho' the texture was more
spongey and somewhat coarser. I had a part of it cooked and found it very pallitable
and tender, it resembled the beaver or the dog in flavour. it may appear somewhat
extraordinary tho' it is a fact that the flesh of the beaver and dog possess a very
great affinity in point of flavour.
These lads also informed us that J. Fields, Bratten and Gibson (the Salt Makers) had
with their assistance erected a comfortable camp killed an Elk and several deer and
secured a good stock of meat; they commenced the making of salt and found that
they could obtain from 3 quarts to a gallon a day; they brought with them a
specemine of the salt of about a gallon, we found it excellent, fine, strong, & white;
this was a great treat to myself and most of the party, having not had any since the
20th Ultmo.; I say most of the party, for my friend Capt. Clark declares it to be a
mear matter of indifference with him whether he uses it or not; for myself I must
confess I felt a considerable inconvenience from the want of it; the want of bread I
consider as trivial provided, I get fat meat, for as to the species of meat I am not
very particular, the flesh of the dog the horse the wolf, having from habit become
equally formiliar with any other, and I have learned to think that if the chord be
sufficiently strong, which binds the soul and boddy together, it dose not so much
matter about the materials which compose it. Capt. Clark determined this evening to
set out early tomorrow with two canoes and 12 men in quest of the whale, or at all
events to purchase from the Indians a parcel of the blubber, for this purpose he
prepared a small assortment of merchandize to take with him.
MONDAY JANUARY 6TH 1806.
Capt Clark set out after an early breakfast with the party in two canoes as had been
concerted the last evening; Charbono and

Page 301
his Indian woman were also of the party; the Indian woman was very impo[r]tunate
to be permited to go, and was therefore in dulged; she observed that she had
traveled a long way with us to see the great waters, and that now that monstrous
fish was also to be seen, she thought it very hard she could not be permitted to see
either (she had never yet been to the Ocean).
The Clatsops, Chinnooks, Killamucks &c. are very loquacious and inquisitive; they
possess good memories and have repeated to us the names capasities of the vessels
&c of many traders and others who have visited the mouth of this river; they are
generally low in stature, proportionably small, reather lighter complected and much
more illy formed than the Indians of the Missouri and those of our frontier; they are
generally cheerfull but never gay. with us their conversation generally turns upon the
subjects of trade, smoking, eating or their women; about the latter they speak
without reserve in their presents, of their every part, and of the most formiliar
connection. they do not hold the virtue of their women in high estimation, and will
even prostitute their wives and daughters for a fishinghook or a stran of beads.5 in
common with other savage nations they make their women perform every species of
domestic drudgery. but in almost every species of this drudgery the men also
participate, their women are also compelled to geather roots, and assist them in
taking fish, which articles form much the greatest part of their subsistance;
notwithstanding the survile manner in which they treat their women they pay much
more rispect to their judgment and oppinions in many rispects than most indian
nations; their women are permitted to speak freely before them, and sometimes
appear to command with a tone of authority; they generally consult them in their
traffic and act in conformity to their opinions.
I think it may be established as a general maxim that those nations treat their old
people and women with most differrence [deference] and rispect where they subsist
principally on such articles that these can participate with the men in obtaining them;
and that, that part of the community are treated with least attention, when the act of
procuring subsistence devolves entirely on the men in the vigor of life. It appears to
me that nature has been much more deficient in her filial tie than in any other of the
strong
5 Clark: ''The Chin-nook womin are lude and carry on sport publickly.''

Page 302
affections of the human heart, and therefore think, our old men equally with our
women indebted to civilization for their ease and comfort. Among the Siouxs,
Assinniboins and others on the Missouri who subsist by hunting it is a custom when
a person of either sex becomes so old and infurm that they are unable to travel on
foot from camp to camp as they rome in surch of subsistance, for the children or
near relations of such person to leave them without compunction or remo[r]se; on
those occasions they usually place within their reach a small peace of meat and a
platter of water, telling the poor old superannuated wretch for his consolation, that
he or she had lived long enough, that it was time they should dye and go to their
relations who can afford to take care of them much better than they could. I am
informed that this custom prevails even among the Minetares Arwaharmays and
Recares when attended by their old people on their hunting excurtions; but in justice
to these people I must observe that it appeared to me at their vilages, that they
provided tolerably well for their aged persons, and several of their feasts appear to
have principally for their object a contribution for their aged and infirm persons.
This day I overhalled our merchandize and dryed it by the fire, found it all damp; we
have not been able to keep anything dry for many days together since we arrived in
this neighbourhood, the humidity of the air has been so excessively great. our
merchandize is reduced to a mear handfull, and our comfort during our return the
next year much depends on it, it is therefore almost unnecessary to add that we
much regret the reduced state of this fund.

Chapter XXII
At Fort Clatsop
[Lewis] MONDAY (TUESDAY) JANUARY 7TH 1806.
Last evening Drewyer visited his traps and caught a beaver and an otter; the beaver
was large and fat we have therefore fared sumptuously today; this we consider a
great prize for another reason, it being a full grown beaver was well supplyed with
the materials for making bate with which to catch others. To prepare beaver bate,
the castor or bark stone is taken as the base, this is gently pressed out of the
bladderlike bag which contains it, into a phiol of 4 ounces with a wide mouth; if you
have them you will put from four to six stone in a phiol of that capacity, to this you
will add half a nutmeg, a douzen or 15 grains of cloves and thirty grains of cinimon
finely pulverized, stir them well together and then add as much ardent sperits to the
composition as will reduce it the consistency [of] mustard prepared for the table;
when thus prepared it resembles mustard precisely to all appearance. when you
cannot procure a phiol a bottle made of horn or a tight earthen vessel will answer, in
all cases it must be excluded from the air or it will soon loose it's virtue; it is fit for
uce immediately it is prepared but becomes much stronger and better in about four
or five days and will keep for months provided it be perfectly secluded from the air.
when cloves are not to be had use double the quantity of Allspice, and when no spice
can be obtained the bark of the root of sausafras. it appears to me that the principal
uce of the spices is only to give a variety to the scent of the bark stone and if so the
mace vineller [vanilla] and other sweet-smelling spices might be employed with
equal advantage.

Page 304
The male beaver has six stones, two [of] which contain a substance much like finely
pulvarized bark of a pale yellow colour and not unlike tanner's ooz in smell, these are
called the bark stones or castors; two others, which like the bark stone resemble
small bladders, containe a pure oil of a strong rank disagreeable smell, and not
unlike train oil, these are called the oil stones; and 2 others of generation. the
Barkstones are about two inc[h]es in length, the others somewhat smaller all are of
a long oval form, and lye in a bunch together between the skin and the root of the
tail, beneath or behind the fundament with which they are closely connected and
seem to communicate. the pride of the female lyes on the inner side much like those
of the hog. they have no further parts of generation that I can perceive and therefore
beleive that like the birds they copulate with the extremity of the gut. The female
have from two to four young ones at a birth and bring fourth once a year only, which
usually happens about the latter end of may and begining of June. at this stage she
is said to drive the male from the lodge, who would otherwise destroy the young.
dryed our lodge and had it put away under shelter; this is the first day during which
we have had no rain since we arrived at this place.
[Clark] TUESDAY 7TH OF JANUARY 1806
Near the base of [a] high Mountain I found our Salt makers, and with them Sergt.
Gass, Geo. Shannon was out in the woods assisting Jo Field and gibson to kill Some
Meat, the Salt Makers had made a Neet close camp, convenient to wood Salt water
and the fresh water of the Clâtsop river which at this place was within 100 paces of
the Ocian. they wer also Situated near 4 houses of Clatsops & Killamox, who they
informed me had been verry kind and attentive to them. I hired a young Indian to
pilot me to the whale for which Service I gave him a file in hand and promised
Several other small articles on my return, left Sergt. gass and one man of my party
Werner to make Salt & permited Bratten to accompany me, we proceeded on the
round Slipery Stones under a high hill which projected into the ocian about 4 miles
further than the direction of the Coast.1 after walking for 2 1\2 miles on the Stones,
1 Tillamook Head.

Page 305
my guide made a Sudin halt, pointed to the top of the mountain and uttered the
word Pe shack which means bad, and made signs that we could not proceed any
further on the rocks, but must pass over that mountain, I hesitated a moment &
view this emence mountain the top of which was obscured in the clouds, and the
assent appeard. to be almost perpindecular; as the small Indian parth allong which
they had brought emence loads but a fiew hours before, led up this mountain and
appeared to assend in a Sideling direction, I thought more than probable that the
assent might be torerably easy and therefore proceeded on, I soon found that the
[path] become much worst as I assended, and at one place we were obliged to
Support and draw our selves up by the bushes & roots for near 100 feet, and after
about 2 hours labour and fatigue we reached the top of this high mountain, from the
top of which I looked down with estonishment to behold the hight which we had
assended, which appeared to be 10 or 12 hundred feet up a mountain which
appeared to be almost perpindicular, here we met 14 Indians men and women
loaded with the Oil and Blubber of the whale. In the face of this tremendeous
precipic[e] imediately below us, there is a stra(tar) of white earth (which my guide
informed me) the neighbouring indians use to paint themselves, and which appears
to me to resemble the earth of which the French Porcelain is made;
[Lewis] TUESDAY (WEDNESDAY) JANUARY 8TH 1806.
The Clatsops Chinnooks and others inhabiting the coast and country in this
neighbourhood, are excessively fond of smoking tobacco. in the act of smoking they
appear to swallow it as they draw it from the pipe, and for many draughts together
you will not perceive the smoke which they take from the pipe; in the same manner
also they inhale it in their lungs untill they become surcharged with this vapour when
they puff it out to a great distance through their nost[r]ils and mouth; I have no
doubt the smoke of the tobacco in this manner becomes much more intoxicating and
that they do possess themselves of all it's virtues in their fullest extent; they
freequently give us sounding proofs of it's creating a dismorallity of order in the
abdomen, nor are those light matters thought indelicate in either sex, but all take the
liberty of

Page 306
obeying the dictates of nature without reserve. these people do not appear to know
the uce of sperituous liquors, they never having once asked us for it; I presume
therefore that the traders who visit them have never indulged them with the uce of
it; from what ever cause this may proceede, it is a very fortunate occurrence, as well
for the natives themselves, as for the quiet and safety of thos whites who visit them.
[Clark] WEDNESDAY 8TH JANUARY 1806
we arived on a butifull Sand Shore, found only the Skelleton of this Monster on the
Sand; the Whale was already pillaged of every Valuable part by the Kilamox Inds. in
the Vecinity of whose village's it lay on the Strand where the waves and tide had
driven up & left it. this Skeleton measured 105 feet. I returned to the Village of 5
Cabins on the creek, found the nativs busily engaged boiling the blubber, which they
performed in a large Squar wooden trought by means of hot stones; the oil when
extracted was secured in bladders and the Guts of the whale; the blubber from which
the oil was only partially extracted by this process, was laid by in their cabins in large
flickes [flitches] for use; those flickes they usially expose to the fire on a wooden
Spit untill it is prutty well wormed through and then eate it either alone or with roots
of the rush, Diped in the oil. The Kil a mox although they possessed large quantities
of this blubber and oil were so prenurious that they disposed of it with great
reluctiance and in small quantities only; insomuch that my utmost exertion aided by
the party with the Small Stock of merchindize I had taken with me were not able to
precure more blubber than about 300 lb. and a fiew gallons of oil; Small as this stock
is I prise it highly; and thank providence for directing the whale to us; and think him
much more kind to us than he was to jonah, having Sent this Monster to be
Swallowed by us in Sted of Swallowing of us as jonah's did.
[Lewis] FRIDAY (THURSDAY) JANUARY 9TH 1806.
The persons who usually visit the entrance of this river for the purpose of traffic or
hunting I believe are either English or Americans; the Indians inform us that they
speak the same language with ourselves, and give us proofs of their varacity by
repeating

Page 307
many words of English, as musquit, powder, shot, [k]nife, file, damned rascal, sun
of a bitch &c. whether these traders are from Nootka sound, from some other late
establishement on this coast, or immediately from the U'States or Great Brittain, I
am at a loss to determine, nor can the Indians inform us. the Indians whom I have
asked in what direction the traders go when they depart from hence, or arrive here,
always point to the S.W. from which it is presumeable that Nootka cannot be their
destination; and as from Indian information a majority of these traders annually visit
them about the beginning of April and remain with them six or seven Months, they
cannot come immediately from Great Britain or the U'States, the distance being too
great for them to go and return in the ballance of the year. from this circumstance I
am sometimes induced to believe that there is some other establishment on the
coast of America south West of this place of which little is but yet known to the
world, or it may be perhaps on some Island in the pacific ocean between the
Continents of Asia and America to the South West of us.2 This traffic on the part of
the whites consists in vending, guns, (principally old british or American musquits)
powder, balls and shot, Copper and brass kettles, brass teakettles and coffee pots,
blankets from two to three point, scarlet and blue Cloth (coarse), plates and strips
and sheet copper and brass, large brass wire, knives, beads and tobacco with
fishinghooks buttons and some other small articles; also a considerable quantity of
Sailor's cloaths, as hats coats, trowsers and shirts. for these they receive in return
from the natives, dressed and undressed Elk-skins, skins of the sea Otter, common
Otter, beaver, common fox, spuck, and tiger cat; also dryed and pounded sammon
in baskets, and a kind of buisquit, which the natives make of roots called by them
shappelell. The natives are extravegantly fond of the most common cheap blue and
white beads, of moderate size, or such that from 50. to 70.
2 From time to time there were temporary trading establishments at Nootka
Sound or near by. But there was nothing like a permanent settlement or post
between Baranov's station on Kodiak Island and the Spanish mission at San
Francisco Bay. This is the only occasion in the Journals when either of the
captains indulges in speculative creation of settlements so common with other
early explorers. It is an inexplicable lapse for Lewis was thoroughly familiar
with the triangular Northwest trade and knew that many ships engaged in it
touched at the Sandwich (Hawaiian) Islands. His speculation that there might
be a "late [recent] establishment" represents a strong anxiety that the British
might have erected a post on which they might base a claim to the Columbia
region.

Page 308
will weigh one penneyweight. the blue is usually p[r]efered to the white; these beads
constitute the principal circulating medium with all the indian tribes on this river; for
these beads they will dispose [of] any article they possess. the beads are strung on
strans of a fathom in length and in that manner sold by the bredth or yard.
[Clark] THURSDAY 9TH OF JANUARY 1806
last night about 10 oClock while Smokeing with the nativ's I was alarmed by a loud
Srill voice from the cabins on the opposite side, the Indians all run immediately
across to the village, my guide who continued with me made Signs that Some one's
throat was Cut, by enquiry I found that one man McNeal was absent, I imediately
Sent off Sergt. N. Pryor & 4 men in quest of McNeal who' they met comeing across
the Creak in great hast, and informed me that the people were alarmed on the
opposit side at Something but what he could not tell, a Man had verry friendly
envited him to go and eate in his lodge, that the Indian had locked armes with him
and went to a lodge in which a woman give him Some blubber, that the man envited
him to another lodge to get Something better, and the woman [Knowing his design]
held him [McNeal] by the blanket which he had around him (He not knowing her
object freed himself & was going off, when [This woman a Chinnook an old friend of
McNeals] and another ran out and hollow'd and his pretended friend disapeared. I
emediately ordered every man to hold themselves in a State of rediness and Sent
Sergt. Pryor & 4 men to know the cause of the alarm which was found to be a
premeditated plan of the pretended friend of McNeal to ass[ass]anate [him] for his
Blanket and what fiew articles he had about him, which was found out by a Chinnook
woman who allarmed the men of the village who were with me in time to prevent the
horred act. this man was of another band at Some distance and ran off as soon as
he was discovered.
SUNDAY THE 12TH JANUARY 1806
This morning Sent out Drewyer and one man to hunt, they returned in the evening
Drewyer haveing killed 7 Elk; I scercely

Page 309
know how we Should Subsist, I beleive but badly if it was not for the exertions of this
excellent hunter; maney others also exert themselves, but not being accquainted
with the best method of finding and killing the elk and no other wild animals is to be
found in this quarter, they are unsucksessfull in their exertions. at 2 P.M. Sergt. Gass
and the men I left to assist the salt makers in carrying in their meat arrived also the
hunters which I directed to hunt in the point, they killed nothing. We have heretofore
devided the Meat when first killed among the four messes, into which we have
divided our party, leaveing to each the care of preserving and distribution of useing
it; but we find that they make such prodigal use of it when they happen to have a
tolerable Stock on hand, that we are determined to adopt a Different System with
our present stock of Seven Elk; this is to jurk it and issue it to them in Small
quantities.
[Lewis] TUESDAY (MONDAY) JANUARY 13TH 1806.
this evening we exhausted the last of our candles, but fortunately had taken the
precaution to bring with us moulds and wick, by means of which and some Elk's
tallow in our possession we do not yet consider ourselves destitute of this necessary
article; the Elk we have killed have a very small portion of tallow.
WEDNESDAY (TUESDAY) JANUARY 14TH 1806.
From the best estimate we were able to make as we d[e]scended the Columbia we
conceived that the natives inhabiting that noble stream, for some miles above the
great falls to the grand rappids inclusive annually prepare about 30,000 lbs. of
pounded sammon for market. but whether this fish is an article of commerce with
the whites or is exclusively sold to, and consumed by the natives of the sea Coast,
we are at a loss to determine. the first of those positions I am disposed to credit
most, but, still I must confess that I cannot imagine what the white merchant's
object can be in purchasing this fish, or where they dispose of it. and on the other
hand the Indians in this neighbourhood as well as the Skillutes have an abundance of
dryed sammon which they take in the creeks and inlets, and I have never seen any
of this pounded fish in their lodges, which I presume would have been the case if
they purchased this pounded fish for their own consumption. the Indians

Page 310
who prepared this dryed and pounded fish, informed us that it was to trade with the
whites, and shewed us many articles of European manufacture which they obtained
for it. it is true they obtain those articles principally for their fish but they trade with
the Skillutes for them and not immediately with the whites; the intermediate
merchants and carryers, the Skillutes, may possibly consume a part of this fish
themselves and dispose of the ballance of it [to] the natives of the sea coast, and
from them obtain such articles as they again trade with the whites.
FRIDAY (THURSDAY) JANUARY 16TH 1806.
we have plenty of Elk beef for the present and a little salt, our houses dry and
comfortable, and having made up our minds to remain until the 1st of April, every
one appears content with his situation and his fare. it is true that we could even
travel now on our return as far as the timbered country reaches, or to the falls of the
river; but further it would be madness for us to attempt to proceede untill April, as
the indians inform us that the snows lye knee deep in the plains of Columbia during
the winter, and in these plains we could scarcely get as much fuel of any kind as
would cook our provision as we descended the river; and even were we happyly over
these plains and again in the woody country at the foot of the Rocky Mountains we
could not possibly pass that immence barrier of mountains on which the snows ly in
winter to the debth in many places of 20 feet; in short the Indians3 inform us that
they are impracticable untill about the 1st of June, at which time even there is an
abundance of snow but a scanty subsistence may be obtained for the horses. we
should not therefore forward ourselves on our homeward journey by reaching the
rocky mountains. early than the 1st of June, which we can easily effect by seting out
from hence on the 1st of April.
TUESDAY (MONDAY) JANUARY 20TH 1806.
Visited this morning by three Clatsops who remained with us all day; the object of
their visit is mearly to smoke the pipe. on the morning of the eighteenth we issued 6
lbs. of jirked Elk pr. man,
3 That is, the Nez Percés.

Page 311
this evening the Sergt. reported that it was all exhausted; the six lbs. have therefore
lasted two days and a half only. at this rate our seven Elk will last us only 3 days
longer, yet no one seems much concerned about the state of the stores; so much for
habit. we have latterly so frequently had our stock of provisions reduced to a
minimum and sometimes taken a small touch of fasting that three days full allowance
excites no concern. In those cases our skill as hunters afford us some consolation,
for if there is any game of any discription in our neighbourhood we can track it up
and kill it. most of the party have become very expert with the rifle. The Indians who
visited us today understood us sufficiently to inform us that the whites did not barter
for the pounded fish; that it was purchased and consumed by the Clatsops,
Chinnooks, Cathlahmahs and Skillutes. The native roots which furnish a considerable
proportion of the subsistence of the indians in our neighbourhood are those of a
species of Thistle, fern, and rush; the Liquorice, and a small celindric root the top of
which I have not yet seen, this last resembles the sweet pittatoe very much in it's
flavor and consistency.

Page 312

Chapter XXIII
At Fort Clatsop
Not any occurences today worthy of notice.'' The sentence appears repeatedly in the
daily log through January, February, and the first half of March 1806. It signalizes
the monotony of life at Fort Clatsop.
Bad weather was continuous. At the end of the winter Clark noted that there had
been only twelve days without rain and only six with sunshine. The garrison settled
down to a routine in which the most exciting activity was the periodic changing of
the detachment that was making salt on the beach at Tillamook Head. Hunting
details were sent out nearly every day; some of them remained away for several
days at a time. These parties provided the staple diet, elk meat, with which
everyone became achingly bored. Occasionally it was varied with other game and
with fresh and dried fish and roots or berries bought from Indians. There were
usually Indians at the fort but their visits became as tiresome as the diet. The sign
language remained the basis of communication but nearly everyone learned a little
Chinook, which was the lingua franca of the maritime trade. And obviously
someone, probably Clark or Drewyer, learned to speak it fairly well.
However hard put to it the captains were to find chores that would keep their
command busy, they themselves were never without occupation. They devoted the
winter to writing up their notes. The results constitute the bulk of this chapter,
which in Volume IV of the Journals runs one hundred and seventy-nine pages.
Almost all of it is Lewis's composition usually Clark's journal is confined to
summarizing or repeating what Lewis had written in his. Lewis's disquisitions are
zoological, botanical, and anthropological

Page 313
describing the fauna, the flora, and the Indians they had seen. He begins with the
immediate locale, the Northwest Coast and the Columbia River. Finishing that he
systematizes and amplifies the observations he had made since leaving Fort
Mandan. The botanical and zoological notes, many of which describe new species or
variations proved valuable to science following the return of the expedition. The
anthropological notes have been permanently important; they are a rich treasury for
ethnologists and historians today.
Meanwhile Clark was reviewing, codifying, and criticizing his geographical data. (His
tables and summaries are in Volume VI of the Journals.) He also drew many
small-scale maps of various localities west of the Great Falls and worked on a series
of master maps. (Many of the former are reproduced in the Atlas Volume of the
Journals.) This activity produced the most important decision of the winter.
Primarily as a result of Clark's study, the captains decided that the route they had
taken west of the Great Falls was neither the shortest nor the best one that they
should have traveled overland and due west to Bitterroot Valley, avoiding the long,
difficult detour to the Three Forks, Lemhi Pass, and the Salmon River. They decided
that when they reached Traveller's Rest (in Bitterroot Valley) on the return journey
they would divide the party. From there Lewis would explore the country which they
believed would provide a better route, going eastward up Hellgate River and down
to the Great Falls by Dearborn or Sun River. Clark would go down the Yellowstone
River, because it too might provide a better route to Bitterroot Valley and because it
was the principal tributary of the Missouri and the terrain it crossed must be
important.
(Representative passages of botanical, zoological, anthropological, and
geographical observation and discussion are printed in the text that follows.)
The inescapable dampness gave nearly everyone colds or rheumatism. A number of
the men had acquired venereal infections, which Lewis treated vigorously. The most
interesting illness, however, was Private Bratton's. He was reported ''very unwell"
on February 10, while at the salt-makers' camp, and was permitted to return to the
fort but was so weak that he had to be carried there in a litter. He "appears much
reduced with his late indisposition but is now

Page 314
recovering fast." On February 15, however, "Bratton is still very weak and complains
of a pain in the lower part of the back when he moves which I supposed proceeds
from dability." (That pain seems the most significant symptom.) On the 19th Clark
gave him "6 of Scotts pills1 which did not work him he is very weak and complains
of his back." The next day he "has an obstenate cough and pain in his back and still
appears to be geting weaker.'' On the 21st Lewis gave him another dose of Scott's
pills and on the 22nd considered him ''on the recovery." But on March 6 (Clark),
"Bratten is now weaker than any of the convalessants and complains verry much of
his back, all of them recovering slowly in consequence of the want of proper diet,
which we have not in our power to procure." On March 7 (Lewis), "Bratton is much
wo[r]se today, he complains of a violent pain in the small of his back and is unable
in consequence to set up. we gave him one of our flanel shirts, applyed a bandage
of flannel to the part and bathed and rubed it well with some vollatile linniment
which I prepared with sperits of wine, camphor, castile soap and a little laudinum.
he felt himself better in the evening." On the 8th "Bratton is much better today, his
back gives him but little pain" but the next day he "complains of his back being very
painfull to him today; I conceive this pain to be something of the rheumatism. we
still apply the linniment and flannel; in the evening he was much better." Nothing
would cure the ailment, however, and after the start of the return journey Bratton
grew much worse. Eventually he was to be cured with dramatic suddenness. The
symptoms and the nature of the cure suggest an inflammation or a sprain of the
sacroiliac joint.2
[Lewis] FRIDAY (THURSDAY) JANUARY 23RD 1806.
This morning dispatched Howard and Warner to the Camp of the Salt-make[r]s for a
supply of salt. The men of the garrison are still busily employed in dressing Elk's
skins for cloathing, they
1 This medicine is not listed in any of the expedition's inventories and I have
been unable to determine what it was. We may confidently assume, however,
that it was a strong purge.
2 One of the medical men I have consulted rejects this diagnosis, however, and
suggests that Bratton's weakness and backache resulted from a severe
abdominal infection suffered at the camp of the salt-makers.

Page 315
find great difficulty for the want of branes;3 we have not soap to supply the
deficiency, nor can we we procure ashes to make the lye; none of the pines which
we use for fuel affords any ashes; extrawdinary as it may seem, the greene wood is
consoomed without leaving the residium of a particle of ashes.
SATURDAY (FRIDAY) JANUARY 24TH 1806.
Drewyer and Baptiest La Paage returned this morning in a large Canoe with
Comowooll and six Clatsops. they brought two deer and the flesh of three Elk & one
Elk's skin, having given the flesh of one other Elk which they killed and three Elk's
skins to the Indians as the price of their assistance in transporting the ballance of the
meat to the Fort; these Elk and deer were killed near point Adams and the Indians
carryed them on their backs about six miles, before the waves were sufficiently low
to permit their being taken on board their canoes. the Indians remained with us all
day. The Indians witnessed Drewyer's shooting some of those Elk, which has given
them a very exalted opinion of us as marksmen and the superior excellence of our
rifles compared with their guns; this may probably be of service to us, as it will deter
them from any acts of hostility if they have ever meditated any such. My Air-gun also
astonishes them very much; they cannot comprehend it's shooting so often and
without powder; and think that it is great medicine which comprehends every thing
that is to them incomprehensible.
TUESDAY (MONDAY) JANUARY 27TH 1806.
Goodrich has recovered from the Louis Veneri which he contracted from an amorous
contact with a Chinnook damsel, I cured him as I did Gibson last winter by the uce of
mercury. I cannot learn that the Indians have any simples which are sovereign
specifics in the cure of this disease; and indeed I doubt very much whet[h]er any of
them have any means of effecting a perfect cure. when once this disorder is
contracted by them it continues with
3 The brains of animals from whose hides robes or clothing were to be made
were used in the tanning process. They were painstakingly rubbed and worked
into the flesh side of the pelt to make it soft and pliable. Other greasy
substances could be substituted, including soap as Lewis suggests. Lye was
used to remove the fur and undercoat.

them during life; but always ends in dec[r]ipitude, death, or premature old age; tho'
from the uce of certain simples together with their diet, they support this disorder
with but little inconvenience for many years, and even enjoy a tolerable share of
health; particularly so among the Chippeways who I believe to be better skilled in the
uce of those simples than any nation of Savages in North America. The Chippeways
use a decoction of the Lobelia, and that of a species of sumac common to the
Atlantic states and to this country near and on the Western side of the Rocky
Mountains. this is the smallest species of the sumac, readily distinguished by it's
winged rib, or common footstalk, which supports it's oppositely pinnate leaves.
these decoctions are drank freely and without limitation. the same decoctions are
used in cases of the gonnaerea and are effecatious and sovereign. notwithstanding
that this disorder dose exist among the Indians on the Columbia yet it is witnessed in
but few individuals, at least the males who are always sufficiently exposed to the
observations or inspection of the phisician. in my whole rout down this river I did not
see more than two or three with the gonnaerea and about double that number with
the pox.
THURSDAY (WEDNESDAY) JANUARY 29TH 1806.
Nothing worthy of notice occurred today. our fare is the flesh of lean elk boiled with
pure water, and a little salt. the whale blubber which we have used very sparingly is
now exhausted. on this food I do not feel strong, but enjoy the most perfect health;
a keen appetite supplys in a great degree the want of more luxurious sauses or
dishes, and still renders my ordinary meals not uninteresting to me, for I find myself
sometimes enquiring of the cook whether dinner or breakfast is ready.
SATURDAY FEBRUARY 1ST 1806.
They [the Indians of the Northwest] have but few axes among them, and the only
tool usually imployed in felling the trees or forming the canoe, carving &c is a chissel
formed of an old file about an Inch or an Inch and a half broad. this chissel has
sometimes a large block of wood for a handle; they grasp the chissel just b[e]low
the block with the right hand holding the edge down while

Page 317
with the left they take hold of the top of the block and strike backhanded against the
wood with the edge of the chissel. a person would suppose that the forming of a
large canoe with an instrument like this was the work of several years; but these
people make them in a few weeks. they prize their canoes very highly; we have been
anxious to obtain some of them, for our journey up the river but have not been able
to obtain one as yet from the natives in this neighbourhood.
today we opened and examined all our ammunition, which had been secured in
leaden canesters. we found twenty seven of the best rifle powder, 4 of common rifle,
th[r]ee of glaized and one of the musqu[e]t powder in good order, perfectly as dry
as when first put in the canesters, altho' the whole of it from various accedents has
been for hours under the water. these cannesters contain four lbs. of powder each
and 8 of lead. had it not have been for that happy expedient which I devised of
securing the powder by means of the lead, we should not have had a single charge
of powder at this time. three of the canesters which had been accedentally bruized
and cracked, one [of] which was carelessly stoped, and a fifth that had been
penetrated with a nail, were a little dammaged; these we gave to the men to make
dry; however exclusive of those five we have an abundant stock to last us back; and
we always take care to put a proportion of it in each canoe, to the end that should
one can[o]e or more be lost we should still not be entirely bereft of ammunition,
which is now our only hope for subsistence and defence in a rout of 4000 Miles
through a country exclusively inhabited by savages.
TUESDAY FEBRUARY 4TH 1806.
There are s[e]veral species of fir in this neighbourhood which I shall discribe as well
as my slender botanical skil wil enable me and for the convenience of comparison
with each other shal number them. (No.1.) a species which grows to immence size;
very commonly 27 feet in the girth six feet above the surface of the earth, and in
several instances we have found them as much as 36 feet in the girth or 12 feet
diameter perfectly solid and entire. they frequently rise to the hight of 230 feet, and
one hundred and twenty or 30 of that hight without a limb. this timber is white and
soft throughout

Page 318
and rives better than any other species we have tryed. the bark shales off in
irregula[r] rounded flakes and is of a redish brown colour particularly of the younger
growth. the stem of this tree is simple branching, ascending, not very defuse, and
proliferous. the leaf of this tree is acerose, 1/10th of an Inh in width, and 3/4 of an
Inch in length; is firm, stif and accuminate; they are triangular, a little declining,
thickly scattered on all sides of the bough, but rispect the three uppersides only and
are also sessile growing from little triangular pedestals of soft spungy elastic bark. at
the junction of the boughs, the bud-scales continued to incircle their rispective twigs
for several year[s]; at least three yea[r]s is common and I have counted as many as
the growth of four years beyond these scales. this tree affords but little rosin. it's
cone I have not yet had an opportunity to discover altho' I have sought it frequently;
the trees of this kind which we have felled have had no cones on them.4
WEDNESDAY FEBRUARY 5TH 1806.
Fir No. 2 is next in dignity in point of size. it is much the most common species, it
may be sa[i]d to constitute at least one half of the timber in this neighbourhood. it
appears to be of the spruse kind. it rises to the hight of 160 to 180 feet very
commonly and is from 4 to 6 feet in diameter, very streight round and regularly
tapering. the bark is thin of a dark colour, and much divided with small longitudinal
intersticies; that of the boughs and young trees is somewhat smoth but not so much
so as the balsom fir nor that of the white pine of our country. the wood is white
throughout and reather soft but very tough, and difficult to rive. The trunk of this
tree is a simple branching diffused stem and not proliferous as the pines & firs usially
are but like most other trees it puts forth buds from the sides of the small boughs as
well as their extremities. the stem usually terminates in a very slender pointed top
like the cedar. The leaves are petiolate, the footstalk small short and oppressed;
acerose reather more than half a line in width and very unequal in length, the
greatest length being little more than half an inch, while others intermixed on every
part of the bough are not more than a 1/4 in length. flat with a small longitudinal
channel in the

Page 319
upper disk which is of a deep green and glossy, while the u[n]der disk is of a
whiteish green only; two ranked, obtusely pointed, soft and flexable. this tree affords
but little rosin. the cone is remarkably small not larger than the end of a man's
thumb soft, flexable and of an ovate form, produced at the ends of the small twigs.5
FRIDAY FEBRUARY 7TH 1806.
This evening we had what I call an excellent supper it consisted of a marrowbone a
piece and a brisket of boiled Elk that had the appearance of a little fat on it. this for
Fort Clatsop is living in high stile.
In this neighbourhood I observe the honeysuckle common in our country I first met
with it on the waters of the Kooskooske near the Chopunnish nation, and again
below the grand rappids In the Columbian Valley on tide-water. The Elder also
common to our country grows in great abundance in the rich woodlands on this side
of the rocky Mountains; tho' it differs here in the colour of it's berry, this being of a
pale sky blue while that of the U' States is a deep perple. The seven bark or nine
bark as it is called in the U'States is also common in this quarter. There is a species
of huckleberry common to the piny lands from the commencement of the Columbian
valley to the seacoast; it rises to the hight of 6 or 8 feet. is a simple branching
somewhat defuse stem; the main body or trunk is cilindric and of a dark brown,
while the colateral branches are green smooth, squar, and put forth a number of
alternate branches of the same colour and form from the two horizontal sides only.
the fruit is a small deep perple berry which the natives inform us is very good. the
leaf is thin of a pale green and small being 3/4 of an inch in length and 3/8 in width;
oval terminateing more accutely at the apex than near the insertion of the footstalk
which is at the base; [veined, nearly] entire, serrate but so slightly so that it is
scarcely perceptible; footstalk short and there position with rispect to each other is
alternate and two ranked, proceeding from the horizontal sides of the bough only.
The small pox has distroyed a great number of the natives in this quarter. it prevailed
about 4 years since among the Clatsops and destroy[ed] several hundred of them,
four of their chiefs fell victyms
5 The mountain nemlock, Tsuga mertensiana.

Page 320
to it's ravages. those Clatsops are deposited in their canoes on the bay a few miles
below us. I think the late ravages of the small pox may well account for the number
of remains of vilages which we find deserted on the river and Sea coast in this
quarter.
WEDNESDAY FEBRUARY 12TH 1806.
This morning we were visited by a Clatsop man who brought with him three dogs as
a remuneration for the Elk which himself and nation had stolen from us some little
time since, however the dogs took alarm and ran off; we suffered him to remain in
the fort all night.
THURSDAY FEBRUARY 13TH 1806
yesterday we completed the operation of drying the meat, and think we have a
sufficient stock to last us this month. the Indians inform us that we shall have great
abundance of a small fish in March which from their discription must be the herring.
these people have also informed us that one [Captain] More who sometimes touches
at this place and trades with the natives of this coast, had on board of his vessel
three Cows, and that when he left them he continued his course along the N.W.
coast. I think this strong circumstancial proof that there is a stettlement of white
persons at Nootka sound or some point to the N.W. of us on the coast.
[Clark] FRIDAY FEBRUARY 14TH 1806
I compleated a map of the Countrey through which we have been passing from the
Mississippi at the Mouth of Missouri to this place. In the Map the Missouri Jefferson's
river the S.E. branch of the Columbia or Lewis's river, Koos-koos-ke and Columbia
from the enterance of the S.E. fork to the pacific Ocian, as well as a part of Clark's
river [the Bitterroot] and our track across the Rocky Mountains are laid down by
celestial observations and survey. the rivers are also conected at their sources with
other rivers agreeably to the information of the nativs and the most probable
conjecture arrising from their capacities and the relative positions of their respective
enterances which last have with but fiew exceptions been established by celestial
observations.
We now discover that we have found the most practicable and

Page 321
navigable passage across the Continent of North America; it is that which we have
traveled with the exception of that part of our rout from the foot of the Falls of the
Missouri, or in neighbourhood of the enterance of the Rocky Mountains untill we
arive on Clarks river at the enterence of Travelers-rest Creek; the distance between
those two points would be traveled more advantagiously by land as the navigation of
the Missouri above the Falls is crooked laborious and 521 miles distant, by which no
advantage is gained as the rout which we are compelled to travel by land from the
source of Jeffersons River to the enterance of Travellers rest Creek is 220 miles,
being further by abt 600 miles than that from the Falls of the Missourie to the last
mentioned point (Travellers rest Creek) and a much worse rout if indian information
is to be relied on which is from the Sosonee or Snake Indians, and the Flatheads of
the Columbia West of the rocky mountains.6
from the same information Clarks river like that of the S. E. branch of the Columbia
which heads with Jefferson's and Maddisons river's can not be navagated thro' the
rocky mountains in consequence of falls and rapids, and as a confirmation of the
fact, we discovered that there were no salmon in Clark's river, which is not the case
in the S.E. branch of the Columbia altho it is not navigable. added to this, the Indians
of different quarte[r]s further inform us, that Clark's river runs in the direction of the
Rocky Mountains for a great distance to the north before it discharges itself into the
Columbia river. from the same information the Columbia from the enterance of the S.
E. branch to the enterance of Clark's river is obstructed with a great number of
deficuelt and dangerous rapids (and the place Clark's river comes out of the Rocky
Mountains is a tremendious fall &c which there is no possibility of passing the
mountains either by land or water.) considering therefore the dangers and
deficuelties attending the navigation of the Columbia in this part, as well as the
circuitous and distant rout formed by itself and that of Clark's River we conceive that
even admitting that Clarks river contrary to information to be as navagable as the
Columbia below its enterance, that the tract by land over the Rocky Mountains
usually traveled by the nativs from the enterance of Travellers-rest Creek to the
Forks of the Kooskooske is preferable; the same being a distance of 184 miles.
6 They met one band of Salishan (Flathead) people west of the mountains, but
Clark probably means Nez Percés here.

Page 322
The inferrence therefore deduced from these premises are, that the best and most
practicable rout across the Continent is by way of the Missouri to the Falls; thence to
Clarks river at the enterance of Travellers rest Creek, from thence up travillers rest
Creek to the forks, from whence you prosue a range of mountains which divides the
waters of the two forks of this Creek, and which still Continues it's westwardly
course on the Mountains which divides the waters of the two forks of the Kookooske
river to their junction; from thence to decend this river to the S. E. branch of the
Columbia, thence down that river to the Columbia, and down the Latter to the Pacific
Ocian. There is a large river which falls into the Columbia on its south side at what
point we could not lern; which passes thro those extencive Columbian Plains from
the South East, and as the Indians inform us head in the Mountains South of the
head of Jefferson River and at no great distance from the Spanish settlements,
Multnomah and that that fork which heads with the River Rajhone and waters of the
Missouri passes through those extensive plains in which there is no wood, and the
river crowded with rapids & falls many of which are impassable.7 the other or
westerly fork passes near a range of mountains and is the fork [on] which [live]
great numbers of Indian Bands of the Sosone or Snake Indians this fork most
probably heads with North River or the waters of Callifornia. this River may afford a
practicable land communication with New Mexico by means of its western fork. This
river cannot be navagable as an impracticable rapid is within one mile of its
enterance into the Columbia, and we are fully purswaded that a rout by this river if
practicable at all, would lengthen the distance greatly and incounter the same
dificulties in passing the Rocky Mountains with the rout by way of Travellers rest
Creek & Clarks river.

The quadrupeds of this country from the Rocky Mountains to the pacific Ocean are

7 He has learned about the Willamette River since passing its mouth. He has
assimilated to it some data which actually relate to the main stream of the
Snake River. The "other or westerly fork" mentioned in the next sentence
comes close to describing the Willamette, though it does not reach "the waters
of Callifornia." That either the Snake or the Willamette provides access to the
New Mexican settlements is a gross error. These misconceptions fastened on
American cartography for fifty years a nonexistent river called the Multnomah.

difference in point of colour) the black bear, the common red deer, the black tailed
fallow deer, the Mule deer, Elk, the large brown wolf, the small woolf of the plains,
the large wolf of the plains, the tiger cat, the common red fox, black fox or fisher,
silver fox, large red fox of the plains, small fox of the plains or kit fox, Antelope,

rat, mouse, mole, Panther, hare, rabbit, and polecat or skunk. all of which shall be
severally noticed in the order in which they occur as well as shuch others as I learn
do exist and which [have] not been here recapitulated.
The horse is confined principally to the nations inhabiting the great plains of
Columbia extending from Latitude 40° to 50° N. and occupying the tract of country
lying between the rocky Mountains and a range [Cascade] of Mountains which pass
the Columbia river about the great falls or from Longitude 116 to 121 West. in this
exte[n]sive tract of principally untimbered country so far as we have lea[r]nt the
following natives reside (viz) the Sosone or snake Indians, the Chopunnish, Sokulks,
Cutssahnims, Chymnapums, E[c]helutes, Eneshuh & Chilluckkittequaws. all of whom
enjoy the bennefit of that docile, generous and valuable anamal the horse, and all of
them except the three last have immence numbers of them. Their horses appear to
be of an excellent race; they are lofty eligantly formed active and durable; in short
many of them look like the fine English coarsers and would make a figure in any
country. some of those horses are pided [pied] with large spots of white irregularly
scattered and intermixed with the black brown bey or some other dark colour, but
much the larger portion are of an uniform colour with stars snips and white feet, or
in this rispect marked much like our best blooded horses in virginia, which they
resemble as well in fleetness and bottom as in form and colours. the natives suffer
them to run at large in the plains, the grass of which furnishes them with the only
subsistence their masters taking no trouble to lay in a winters store for them, but
they even keep fat if not much used on the dry grass of the plains during the winter.
no rain scarcely ever falls in these plains and the grass is short and but thin. The
natives (except those near the R. Monts) appear to

Page 324
take no pains in scelecting their male horses from which they breed, in short those of
that discription which I have noticed appeared much the most indifferent.
whether the horse was orrigeonally a native of this country or not it is out of my
power to determine as we cannot understand the language of the natives sufficiently
to ask the question. at all events the country and climate appears well adapted to
this anamal. horses are said to be found wild in many parts of this extensive plain
country. the several tribes of Sosones who reside towards Mexico on the waters of
[the Multnomah] river or particularly one of them called Shâ-bo-bó-ah have also a
great number of mules, which among the Indians I find are much more highly prized
than horses. an eligant horse may be purchased of the natives in this country for a
few beads or other paltry trinkets which in the U'States would not cost more than
one or two dollars. This abundance and cheapness of horses will be extremely
advantageous to those who may hereafter attem[p]t the fir trade to the East Indies
by way of the Columbia river and the Pacific Ocean. the mules in the possession of
the Indians are principally stolen from the Spaniards of Mexeco; they appear to be
large and fine such as we have seen. Among the Sosones of the upper part of the S.
E. fork of the Columbia we saw several horses with spanish brands on them which
we supposed had been stolen from the inhabitants of Mexeco.
THURSDAY FEBRUARY 20TH 1806.
This forenoon we were visited by Tâh-cum a principal Chief of the Chinnooks and 25
men of his nation. we had never seen this cheif before he is a good looking man of
about 50 years of age reather larger in statu[r]e than most of his nation; as he came
on a friendly visit we gave himself and party something to eat and plyed them
plentifully with smoke. we gave this cheif a small medal with which he seemed much
gratifyed. in the evening at sunset we desired them to depart as is our custom and
closed our gates. we never suffer parties of such number to remain within the fort all
night; for notwithstanding their apparent friendly disposition, their great averice and
hope of plunder might induce them to be treacherous. at all events we determined
allways to be on our guard as

Page 325
much as the nature of our situation will permit us, and never place ourselves at the
mercy of any savages. we well know, that the treachery of the aborigenes of America
and the too great confidence of our countrymen in their sincerity and friendship, has
caused the distruction of many hundreds of us. so long have our men been
accustomed to a friendly intercourse with the natives, that we find it difficult to
impress on their minds the necessity of always being on their guard with rispect to
them. this confidence on our part, we know to be the effect of a series of
uninterupted friendly intercou[r]se, but the well known treachery of the natives by
no means entitle them to such confidence, and we must check it's growth in our own
minds, as well as those of our men, by recollecting ourselves, and repeating to our
men that our preservation depends on never loosing sight of this trait in their
character, and being always prepared to meet it in whatever shape it may present
itself.
SATURDAY FEBRUARY 22ED 1806.
We were visited today by two Clatsop women and two boys who brought a parsel of
excellent hats made of Cedar bark and ornamented with beargrass. two of these hats
had been made by measures which Capt. Clark and myself had give one of the
women some time since with a request to make each of us a hat; they fit us very
well, and are in the form we desired them. we purchased all their hats and
distributed them among the party. the woodwork and sculpture of these people as
well as these hats and their waterproof baskets evince an ingenuity by no means
common among the Aborigenes of America. in the evening they returned to their
village and Drewyer accompanied them in their canoe in order to get the dogs which
the Clatsops have agreed to give us in payment for the Elk they stole from us some
weeks since. these women informed us that the small fish began to run which we
suppose to be herring from their discription. they also informed us that their Chief
Conia or Comowooll, had gone up the Columbia to the valley in order to purchase
wappetoe, a part of which he intended trading with us on his return.
one of our canoes brake the cord by which it was attatched and was going off with
the tide this evening; we sent Sergt. Pryor and a party after her who recovered and
brought her back. our sick

Page 326
consisting of Gibson, Bratton, Sergt. Ordway, Willard and McNeal are all on the
recovery. we have not had as ma[n]y sick at any one time since we left Wood River.
the general complaint seams to be colds and fevers, something I believe of the
influenza.
SUNDAY FEBRUARY 23RD 1806.
The Sea Otter is found on the sea coast and in the salt water. this anamal when fully
grown is as large as a common mastive dog. the ears and eyes are remarkab[l]y
small, particularly the former which is not an inch in length thick fleshey and pointed
covered with short hair. the tail is about 10 inches in length thick where it joins the
body and tapering to a very sharp point; in common with the body it is covered with
a deep fur particularly on the under part the fur is not so long. the legs are
remarkably short and the feet which have five toes each are broad large and
webbed. the legs are covered with fur and the feet with short hair. the body of this
animal is long and nearly of the same thickness throughout. from the extremity of
the tail to that of the nose they will measure 5 feet or upwards. the colour is a
uniform dark brown and when in good order and season perfectly black and glossey.
it is the riches[t] and I think the most delicious fur in the world at least I cannot form
an idea of any more so. it is deep thick silkey in the extreem and strong. the inner
part of the fur when opened is lighter than the surface in it's natural position. there
are some fine black and shining hairs intermixed with the fur which are reather
longer and add much to it's beauty. the nose, about the eyes ears and forehead in
some of these otter is of a lighter colour, sometimes a light brown. those parts in the
young sucking Otter of this species is sometimes of a cream coloured white, but
always much lighter than the other parts. the fur of the infant Otter is much inferior
in point of colour and texture to that of the full grown otter, or even after it has been
weaned. there is so great a difference that I have for some time supposed it a
different animal; the Indians called the infant Otter Spuck, and the full grow[n] or
such as had obtained a coat of good fur, E-luck'-ke. this still further confirmed the
opinion of their being distinct species; but I have since learned that the Spuck is the
young Otter. the colour of the neck, body, legs and tail is a dark lead brown.

Page 327
[Clark] TUESDAY FEBRUARY 25TH 1806
I purchased of the Clatsops this morning about half a bushel of small fish which they
had cought about 40 miles up the Columbia in their scooping nets. the rays of the
fins are boney but not sharp tho' somewhat pointed. the small fin on the back next
to the tail has no rays of bone being a thin membranous pellicle. the fins next to the
gills have eleven rays each. those of the abdomen have Eight each, those of the
pinna ani are 20 and 2 half formed in front. that of the back has eleven rays. all the
fins are of a white colour. the back is of a blueish duskey colour and that of the lower
part of the sides and belly is of a silvery white. no spots on any part. the first gills
next behind the eye is of a blueish cast, and the second of a light gold colour nearly
white. the puple of the eye is black and the iris of a silver white. the under jaw
exceeds the upper; and the mouth opens to a great extent folding like that of the
Herring. it has no teeth. the abdomen is obtuse and smooth, in this differing from
the herring, shad, anchovey &c. of the Malacapterygious order and class clupea, to
which however I think it more nearly allyed than to any other altho' it has not their
accute and serrate abdomen and the under jaw exceeding the upper. the scales of
this little fish are so small and thin that without manute inspection you would
suppose they had none. they are filled with roes of a pure white colour and have
scercely any perceptable alimentary duct.
I found them best when cooked in Indian stile, which is by rosting a number of them
together on a wooden spit without any previous preparation whatever. they are so
fat that they require no aditional sauce, and I think them superior to any fish I ever
tasted, even more delicate and lussious than the white fish of the Lakes which have
heretofore formed my standard of excellence among the fishes. I have herd the fresh
anchovey much extoll'd but I hope I shall be pardoned for believing this quite as
good. the bones are so soft and fine that they form no obstruction in eating this
fish.8
TUESDAY 11TH OF MARCH 1806
The Mule Deer we have never found except in rought country; they prefer the Open
Grounds and are seldom found in the wood
8 This is the candlefish or eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus), second only to
the salmon in the economy of the Northwest Indians.

Page 328
lands near the river; when they are met with in the wood lands or river boottoms
and pursued, they imediately run to the hills or open country as the Elk do, the
contrary happens with the common Deer. there are several differences between the
Mule and common deer as well as in form as in habits. they are fully a third larger in
general, and the male is particularly large; think there is somewhat greater disparity
of size between the Male and the female of this Species than there is between the
male and female fallow Deer; I am convinced I have seen a Buck of this species
twice the volume [of] a Buck of the common Deer. the Ears are peculiarly large, I
measured those of a large Buck which I found to be eleven inches long and 3 1\2 in
width at the widest part; they are not so delicately formed, their hair in winter is
thicker longer and of a much darker grey, in Summer the hair is still coarser longer
and of a paler red, more like that of the Elk, in winter they also have a considerable
quantity of very fine wool intermixed with the hair and lying next to the skin as the
Antelope has. the long hair which grows on the outer side of the first joint of the hind
legs, and which in the common Deer do not usially occupy more than 2 inches in
them occupy from 6 to 8; their horns also differ, those in the common deer consist
of two main beams gradually deminishing as the points proceed from it, with the
Mule deer the horns consist of two beams which at the distance of 4 or 6 inches from
the head divide themselves into two equal branches which again either divide into
two other equal branches or terminate in a smaller, and two equal ones; haveing
either 2, 4 or 6 points on a beam; the horn is not so rough about the base as the
common deer, and are invariably of a much darker colour. the most striking
difference of all, is the white rump and tail. from the root of the tail as a center there
is a circular spot perfectly white of about 3 1\2 inches radius, which occupy a part of
the rump and the extremities of buttocks and joins the white of the belley
underneath; the tail which is usially from 8 to 9 inches long for the first 4 or 5 inches
from its upper extremity is covered with short white hairs, much shorter indeed than
those hairs of the body; from hence for about one inch further, the hair is still white
but gradually becoms longer the tail then termonates in a tissue of Black hair of
about 3 inches long. from this black hair of the tail they have obtained among the
French engages the appelation of the black tailed Deer,

Page 329
but this I conceive by no means characteristic of the Animal as much the larger
portion of the tail is white. the Ears and the tail of this Animale when compared with
those of the Common Deer, so well comported with those of the Mule when
compared with the Horse, that we have by way of distinction adapted the appellation
of the Mule Deer which I think much more appropriate. on the inner corner of each
eye there is a drane (like the Elk) or large recepticle which seams to answer as a
drane to the eye which gives it the appearance of weeping, this in the Common Deer
of the Atlantic States is scercely proceptable but becoms more conspicious in the
fallow Deer, and still more so in the Elk; this recepticle in the Elk is larger than any of
the Pecora order with which I am acquainted.
[Lewis] SATURDAY MARCH 15TH 1806.
This morning at 11.OCk. the hunters arrived, having killed four Elk only. Labuish it
seems was the only hunter who fell in with the Elk and having by some accedent lost
the fore sight of his gun shot a great number of times but killed only the number
mentioned. as the elk were scattered we sent two parties for them, they returned in
the evening with four skins and the flesh of three Elk, that of one of them having
become putrid from the liver and pluck haveing been carelessly left in the animal all
night.
we were visited this afternoon by Delashshelwilt a Chinnook Chief his wife and six
women of his nation which the old baud his wife had brought for market. this was
the same party that had communicated the venerial to so many of our party in
November last, and of which they have finally recovered. I therefore gave the men a
particular charge with rispect to them which they promised me to observe. late this
evening we were also visited by Catel a Clatsop man and his family. he brought a
canoe and a Sea Otter Skin for sale neither of which we purchased this evening. The
Clatsops who had brought a canoe for sale last evening left us early this morning.
SUNDAY MARCH 16TH 1806.
Drewyer and party did not return from the Cathlahmahs this evening as we
expected. we suppose he was detained by the hard

Page 330
winds of today. the Indians remained with us all day, but would not dispose of their
canoes at a price which it was in our power to give consistently with the state of our
Stock of Merchandize. two handkerchiefs would now contain all the small articles of
merchandize which we possess; the ballance of the stock consists of 6 blue robes
one scarlet do. one uniform artillerist's coat and hat. five robes made of our large
flag, and a few old cloaths trimed with ribbon. on this stock we have wholy to
depend for the purchase of horses and such portion of our subsistence from the
Indians as it will be in our powers to obtain.
MONDAY MARCH 17TH 1806.
Old Delashelwilt and his women still remain they have formed a ca[m]p near the fort
and seem to be determined to lay close s[i]ege to us but I believe notwithstanding
every effort of their wining graces, the men have preserved their constancy to the
vow of celibacy which they made on this occasion to Capt. C. and myself. we have
had our perogues prepared for our departure, and shal set out as soon as the
weather will permit. the weather is so precarious that we fear by waiting untill the
first of April that we might be detained several days longer before we could get from
this to the Cathlahmahs as it must be calm or we cannot accomplish that part of our
rout. Drewyer returned late this evening from the Cathlahmahs with our canoe which
Sergt. Pryor had left some days since, and also a canoe which he had purchased
from those people. for this canoe he gave my uniform laced coat and nearly half a
carrot of tobacco. it seems that nothing excep[t] this coat would induce them to
dispose of a canoe which in their mode of traffic is an article of the greatest val[u]e
except a wife, with whom it is equal, and is generally given in exchange to the father
for his daughter. I think the U'States are indebted to me another Uniform coat for
that of which I have disposed on this occasion was but little woarn. we yet want
another canoe, and as the Clatsops will not sell us one at a price which we can afford
to give we will take one from them in lue of the six Elk which they stole from us in
the winter.

Chapter XXIV
The Start for Home
[Lewis] TUESDAY MARCH 18TH 1806.
Drewyer was taken last night with a violent pain in his side. Capt. Clark blead him.
several of the men are complaining of being unwell. it is truly unfortunate that they
should be sick at the moment of our departure. we directed Sergt. Pryor to prepare
the two Canoes which Drewyer brought last evening for his mess. they wanted some
knees to strengthen them and several cracks corked and payed. he completed them
except the latter operation which the frequent showers in the course of the day
prevented as the canoes could not be made sufficiently dry even with the assistance
of fire. Comowooll and two Cathlahmahs visited us today; we suffered them to
remain all night. this morning we gave Delashelwilt a certificate of his good
deportment &c. and also a list of our names, after which we dispatched him to his
village with his female band. These lists of our names we have given to several of the
natives and also paisted up a copy in our room. the object of these lists we stated in
the preamble of the same as follows (viz) ''The object of this list is, that through the
medium of some civilized person who may see the same, it may be made known to
the informed world, that the party consisting of the persons whose names are
hereunto annexed, and who were sent out by the government of the U'States in May
1804. to explore the interior of the Continent of North America, did penetrate the
same by way of the Missouri and Columbia Rivers, to the discharge of the latter into
the Pacific Ocean, where they arrived on the 14th of November 1805, and from
whence they departed the [blank space in MS.] day

Page 332
of March 1806 on their return to the United States by the same rout they had come
out.'' on the back of some of these lists we added a sketch of the connection of the
upper branches of the Missouri with those of the Columbia, particularly of it's main
S.E. branch, on which we also delineated the track we had come and that we meant
to pursue on our return where the same happened to vary. There seemed so may
chances against our government ever obtaining a regular report, through the
medium of the savages and the traders of this coast that we declined making any.
our party are also too small to think of leaving any of them to return to the U'States
by sea, particularly as we shall be necessarily divided into three or four parties on
our return in order to accomplish the objects we have in view; and at any rate we
shall reach the United States in all human probability much earlier than a man could
who must in the event of his being left here depend for his passage to the United
States on the traders of the coast who may not return immediately to the U'States or
if they should, might probably spend the next summer in trading with the natives
before they would set out on their return. this evening Drewyer went in quest of his
traps, and took an Otter.
WEDNESDAY MARCH 19TH 1806.
It continued to rain and hail today in such manner that nothing further could be done
to the canoes. The Killamucks, Clatsops, Chinnooks, Cathlahmahs and Wâc-kia-cums resemble each other as well in their persons and dress as in their habits and
manners. their complexion is not remarkable, being the usual copper brown of most
of the tribes of North America. they are low in statu[r]e reather diminutive, and illy
shapen; poss[ess]ing thick broad flat feet, thick ankles, crooked legs wide mouths
thick lips, nose moderately large, fleshey, wide at the extremity with large nostrils,
black eyes and black coarse hair. their eyes are sometimes of a dark yellowish brown
the puple black. the most remarkable trait in their physiognomy is the peculiar
flatness and width of forehead which they artificially obtain by compressing the head
between two boards while in a state of infancy and from which it never afterwards
perfectly recovers. this is a custom among all the nations we have met with West of
the Rocky mountains. I have observed the

Page 333
heads of many infants, after this singular bandage had been dismissed, or about the
age of 10 or eleven months, that were not more than two inches thick about the
upper edge of the forehead and reather thiner still higher. from the top of the head to
the extremity of the nose is one streight line. this is done in order to give a greater
width to the forehead, which they much admire. this process seems to be continued
longer with their female than their mail children, and neither appear to suffer any
pain from the operation. it is from this peculiar form of the head that the nations East
of the Rocky mountains, call all the nations on this side, except the Aliohtans or
snake Indians, by the generic name of Flatheads.
the large or apparently swolen legs particularly observable in the women are
obtained in a great measure by tying a cord tight around the ankle. their method of
squating or resting themselves on their hams which they seem from habit to prefer
to siting, no doubt contributes much to this deformity of the legs by preventing free
circulation of the blood.
the dress of the man consists of a smal robe, which reaches about as low as the
middle of the thye and is attached with a string across the breast and is at pleasure
turned from side to side as they may have occasion to disencumber the right or left
arm from the robe entirely, or when they have occasion for both hands, the fixture of
the robe is in front with it's corners loosly hanging over their arms. a mat is
sometimes temperarily thrown over the sholders to protect them from rain. they
have no other article of cloathing whatever neither winter nor summer. and every
part except the sholders and back is exposed to view. they are very fond of the
dress of the whites, which they wear in a similar manner when they can obtain them,
except the shoe which I have never seen woarn by any of them.
The dress of the women consists of a robe, tissue, and sometimes when the weather
is uncommonly cold, a vest. their robe is much smaller than that of the men, never
reaching lower than the waist nor extending in front sufficiently for to cover the
body. it is like that of the men confined across the breast with a string and hangs
loosly over the sholders and back. the most esteemed and valuable of these robes
are made of strips of the skins of the Sea Otter net together with the bark of the
white cedar or silk-grass. these strips are first twisted and laid parallel with each
other a little distance

Page 334
assunder, and then net or wove together in such a manner that the fur appears
equally on both sides, and unites between the strands. it make[s] a warm and soft
covering. other robes are formed in a similar manner of the skin of the Rackoon,
beaver &c. at other times the skin is dressed in the hair and woarn without any
further preperation. the vest is always formed in the manner first discribed of their
robes and covers the body from the armpits to the waist, and is confined behind,
and destitute of straps over the sholder to keep it up. when this vest is woarn the
breast of the woman is concealed. but without it which is almost always the case,
they are exposed, and from the habit of remaining loose and unsuspended grow to
great length, particularly in aged women in many of whom I have seen the bubby
reach as low as the waist. The garment which occupys the waist, and from thence as
low as nearly to the knee before and the ham, behind, cannot properly be
denominated a petticoat, in the common acceptation of that term; it is a tissue of
white cedar bark, bruised or broken into small shreds, which are interwoven in the
middle by means of several cords of the same materials, which serve as well for a
girdle as to hold in place the shreds of bark which form the tissue, and which shreds
confined in the middle hang with their ends pendulous from the waist, the whole
being of sufficient thickness when the female stands erect to conceal those parts
usually covered from formiliar view, but when she stoops or places herself in many
other attitudes, this battery of Venus is not altogether impervious to the inquisitive
and penetrating eye of the amorite.
The favorite ornament of both sexes are the common coarse blue and white beads
which the men wear tightly wound aro[u]nd their wrists and ankles many times untill
they obtain the width of three or more inches. they also wear them in large rolls
loosly arond the neck, or pendulous from the cartelage of the nose or rims of the
ears which are purforated for the purpose. the women wear them in a similiar
manner except in the nose which they never purforate. they are also fond of a
species of wampum which is furnished them by a trader whom they call Swipton. it
seems to be the native form of the shell without any preperation. the men
sometimes wear collars of bears claws, and the women and children the tusks of the
Elk variously arranged on their necks arms &c. both males and females wear braslets
on their wrists of copper brass or Iron in various forms.

Page 335
THURSDAY MARCH 20TH 1806.
It continued to rain and blow so violently today that nothing could be done towards
forwarding our departure. we intended to have Dispatched Drewyer and the two
Fieldses to hunt near the bay on this side of the Cathlahmahs untill we jounded
[joined] them from hence, but the rain rendered our departure so uncertain that we
declined this measure for the present. nothing remarkable happened during the day.
we have yet several days provision on hand, which we hope will be sufficient to
subsist us during the time we are compelled by the weather to remain at this place.
Atho' we have not fared sumptuously this winter and spring at Fort Clatsop, we have
lived quite as comfortably as we had any reason to expect we should; and have
accomplished every object which induced our remaining at this place except that of
meeting with the traders who visit the entrance of this river. our salt will be very
sufficient to last us to the Missouri where we have a stock in store. it would have
been very fortunate for us had some of those traders arrived previous to our
departure from hence, as we should then have had it in our power to obtain an
addition to our stock of merchandize which would have made our homeward bound
journey much more comfortable. many of our men are still complaining of being
unwell; Willard and Bratton remain weak, principally I believe for the want of proper
food. I expect when we get under way we shall be much more healthy. it has always
had that effect on us heretofore. The guns of Drewyer and Sergt. Pryor were both
out of order. the first was repared with a new lock, the old one having become unfit
for uce; the second had the cock screw broken which was replaced by a duplicate
which had been prepared for the lock at Harpers ferry where she was manufactured.
but for the precaution taken in bringing on those extra locks, and parts of locks, in
addition to the ingenuity of John Shields, most of our guns would at this moment
[have] been untirely unfit for use; but fortunately for us I have it in my power here
to record that they are all in good order.
FRIDAY MARCH 21ST 1806.
our sick men Willard and bratton do not seem to recover: the former was taken with
a violent pain in his leg and thye last night.

Page 336
Bratton is now so much reduced that I am somewhat uneasy with rispect to his
recovery; the pain of which he complains most seems to be seated in the small of his
back and remains obstinate. I beleive that it is the rheumatism with which they are
both afflicted.
[Clark] SUNDAY 23RD MARCH 1806
This morning proved so raney and uncertain that we were undetermined for some
time whether we had best set out & risque the [tide] which appeared to be riseing or
not. the rained seased and it became fair about Meridian, at which time we loaded
our canoes & at 1 P. M. left Fort Clatsop on our homeward bound journey. at this
place we had wintered and remained from the 7th of Decr. 1805 to this day and have
lived as well as we had any right to expect, and we can say that we were never one
day without 3 meals of some kind a day either pore Elk meat or roots,
notwithstanding the repeated fall of rain which has fallen almost constantly since we
passed the long narrows Soon after we had set out from Fort Clatsop we were met
by Delashelwilt & 8 men of the Chinnook and Delashelwilts wife the old boud and his
six Girls, they had, a canoe, a sea otter skin, dried fish and hats for sale, we
purchased a sea otter skin, and proceeded on, thro' Meriwethers Bay, there was a
stiff breese from the S.W. which raised considerable swells around Meriwethers point
which was as much as our canoes could ride. above point William we came too at
the camp of Drewyer & the 2 Field's. here we encamped for the night having made
16 miles.
The daily rain continued. The winds that accompanied it raised great waves on the
Columbia, which added to the difficulty of rowing the dugouts against the current.
They hugged the Oregon shore, having usually held to the other one on the descent.
Shore parties explored it and hunters ranged ahead, bringing in the interminable elk
and an occasional deer.
Indians swarmed about them, some of them acquaintances of the winter or last fall.
Mostly they were a wretched lot. The village of one band was "the dirtiest and
stinkingest place I ever saw in any shape whatever. and the inhabitants partake of
the carrestick [char-

Page 337
acteristic] of the village." They had food to sell roots, dogs, sturgeon, dried salmon,
seal meat but they charged prices so high that frequently the captains could not, or
would not, buy. The refusal of one group to sell food for anything but tobacco
reveals that "we are now obliged to deny the uce of this article" to the party and that
they "suffer much for the want of it. they substitute the bark of the wild crab [apple]
which they chew; it is very bitter, and they assure me they find it a good substitute
for tobacco. the smokers substitute the inner bark of the red willow and the
sacacommis.'' All of the bands they met were expert thieves but most of them were
friendly; the hostile tribes were farther up the river. The captains continued to
record ethnological observations and worked out the complex intertribal trading
system of the Columbia. In this trade their late neighbors the Clatsops were carriers
and middlemen.
They also continued to inquire about the geography. As they neared Sauvie Island,
they decided that "there must be some other considerable river which flowed into
the columbia on it's south side below us which we have not yet seen, as the
extensive valley on that side of the river lying between the mountainous country of
the Coast [Range] and the Western [Cascade] mountains must be watered by some
stream." It is indeed: by the Willamette.
Now they got important information bearing on their plans.
[Lewis] TUESDAY APRIL 1ST 1806.
We were visited by several canoes of natives in the course of the day; most of whom
were decending the river with their women and children. they informed us that they
resided at the great rapids [The Dalles] and that their relations at that place were
much streightened at that place for want of food; that they had consumed their
winter store of dryed fish and that those of the present season had not yet arrived. I
could not learn wheather they took the sturgeon but presume if they do it is in but
small quantities as they complained much of the scarcity of food among them. they
informed us that the nations above them were in the same situation & that they did
not expect the Salmon to arrive untill the full of the next moon which happens on the
2d of May. we did not doubt the varacity of these people who seemed to be on their
way with their families and effects in surch of subsistence which they find it easy to
procure in this fertile valley.

Page 338
This information gave us much uneasiness with rispect to our future means of
susbsistence. above [the] falls or through the plains from thence to the Chopunnish
[Nez Percés] there are no deer Antelope nor Elk on which we can depend for
subsistence; their horses are very poor most probably at this season, and if they
have no fish their dogs must be in the same situation. under these circumstances
there seems to be but a gloomy prospect for subsistence on any terms; we therefore
took it into serious consideration what measures we were to pursue on this
occasion; it was at once deemed inexpedient to wait the arrival of the salmon as that
would detain us so large a portion of the season that it is probable we should not
reach the United States before the ice would close the Missouri; or at all events
would hazard our horses which we left in charge of the Chopunnish who informed us
they intended passing the rocky mountains to the Missouri as early as the season
would permit them w[h]ich is as we believe about the begining of May.1 should
these people leave their situation near kooskooske before our arrival we may
probably find much difficulty in recovering our horses; without which there will be
little possibility of repassing the mountains; we are therefore determined to loose as
little time as possible in geting to the Chopunnish Village.
I purchased a canoe from an Indian to day for which I gave him six fathoms of
wampum beads; he seemed satisfyed with his bargain and departed in another
canoe but shortly after returned and canceled the bargain, took his canoe and
returned the beads. this is frequently the case in their method of traiding and is
deemed fair by them.
WENDESDAY APRIL 2ED 1806.
This morning we came to a resolution to remain at our present encampment or some
where in this neighbourhood untill we had obtained as much dryed meat as would be
necessary for our voyage as far as the Chopunnish. to exchange our perogues for
canoes with the natives on our way to the great falls of the columbia or purchase
such canoes from them for Elk-skins and Merchandize as would answer our
purposes. these canoes we intend exchanging with the natives of the plains for
horses as we proceed untill we
1 This, as will appear, was an error.

Page 339
obtain as many as will enable us to travel altogether by land. at some convenient
point, perhaps at the entrence of the S.E. branch of the Columbia, we purpose
sending a party of four or five men a head to collect our horses that they may be in
readiness for us by our arrival at the Chopunnish; calculating by thus acquiring a
large stock of horses we shall not only secure the means of transporting our
baggage over the mountains but that we will also have provided the means of
subsisting; for we now view the horses as our only certain resource for food, nor do
we look forward to it with any detestation or horrow [horror], so soon is the mind
which is occupyed with any interesting object, reconciled to it's situation. we now
enformed the party of our intention of laying in a store of meat at this place, and
immediately dispatched two parteis consisting of nine men to the opposite side of the
river. we also sent out three others on this side, and those who remained in camp
were employed in collecting wood making a scaffoald and cutting up the meant in
order to dry it.
about this time several canoes of the natives arrived at our camp and among others
one from below which had on board eight men of the Shah-ha-la nation these men
informed us that 2 young men whom they pointed out were Cash-hooks and resided
at the falls of a large river which discharges itself into the Columbia on it's South side
some miles below us. we readily prevailed on them to give us a sketch of this river
which they drew on a mat with a coal. it appeared that this river which they called
Mult-no-mâh2 discharged itself behind the Island which we called the image canoe
Island and as we had left this island to the S. both in ascending and decending the
river we had never seen it. they informed us that it was a large river and run a
considerable distance to the South between the mountains. Capt. Clark determined
to return and examine this river accordingly he took a party of seven men and one of
the perogues and set out 1\2 after 11 A.M., he hired one of the Cashhooks, for a
birning glass, to pilot him to the entrance of the Multnomah river and took him on
board with him.
[Clark] WEDNESDAY APRIL 2ND 1806
I had not proceeded far eer I saw 4 large canoes at some distance above decending
and bending their course towards our Camp
2 The Willamette.

Page 340
which at this time is very weak Capt. Lewis haveing only 10 men with him. I
hesitated for a moment whether it would not be advisable for me to return and delay
until a part of our hunters should return to add more strength to our Camp. but on a
second reflection and reverting to the precautions always taken by my friend Capt
Lewis on those occasions banished all apprehensions and I proceeded on down. at 8
miles passed a village on the South side at this place my Pilot informed me he
resided and that the name of the tribe is Ne-cha-co-lee, I proceeded on without
landing. at 3 P. M. I landed at a large double house of the Ne-er-che-ki-oo tribe of
the Shah-ha-la Nation. on the bank at different places I observed small canoes which
the women make use of to gather wappato & roots in the Slashes. those canoes are
from 10 to 14 feet long and from 18 to 23 inches wide in the widest part tapering
from the center to both ends and about 9 inches deep and so light that a woman
may with one hand haul them with ease, and they are sufficient to carry a woman
an[d] some loading. I think 100 of these canoes were piled up and scattered in
different directions about in the woods, in the vicinity of this house, the pilot
informed me that those canoes were the property of the inhabitents of the Grand
rapids who used them ocasionally to gather roots.
I entered one of the rooms of this house and offered several articles to the nativs in
exchange for wappato. they were sulkey and they positively refused to sell any. I
had a small pece of port fire match [fuse] in my pocket, off of which I cut a pece one
inch in length & put it into the fire and took out my pocket compas and set myself
down on a mat on one side of the fire, and [also showed] a magnet which was in the
top of my ink stand the port fire cought and burned vehemently, which changed the
colour of the fire; with the magnit I turned the needle of the compas about very
briskly; which astonished and alarmed these nativs and they laid several parsles of
wappato at my feet, & begged of me to take out the bad fire; to this I consented; at
this moment the match being exhausted was of course extinguished and I put up the
magnet &c. this measure alarmed them so much that the womin and children took
shelter in their beads and behind the men, all this time a very old blind man was
speaking with great vehemunce, appearently imploring his god. I lit my pipe and
gave them smoke, & gave the womin the full amount [value] of the roots which they

Page 341
had put at my feet. they appeared somewhat passified and I left them and proceeded
on. on the south side of Image Canoe Island which I found to be two Islands, hid
from the opposit side by one near the center of the river. the lower point of the
upper and the upper point of the lower cannot be seen from the North Side of the
Columbia on which we had passed both decending and ascending and had not
observed the apperture between those islands.
at the distance of 13 miles below the last village and at the place I had supposed was
the lower point of the image canoe island, I entered this river which the nativs had
informed us of, called Multnomah River so called by the nativs from a nation who
reside on Wappato Island a little below the enterance of this river. Multnomah
discharges itself in the Columbia on the S.E. and may be justly said to be 1\4 the
size of that noble river. Multnomah had fallen 18 inches from its greatest annual
height. three small Islands are situated in it's mouth which hides the river from view
from the Columbia. from the enterance of this river, I can plainly see Mt. Jefferson
which is high and covered with snow S.E. Mt. Hood East, Mt. St. Helians [and] a high
humped mountain [Mount Adams] to the East of Mt. St. Helians.
THURSDAY APRIL 3RD 1806
The water had fallen in the course of last night five inches. I set out and proceeded
up a short distance and attempted a second time to fathom the river with my crod of
5 fathom but could find no bottom. the mist was so thick that I could see but a short
distance up this river. When I left it, it was bending to the East of S.E. being perfectly
satisfyed of the size and magnitude of this great river which must water that vast
tract of Country between the western range of mountains and those on the sea coast
and as far S. as the Waters of Callifornia about Latd. 37. North. I deturmined to
return. at 7 oClock A. M. set out on my return. the men exirted themselves and we
arived at the Neerchokioo house in which the nativs were so illy disposed yesterday
at 11 A. M.
I observe the wreck of 5 house remaining of a very large village, the houses of which
had been built in the form of those we first saw at the long narrows of the E-lute
Nation with whome those people are connected. I indeavored to obtain from those
people of

Page 342
the situation of their nation, if scattered or what had become of the nativs who must
have peopled this great town. an old man who appeared of some note among them
and father to my guide brought foward a woman who was badly marked with the
Small Pox and made signs that they all died with the disorder which marked her face,
and which she was verry near dieing with when a girl. from the age of this woman
this Distructive disorder I judge must have been about 28 or 30 years past, and
about the time the Clatsops inform us that this disorder raged in their towns and
distroyed their nation. Those people speak a different language from those below
tho' in their dress habits and manners &c. they differ but little from the
Quathlahpohtles. their women ware the truss as those do of all the nations residing
from the Quathlahpohtle to the enterance of Lewis's river and on the Columbia above
for some distance. those people have some words the same with those below but
the air of their language is entirely different, their men are stouter and much better
made, and their womin ware larger & longer robes than those do below; those are
most commonly made of Deer skins dressed with the hair on them. they pay great
attention to their aged severall men and women whom I observed in this village had
arived at a great age, and appeared to be helthy tho' blind. I provailed on an old man
to draw me a sketch of the Multnomar River and give me the names of the nations
resideing on it which he readily done, and gave me the names of 4 nations who
reside on this river two of them very noumerous.
The enterance of Multnomah river is 142 miles up the Columbia river from its
enterance into the Pacific Ocean.

Page 343

Chapter XXV
From Sandy River to the Dalles of the Columbia
The party remained in camp on Sauvie Island, hunting and drying meat. They hoped
to amass a sufficient quantity to last them till they reached the Nez Percés. Since the
rain was almost continuous, they had to dry it over fires. Overcast skies prevented
them from making celestial observations and gales lashed the river to turbulence. In
the wide river below the mouth of the Willamette, they had not realized how much
the spring flood was adding to the difficulty of their progress.
[Lewis] SUNDAY APRIL 6TH 1806.
This morning we had the dryed meat secured in skins and the canoes loaded; we
took breakfast and departed at 9 A.M. we continued up the N. side of the river nearly
to the place at which we had encamped on the 3rd of Nov. when we passed the river
to the south side in quest of the hunters we had sent up yesterday and the day
before. from the appearance of a rock near which we were encamped on the 3rd of
November last I could judge better of the rise of the water than I could at any point
below. I think the flood of this spring has been about 12 feet higher than it was at
that time; the river is here about 1 1\2 miles wide; it's general width from the
beacon rock which may be esteemed the head of tide water, to the marshey islands
is from one to 2 miles tho' in many places it is still wider. it is only in the fall of the
year when the river is low that the tides are persceptable as high as the beacon rock.
This remarkable rock which stands on the North shore of the river is unconnected
with the hills and rises to the hight of seven hundred

Page 344
feet; it has some pine or reather fir timber on it's no[r]thern side, the southern is a
precipice of it's whole hight. it rises to a very sharp point and is visible for 20 miles
below on the river.
[Clark] TUESDAY APRIL 8TH 1806
This morning about day light I heard a considerable roreing like wind at a distance
and in the course of a short time wavs rose very high which appeared to come
across the river and in the course of an hour became so high that we were obliged to
unload the canoes, at 7 oClock A.M. the winds swelded and blew so hard and raised
the waves so emensely high from the N.E. and tossed our canoes against the shore
in such a manner as to render it necessary to haul them up on the bank. finding from
the appearance of the winds that it is probable that we may be detained all day, we
sent out Drewyer, Shannon, Colter & Collins to hunt with derections to return if the
wind should lul, if not to continue the hunt all day except they killed Elk or bear
sooner &c. John Shields cut out my small rifle & brought hir to shoot very well. the
party ows much to the injinuity of this man, by whome their guns are repared when
they get out of order which is very often.
I observed an Indian woman who visited us yesterday blind of an eye, and a man
who was nearly blind of both eyes. the loss of sight I have observed to be more
common among all the nations inhabiting this river than among any people I ever
observed. they have almost invariably sore eyes at all stages of life. the loss of an
eye is very common among them; blindness in persons of middle age is by no
means uncommon, and it is almost invariably a concammitant of old age. I know not
to what cause to attribute this prevalent dificientcy of the eye except it be their
exposure to the reflection of the sun on the water to which they are constantly
exposed in the occupation of fishing.
about 1 P M Collins Shannon and Colter returned. Collins saw 2 bear but could not
get a shot at them. neither Shannon nor Colter saw anything worth shooting. Soon
after Drewyer returned haveing only a Summer Duck. the Elk is gone to the
mountains as the hunters Suppose. in the evening late an old man his Son & Grand
Son and their wives &c. came down dureing the time the waves raged with great
fury. the wife of the grandson is a woman

Page 345
of difference appearance from any we have seen on this river, [s]he has a very
round head and pierceing black eyes. Soon after those people arived the old man
was detected in stealing a spoon and he was ordered away, at about 200 yards
below our camp they built themselves a fire and did not return to our fires after.
The wind continued violently hard all day, and threw our canoes with such force
against the shore that one of them split before we could get it out.
WEDNESDAY APRIL 9TH 1806
last night at a late hour the old amsiated [emaciated?] Indian who was detected in
stealing a Spoon yesterday, crept upon his belley with his hands and feet, with a
view as I suppose to take some of our baggage which was in several defferent
parcels on the bank. the Sentinal observed the motions of this old amcinated retch
untill he got with[in] a fiew feet of the baggage at [that] he hailed him and
approached with his gun in a possion [position] as if going to shoote which allarmed
the old retch in such a manner that he ran with all his powers tumbleing over brush
and every thing in his way.
at 7 A. M. we set out and proceeded on to the camp of Joseph & Reubin Fields. they
had killed nothing. here we did not delay but proceeded on to Wah-clel-lah Village on
the North side and brack-fast here one of the men Colter observed the Tomahawk
which was stolen from [me] on the 4th of Novr. last as we decended the Columbia,
he took the tomahawk the natives attempted to wrest it from him, he held fast the
Tomahawk. Those people attempted to excuse themselves from odium of stealing it,
by makeing signs that they had purchased the Tomahawk, but their n[e]ighbours
informed me otherwise and made signs that they had taken it. This village appears to
be the wintering station of two bands of the Shah-ha-la Nation. One band has
already moved [to] the Falls of the Multnomah which is the place they take their
Salmon. The other band is now moveing a few miles above to the foot of the first
rapid on this river, at which place they take their salmon. they take with them in their
canoes independent of all their household effects the bark of their houses, and
boards. those people were not hospita[b]l[e] and with some dificuelty we precured 5
dogs and a fiew Wappato of them.

Page 346
at 2 oClock P. M. we set out and passed under the Beacon rock on the North Side of
two small Islds. situated nearest the N. side. at 4 P. M. we arived at the first rapid at
the head of Strawberry island at which place on the N W. Side of the Columbia1 here
we found the nativs from the last village rebuilding their habitations of the bark of
their old village 16 Huts are already compleated and appear only temporrary it is
most probable that they only reside here dureing the season of the Salmon. as we
could not pass with the large canoes up the N.W. Side for the rocks, the wind high
and a rainey disagreeable evining. our smallest canoe being too low to cross through
the high waves, we sent her up on the N W. Side with Drewyer and the two Fields
and after purchaseing 2 dogs crossed and into the sluce of a large high Island
seperated from the S.E. Side by a narrow chanel. in this chanel we found a good
harbor and encamped on the lower side. evening wet & disagreeable
THURSDAY APRIL 10TH 1806
at 6 A M we set out and proceeded to the lower point of the Island from whence we
were compelled to draw our canoes up a rapid for about 1\4 mile which we soon
performed. in crossing the river which at this place is not more than 400 yards wide
we fell down a great distance owing to the rapidity of the current. We continued up
on the N. Side of the river which [with] great dificuelty in consequence of the rapidity
of the current and the large rocks which forms this shore; the South Side of the river
is impassable. As we had but one sufficent toe roap and were obliged to employ the
cord in getting on our canoes the greater part of the way we could only take them
one at a time which retarded our progress very much. by evening we arived at the
portage on the N. Side where we landed and conveyed our baggage to the top of the
hill about 200 paces distant where we formed a camp. We had the canoes drawn on
shore and secured. the small canoe got loose from the hunters and went adrift with a
tin cup & a tomahawk in her; the Indians caught her at the last village and brought
her up this evening for which we gave them two knives; the canoe overset and lost
the articles which were in her.

the Columbia.

Page 347
[Lewis] FRIDAY APRIL 11TH 1806.
As the tents and skins which covered both our men and baggage were wet with the
rain which fell last evening, and as it continued still raining this morning we
concluded to take our canoes first to the head of the rapids, hoping that by evening
the rain would cease and afford us a fair afternoon to take our baggage over the
portage. this portage is two thousand eight hundred yards along a narrow rough and
slipery road. the duty of getting the canoes above the rapid was by mutual consent
confided to my friend Capt. C. who took with him for that purpose all the party
except Bratton who is yet so weak he is unable to work, three others who were
lamed by various accedents and one other to cook for the party. a few men were
absolutely necessary at any rate to guard our baggage from the War-clel-lars who
crouded about our camp in considerable numbers. these are the greates[t] thieves
and scoundrels we have met with. by the evening Capt. C. took 4 of our canoes
above the rapids tho' with much difficulty and labour. the canoes were much
damaged by being driven against the rocks in dispite of every precaution which could
be taken to prevent t. the men complained of being so much fatiegued in the evening
that we posponed taking up our 5th canoe untill tomorrow. these rapids are much
worse than they were [in the] fall when we passed them, at that time there were
only three difficult points within seven miles, at present the whole distance is
extreemly difficult of ascent, and it would be impracticable to decend except by leting
down the empty vessels by a cord and then even the wrisk would be greater than in
taking them up by the same means. the water appears to be (considerably) upwards
of 20 feet higher than when we decended the river.
many of the natives crouded about the bank of the river where the men were
engaged in taking up the canoes; one of them had the insolence to cast stones down
the bank at two of the men who happened to be a little detatched from the party at
the time. on the return of the party in the evening from the head of the rapids they
met with many of the natives on the road, who seemed but illy disposed; two of
these fellows met with John Sheilds who had delayed some time in purchasing a dog
and was a considerable distance behind the party on their return with Capt. C. they
at-

Page 348
tempted to take the dog from him and pushed him out of the road. he had nothing to
defend himself with except a large knife which he drew with an intention of puting
one or both of them to death before they could get themselves in readiness to use
their arrows, but discovering his design they declined the combat and instantly fled
through the woods. three of this same tribe of villains the Wah-clel-lars, stole my
dog this evening, and took him towards their village; I was shortly afterwards
informed of this transaction by an indian who spoke the Clatsop language, (some of
which we had learnt from them during the winter) and sent three men in pursuit of
the theives with orders if they made the least resistence or difficulty in surrendering
the dog to fire on them; they overtook these fellows or reather came within sight of
them at the distance of about 2 miles; the indians discovering the party in pursuit of
them left the dog and fled. they also stole an ax from us, but scarcely had it in their
possession before Thompson detected them and wrest[ed] it from them. we ordered
the centinel to keep them out of camp, and informed them by signs that if they made
any further attempts to steal our property or insulted our men we should put them to
instant death. a chief of the Clah-clel-lah tribe informed us that there were two very
bad men among the Wah-clel-lahs who had been the principal actors in these seenes
of outrage of which we complained, and that it was not the wish of the nation by any
means to displease us. we told him that we hoped it might be the case, but we
should certainly be as good as our words if they persisted in their insolence. I am
convinced that no other consideration but our number at this moment protects us.
The Chief had in his possession a very good pipe tomahawk which he informed us he
had received as a present from a trader who visited him last winter over land
pointing to the N.W., whome he called Swippeton; he was pleased with the
tommahawk of Capt. C. in consequence of it's having a brass bowl2 and Capt. C.
gratified him by an exchange. as a further proof of his being esteemed by this white
trader, he gave us a well baked Saylor's bisquit which he also informed us he had
received from Swippeton. from these evidences I have no doubt but the traders who
winter in some of the inlets to the N. of us visit this part of the Columbia by land at
certain seasons, most probably when they are confined to their
2 Clark's hatchet was a pipe-tomahawk.

Page 349
winter harbour. and if so some of those inlets are probably at no great distance from
this place, as there seems to be but little inducement to intice the trader hither from
any considerable distance particularly as the difficulty in traveling on the borders of
this mountainous country must be great at that season as the natives informed me
their snows were frequently breast deep. I observe snow-shoes in all the lodges of
the natives above the Columbean vally. I hope that the friendly interposition of this
chief may prevent our being compelled to use some violence with these people; our
men seem well disposed to kill a few of them. we keep ourselves perefectly on our
guard.
SATURDAY APRIL 12TH 1806.
It rained the greater part of last night and still continued to rain this morning. I
therefore determined to take up the remaining perogue this morning for which
purpose I took with me every man that could be of any service. a small distance
above our camp there is one of the most difficult parts of the rapid. at this place the
current sets with great violence against a projecting rock. in hawling the perogue
arround this point the bow unfortunately took the current at too great a distance
from the rock, she turned her side to the stream and the utmost exertions of all the
party were unable to resist the forse with which she was driven by the current, they
were compelled to let loose the cord and of course both perogue and cord went
adrift with the stream. the loss of this perogue will I fear compell us to purchase one
or more canoes of the indians at an extravegant price. after breakfast all hands were
employed in taking our baggage over the portage. we caused all the men who had
short rifles to carry them, in order to be prepared for the natives should they make
any attempts to rob or injure them. I went up to the head of the rapids and left Capt.
C. below. by 5 P.M. we had brought up all our baggage and Capt. C. joined me from
the lower camp with the Clahclellah chief. I employed Sergt. Pryor the greater part of
the day in reparing and corking the perogue and canoes. it continued to rain by
showers all day. as the evening was rainy cold and far advanced and ourselves wet
we determined to remain all night. the mountains are high steep and rocky. the rock
is principally black. they are covered with fir of several speceis and

Page 350
the white cedar. near the river we find the Cottonwood, sweet willow, broad leafed
ash, a species of maple, the purple haw, a small speceis of cherry; purple currant,
goosberry, red willow, vining and whiteburry honeysuckle, huckleburry,
sacacommis, two speceis of mountain holley, & common ash. for the three last days
this inclusive we have made only 7 miles
SUNDAY APRIL 13TH 1806.
The loss of one of our perogues rendered it necessary to distribute her crew and
cargo among the 2 remaining perogues and 2 canoes,3 which being done we loaded
and set out [at] 8 A.M. we passed the village immediately above the rapids where
only one house at present remains entire, the other 8 having been taken down and
removed to the oposite side of the river as before mentioned. we found the
additional laiding which we had been compelled to put on board rendered our vessels
extreemly inconvenient to mannage and in short reather unsafe in the event of high
winds; I therefore left Capt. C. with the two perogues to proceede up the river on
the N. side, and with the two canoes and some additional hands passed over the
river above the rapids to the Y-eh-huh village in order to purchase one or more
canoes. I found the village consisting of 11 houses crouded with inhabitants; it
appeared to me that they could have mustered about 60 fighting men then present.
they appeared very friendly disposed, and I soon obtained two small canoes from
them for which I gave two robes and four elkskins. I also purchased four paddles
and three dogs from them with deerskins. the dog now constitutes a considerable
part of our subsistence and with most of the party has become a favorite food;
certain I am that it is a healthy strong diet, and from habit it has become by no
means disagreeable to me, I prefer it to lean venison or Elk, and it is very far
superior to the horse in any state. after remaining about 2 hours at this Village I
departed and continued my rout with the four canoes along the S. side of the river
the wind being too high to pass over to the entrance of Cruzatts [Wind]
3 By ''perogues'' Lewis means the two large canoes they had bought from the
Indians, one on the downstream voyage, one during the winter. His "canoes"
are the remaining dugouts; they had been made at Canoe Camp in the Clearwater. Clark calls all four canoes.

Page 351
river where I expected to have overtaken Capt. C. not seing the perogues on the
opposite side I ascended the river untill one oclock or about 5 ms. above the
entrance of Cruzat's river. being convinced that the perogues were behind I halted
and directed the men to dress the dogs and cook one of them for dinner; a little
before we had completed our meal Capt. C. arrived with the perogues and landed
opposite to us. after dinner I passed the river to the perogues and found that Capt.
C. had halted for the evening and was himself hunting with three of the party.4
SONDAY APRIL 14TH 1806.
at 1 P.M. we arrived at a large village situated in a narrow bottom on the N. side.
their houses are reather detached and extent[d] for several miles. they are about 20
in number. These people differ but litt[l]e in appea[ra]nce dress &c. from those of
the rapids. they have some good horses of which we saw ten or a douzen. these are
the fi[r]st horses we have met with since we left this neighbourhood last fall, in short
the country below this place will not permit the uce of this valuable animal except in
the Columbian vally and there the present inhabitants have no uce for them as they
reside immediately on the river and the country is too thickly timbered to admit them
to run the game with horses if they had them. we halted at this village and dined.
purchased five dogs, some roots, shappalell, filberds and dryed burries of the
inhabitants. these people appeared very friendly. some of them informed us that
they had lately returned from a war excurtion against the snake indians who inhabit
the upper part of the Multnomah river to the S.E. of them. that they had been
fortunate in their expedition and had taken from their enimies most of the horses
which we saw in their possession. after dinner we pursued our voyage to the
entrance of a small run on N. side a little below a large village on the same side
opposite the sepulchre rock.
TUESDAY APRIL 15TH 1806.
We delayed this morning untill after breakfast in order to purchase some horses of
the Indians; accordingly we exposed some
4 Clark: "the wind rose and raised the wavs to such a hight that I could not
proceed any further."

Page 352
articles in exchange for horses the natives were unwilling to barter, we therefore put
up our merchandize and at 8 A.M. we set out. we halted a few minutes at the
sepulchre rock, and examined the deposits of the ded at that place. there were
thirteen sepulchres on this rock which stands near the center of the river and has a
surface of about 2 acres above high water mark. from hence we returned to the
no[r]thern shore and continued up it about four miles to another village of the same
nation with whom we remained last night. here we halted and informed the natives
of our wish to purchase horses; the[y] produced us several for sale but would not
take the articles which we had in exchange for them. they wanted an instrument
which the Northwest traders call an eye-dag (a sort of war hatchet) which we had
not. we procured two dogs of them and departed.
WEDNESDAY APRIL 16TH 1806
About 8 oClock this morning I passed the river with the two interpreters,5 and nine
men in order to trade with the nativs for their horses, for which purpose I took with
me a good part of our stock of merchindize. Capt L. sent out the hunters and set
several men at work makeing pack saddles. twelve horses will be sufficient to
transport our baggage and some pounded fish with our dried Elk, which we intend
takeing with us as a reserved store for the plains & rocky mountains. I formed a
Camp on the N. Side and sent Drewyer & Goodrich to the Skillute Village, and
Shabono & Frazer down to the Chilluckkitequaw Village with derections to inform the
nativs that I had crossed the river for the purpose of purchaseing horses, and if they
had horses to sell us to bring them to my camp. Great numbers of Indians came
from both villages and delayed the greater part of the day without tradeing a single
horse. Drewyer returned with the principal Chief of the Skillutes who was lame and
could not walk. after his arival some horses were offered for sale, but they asked
nearly half the merchandize I had with me for one horse. this price I could not think
of giveing.
the Chief informed me if I would go to his town with him, his people would sell me
horses. I therefore concluded to accompany him to his village 7 miles distant. we set
out and arrived at the
5 And Sacajawea, in the hope that this band might understand Shoshone.

Page 353
village at Sunset. after some serimony I entered the house of the Chief. I then
informed them that I would trade with them for their horses in the morning for which
I would give for each horse the articles which I had offered yesterd[ay]. The Chief
set before me a large platter of onions which had been sweeted [sweated]. I gave a
part of those onions to all my party and we all eate of them, in this state the root is
very sweet and the tops tender. the nativs requested the party to dance which they
very readily consented and Peter Cruzat played on the violin and the men danced
several dances & retired to rest in the houses of the 1st and second Chief. this village
is moved about 300 yards below the spot it stood last fall at the time we passed
down. We observed maney stacks of fish remaining untouched on either side of the
river. This is the great mart of all this country. ten different tribes visit those people
for the purpose of purchaseing their fish, and the Indians on the Columbia and
Lewis's river quite to the Chopunnish Nation visit them for the purpose of tradeing
horses buffalow robes for beeds, and such articles as they have not. The Skillutes
precure the most of their cloth knivs axes & beeds from the Indians from the North
of them who trade with white people who come into the inlets to the North at no
great distance from the Tapteet. their horses of which I saw great numbers, they
precure from the Indians who reside on the banks of the Columbia above, and what
fiew they take from the Towarnihiooks or Snake Indians. I smoked with all the
principal men of this nation in the house of their great Chief and lay my self down on
a mat to sleep but was prevented by the mice and vermin with which this house
abounded and which was very troublesom to me.
THURSDAY 17TH OF APRIL 1806
I rose early after [a] bad nights rest, and took my merchindize to a rock which
afforded an eligable situation for my purpose, and at a short distance from the
houses, and divided the articles of merchindize into parsels of such articles as I
thought best calculated to pleas the Indians. and in each parcel I put as many
articles as we could afford to give. and thus exposed them to view, informing the
Indians that each parcel was intended for a horse. they tanterlised me the greater
part of the day, saying that they had sent out

Page 354
for their horses and would trade as soon as they came. Several parcels of
merchindize was laid by for which they told me they would bring horses. I made a
bargin with the chief for 2 horses, about an hour after he canseled the bargin and we
again bargained for 3 horses which were brought forward, only one of the 3 could be
possibly used the other two had such intolerable backs as to render them entirely
unfit for service. I refused to take two of them which displeased him and he refused
to part with the 3rd.
I then packed up the articles and was about setting out for the village above when a
man came and sold me two horses, and another man sold me one horse, and
several others informed me that they would trade with me if I would continue untill
their horses could be drove up. this induced me to continue at this village another
day. Maney of the nativs from different villages on the Columbia above offered to
trade, but asked such things as we had not and double as much of the articles which
I had as we could afford to give. this was a very unfavourable circumstance as my
dependance for precureing a sufficiency of horses rested on the suckcess above
where I had reasons to believe there were a greater abundance of those animals,
and was in hopes of getting them on better terms. before precureing the 3 horses I
dispatched Crusat, Willard & McNeal and Peter Wiser to Capt Lewis at the Rock fort
Camp with a note informing him of my ill suckcess in precureing horses, and advised
him to proceed on to this place as soon as possible. that I would in the mean time
proceed on to the Enesher Nation above the Great [Celilo] falls and try to purchase
some horses of that people. Soon after I had dispatched this party the Chief of the
Enesher's and 15 or 20 of his people visited me and appeared to be anxious to see
the articles I offered for the horses. several of them agreed to let me have horses if I
would add sundery articles to those I offered which I agreed to do, and they lay'd
those bundles by and informed me they would deliver me the horses in the morning.
the chief informed me that their horses were all in the plains with their womin
gathering roots. they would Send out and bring the horses to this place tomorrow.
this intelligence was flattering, tho' I doubted the sincerity of those people who had
several times disapointed me in a similar way. however I deturmined to continue
untill tomorrow. Shabono pur-

Page 355
chased a verry fine mare for which he gave Hurmen [Ermine], Elks Teeth, a belt and
some other articles of no great value. no other purchase was made in the course of
this day. in the evening I rec[ei]ved a note from Capt L. by Shannon informing me
that he should set out early on tomorrow morning and should proceed up to the
bason 2 miles below the Skillute Village. and adviseing me to give double the prices
which we had first agreed on for each horse. I was envited into the house of the 2nd
Chief where concluded to sleep. this man was pore nothing to eat but dried fish, and
no wood to burn. altho' the night was cold they could not rase as much wood as
would make a fire.

Chapter XXVI
From the Dalles of the Columbia to Walla Walla River
[Clark] FRIDAY 18TH APRIL 1806
Early this morning I was awoke by an indian man of the Chopunnish Nation [the Nez
Percés] who informed me that he lived in the neighbourhood of our horses. this man
delivered me a bag of powder and ball which he had picked up this morning at the
place the goods were exposed yesterday. I had a fire made of some poles purchased
of the nativs a short distance from the houses and the articles exposed as yesterday.
Collected the 4 horses purchased yesterday and sent Frazier and Shabono with them
to the bason where I expected they would meet Cap Ls and commence the portage
of the baggage on those horses. about 10 A. M. the Indians came down from the
Eneesher Villages and I expected would take the articles which they had laid by
yesterday. but to my estonishment not one would make the exchange to day. two
other parcels of goods were laid by, and the horses promised at 2 P.M. I payed but
little attention to this bargain, however suffered the bundles to lye.
I dressed the sores of the principal Chief gave some small things to his children and
promised the chief some Medicine for to cure his sores. his wife who I found to be a
sulky Bitch and was somewhat efflicted with pains in her back. this I thought a good
oppertunity to get her on my side giveing her something for her back. I rubed a little
camphere on her temples and back, and applyed worm flannel to her back which she
thought had nearly restored her to her former feelings. this I thought a favourable
time to trade with the chief who had more horses than all the nation be-

Page 357
sides. I accordingly made him an offer which he excepted and sold me two horses.
Great numbers of Indians from defferent derections visited me at this place to day.
none of them appeared willing to part with their horses, but told me that several
were comeing from the plains this evening.
at 3 P.M. Sergt. Ordway & three men arived from Cap Lewis they brought with them
several Elk skins, two of my coats and 4 robes of the party to add to the stores I had
with me for the purchase of horses. Sgt. O. informed me that Cap L. had arived with
all the canoes into the bason 2 miles below and wished some dogs to eate. I had 3
dogs purchased and sent down. at 5 P. M. Capt. Lewis came up. he informed me
that he had [passed] the river to the bason1 with much dificuelty and danger,
haveing made one portage. as I had not slept but very little for the two nights past
on account of mice & Virmen with which those indian houses abounded, and haveing
no blanket with me, and the means of keeping a fire sufficent to keep me worm out
[of doors] was too expensive I deturmined to proceed with Capt. L. down to camp at
the bason. I left the articles of Merchendize &c. with Drewyer, Werner. Shannon &
Goodrich untill the morning. at the bason we cut up two of our Canoes for fire wood,
very much to the sagreen [chagrin] of the nativs notwithstanding they would give us
nothing for them. Capt. L. had 12 pack saddles completed and strings prepared of
the Elk skins for Lashing the loads.
SATURDAY 19TH APRIL 1806.
We deturmined to make the portage to the head of the long narrows, the 2 large
canoes we could take no further and therefore cut them up for fuel. we had our small
canoes drawn up very early and employed all hands in transporting our baggage on
their backs and by means of 4 pack horses, over the portage. This labour we had
accomplished by 3. P. M. and established our camp a little above the present Skillute
village. I left Capt L. at the bason and proceeded to the village early this morning
with a view to receive the horses which were promised to be brought this morning
for articles laid by last evining. in the course of this day I purchased four horses at
the Village, and Capt Lewis one at the bason before
1 Below the Long Narrows.

Page 358
he left it. after the baggage was all safely landed above the portage, all hands
brought over the canoes at 2 lodes which was accomplished by 5 P. M. as we had
not a sufficiency of horses to transport our baggage we agreed that I should proceed
on to the Enesher Villages at the great falls of the Columbia and if possible purchase
as maney horses as would transport the baggage from that place, and rid us of the
trouble and dificuelty of takeing our canoes further.2 I set out with Serjt Pryor, Geo.
Shannon Peter Crusat & Labiech at half past 5 P. M. for the Enesher village at which
place I arrived at 8 P.M. Several showers of rain in the after part of to day, and the S
W wind very high.
there was great joy with the nativs last night in consequence of the arrival of the
Salmon; one of those fish was cought, this was the harbenger of good news to
them. They informed us that those fish would arive in great quantities in the course
of about 5 days. this fish was dressed and being divided into small pieces was given
to each child in the village. this custom is founded on a supersticious opinion that it
will hasten the arrival of the Salmon. We were oblige[d] to dispence with two of our
kittles in order to acquire two of the horses purchased to day. we have now only one
small kittle to a mess of 8 men. These people are very fa[i]thless in contracts; they
frequently recive the merchindize in exchange for their horses and after some hours
insist on some additional article being given them or revoke the exchange.
The long narrows are much more formidable than they were when we decended
them last fall, there would be no possibility of passing either up or down them in any
vessle at this time.
[Lewis] SUNDAY APRIL 20TH 1806.
This morning I was informed that the natives had pilfered six tommahawks and a
knife from the party in the course of the last night. I spoke to the cheif on this
subject. he appeared angry with his people and addressed them but the property
was not restored. one horse which I had purchased and paid for yesterday and
which could not be found when I ordered the horses into close confinement
yesterday I was now informed had been gambled away by the rascal who had sold it
to me and had been taken away by a man

found impracticable.

of another nation. I therefore took the goods back from this fellow. I purchased a
gun from the cheif for which I gave him 2 Elkskins. in the course of the day I
obtained two other indifferent horses for which I gave an extravigant price. I found
that I should get no more horses and therefore resolved to proceed tomorrow
morning with those which I had and to convey the baggage in two small canoes that
the horses could not carry. for this purpose I had a load made up for seven horses,
the eighth Bratton was compelled to ride as he was yet unable to walk. I bart[er]ed
my Elkskins old irons and 2 canoes for beads. one of the canoes for which they
would give us but little I had cut up for fuel. I had the horses graized untill evening
and then picquited and hubbled within the limits of our camp. I ordered the indians
from our camp this evening and informed them that if I caught them attempting to
perloin any article from us I would beat them severely. they went off in reather a bad
humour and I directed the party to examine their arms and be on their guard. they
stole two spoons from us in the course of the day.
[Clark] SUNDAY 20TH APRIL 1806
I shewed the Eneshers the articles I had to give for their horses. they without
hezitation informed me that they would not sell me any for the articles I had, if I
would give them Kittles they would let me have horses, and not without that their
horses were at a long ways off in the planes and they would not send for them &c.
My offer was a blue robe, a calleco Shirt, a Silk handkerchief, 5 parcels of paint, a
knife, a Wampom moon, 8 yards of ribon, several pieces of Brass, a Mockerson awl
and 6 braces of yellow beeds; and to that amount for each horse which is more than
double what we gave either the Sohsohne or first flatheads we met with on Clarks
river I also offered my large blue blanket, my coat sword & plume none of which
seamed to entice those people to sell their horses. notwithstanding every exertion
not a single horse could be precured of those people in the course of the day.
[Lewis] MONDAY APRIL 21ST 1806.
Notwithstanding all the precautions I had taken with rispect to the horses one of
them had broken his cord of 5 strands of Elkskin

Page 360
and had gone off spanseled. I sent several men in surch of the horse with orders to
return at 10 A.M. with or without the horse being determined to remain no longer
with these villains. they stole another tomahawk from us this morning I surched
many of them but could not find it. I ordered all the spare poles, paddles and the
ballance of our canoe put on the fire as the morning was cold and also that not a
particle should be left for the benefit of the indians. I detected a fellow in stealing an
iron socket of a canoe pole and gave him several severe blows and mad[e] the men
kick him out of camp. I now informed the indians that I would shoot the first of them
that attempted to steal an article from us. that we were not affraid to fight them, that
I had it in my power at that moment to kill them all and set fire to their houses, but it
was not my wish to treat them with severity provided they would let my property
alone. that I would take their horses if I could find out the persons who had stolen
the tommahawks, but that I had reather loose the property altogether than take the
ho[r]se of an inosent person. the chiefs [who] were present hung their heads and
said nothing. at 9 A.M. Windsor returned with the lost horse, the others who were in
surch of the horse soon after returned also. the Indian who promised to accompany
me as far as the Chopunish country produced me two horses one of which he
politely gave me the liberty of packing.3 we took breakfast and departed a few
minutes after 10 OClock. having nine horses loaded and one which Bratton rode not
being able as yet to march; the two canoes I had dispatched early this morning. at 1
P.M. I arrived at the Enesher Village where I found Capt. Clark and party; he had not
purchased a single horse.
[Clark] MONDAY 21ST APRIL 1806
I found it useless to make any further attempts to trade horses with those unfriendly
people who only crowded about me to view and make their remarks and smoke, the
latter I did not indulge them with to day. at 12 oClock Capt Lewis and party came up
from the Skillutes Village with 9 horses packed and one which bratten who was yet
to weak to walk, rode, and soon after the two small canoes also loaded with the
residue of the baggage which
3 This ''guide'' is the Nez Percé who woke Clark on April 18.

Page 361
could not be taken on horses. we had every thing imediately taken above the falls. in
the mean time purchased 2 Dogs on which the party dined. whilst I remained at the
Enesher Village I subsisted on 2 platters of roots, some pounded fish and sun flower
seed pounded which an old man had the politeness to give me in return for which I
gave him several small articles.
The man who we had reason to believe had stolen the horse he had given for the
Kittle we thretened a little and he produced a very good horse in the place of that
one which we cheerfully receved. After dinner we proceeded on about 4 miles to a
village of 9 Mat Lodges of the Enesher: one of the canoes joined us, the other not
haveing observed us halt continued on. We obtained 2 Dogs and a small quantity of
fuel of those people for which we were obliged to give a higher price than usial, our
guide continued with us, he appears to be an honest fellow. he tels us that the
indians above will treat us with much more hospitallity than those we are now with.
we purchased another horse this evening but his back is in such a horrid state that
we can put but little on him; we obtained him for a triffle, at least for articles which
might be precured in the U. States for 10/ Virga. currency.
[Lewis] TUESDAY APRIL 22ED 1806.
we had not arrived at the top of a hill over which the road leads opposite the village
before Charbono's horse threw his load, and taking fright at the saddle and robe
which still adhered, ran at full speed down the hill, near the village he disengaged
himself from the saddle and robe, an indian hid the robe in his lodge. I sent our
guide and one man who was with me in the rear to assist Charbono in retaking his
horse which having done they returned to the village on the track of the horse in
surch of the lost articles they found the saddle but could see nothing of the robe the
indians denyed having seen it; they then continued on the track of the horse to the
place from whence he had set out with the same success. being now confident that
the indians had taken it I sent the Indian woman on to request Capt. C. to halt the
party and send back some of the men to my assistance being determined either to
make the indians deliver the robe or birn their houses. they have vexed me in such a
manner by such repeated acts of vil-

Page 362
lany that I am quite disposed to treat them with every severty, their defenseless
state pleads forgivness so far as rispects their lives. with this resolution I returned to
their village which I had just reached as Labuish met me with the robe which he
informed me he found in an Indian lodg hid behind their baggage. I now returned
and joined Capt. Clark who was waiting my arrival with the party.
we now made the following regulations as to our future order of march (viz) that
Capt. C. & myself should devide the men who were disencumbered by horses and
march alternately each day the one in front and the other in rear. haveing divided the
party agreeably to this arrangement, we proceeded on through an open plain
country about 8 miles to a village of 6 houses of the Eneshur nation, here we
observed our 2 canoes passing up on the opposite side; the wind being too high for
them to pass the river they continued on. we halted at a small run just above the
village where we dined on some dogs which we purchased of the inhabitants and
suffered our horses to graize about three hours. after dinner we proceeded on up the
river about 4 miles to a village of 7 mat lodges of the last mentioned nation. here our
Chopunnish guide informed us that the next village was at a considerable distance
and that we could not reach it tonight. a man b[e]longing to the next village above
proposed exchanging a horse for one of our canoes, just at this moment one of our
canoes was passing. we hailed them and ordered them to come over but the wind
continued so high that they could not join us untill after sunset and the Indian who
wished to exchange his horse for the canoe had gone on. we obtained 4 dogs and as
much wood as answered our purposes on moderate terms. we can only afford
ourselves one fire, and are obliged to lie without shelter, the nights are cold and days
warm.
WEDNESDAY APRIL 23RD 1806.
At day light this morning we were informed that the two horses of our Interpreter
Charbono were absent; on enquiry it appeared that he had neglected to confine them
to picqu[i]ts as had been directed last evening. we immediately dispatched Reubin
Feilds and Labuish to assist Charbono in recovering his horses. one of them was
found at no great distance and the other was given over as lost.

Page 363
we continued our march along a narrow rocky bottom on the N. side of the river
about 12 miles to the Wah-how-pum Village of 12 temperary mat lodges near the
Rock rapid. these people appeared much pleased to see us, sold us 4 dogs and
some wood for our small articles which we had previously prepared as our only
resource to obtain fuel and food through those plains. these articles con[s]isted of
pewter buttons, strips of tin iron and brass, twisted wire &c. here we met with a
Chopunnish [Nez Percé] man on his return up the river with his family and about 13
head of horses most of them young and unbroken. he offered to hire us some of
them to pack as far [as] his nation, but we prefer bying as by hireing his horses we
shal have the whole of his family most probably to mentain. at a little distance below
this village we passed five lodges of the same people who like those were waiting the
arrival of the salmon.
after we had arranged our camp we caused all the old and brave men to set arround
and smoke with us. we had the violin played and some of the men danced; after
which the natives entertained us with a dance after their method. this dance differed
from any I have yet seen. they formed a circle and all sung as well the spectators as
the dancers who performed within the circle. these placed their sholders together
with their robes tightly drawn about them and danced in a line from side to side,
several parties of from 4 to seven will be performing within the circle at the same
time. the whole concluded with a premiscuous dance in which most of them sung
and danced. these people speak a language very similar to the Chopunnish whome
they also resemble in their dress after the dance was ended the indians retired at our
request and we retired to rest. we had all our horses side hubbled and turned out to
graize; the river is by no means as rapid as when we decended of at least not
obstructed with those dangerous rapids the water at present covers most of the
rocks in the bed of the river. the natives promised to barter their horses with us in
the morning we therefore entertained a hope that we shall be enabled to proceede by
land from hence with the whole of our party and baggage.
[Clark] THURSDAY 24TH APRIL 1806
rose early this morning and sent out after the horses all of which were found except
McNeals which I hired an Indian to find and

Page 364
gave him a Tomahawk had 4 pack saddles made ready to pack the horses which we
may purchase. we purchased 3 horses, and hired 3 others of the Chopunnish man
who accompanies us with his family, and at 1 P.M. set out and proceeded on through
a open countrey rugid & sandy between some high lands and the river to a village of
5 Lodges of the Met-cow-we band haveing passed 4 Lodges at 4 miles and 2 Lodges
at 6 miles. Great numbers of the nativs pass us on hors back maney meet us and
continued with us to the Lodges. we purchased 3 dogs which were pore, but the
fattest we could precure, and cooked them with straw and dry willow. we sold our
canoes for a fiew strands of beeds.4 the nativs had tantelized us with an exchange of
horses for our canoes in the first instance, but when they found that we had made
our arrangements to travel by land they would give us nothing for them. we sent
Drewyer to cut them up, he struck one and split her they discovered that we were
deturmined to destroy the canoes and offered us several strans of beeds which were
accepted most of the party complain of their feet and legs this evening being very
sore. it is no doubt caused by walking over the rough stone and deep sand after
being accustomed to a soft soil. my legs and feet give me much pain. I bathed them
in cold water from which I experienced considerable relief. we directed that the 3
horses purchased yesterday should be hobbled and confined to pickquets and that
the others should be hobbled & spanceled, and strictly attended to by the guard
made 12 miles to day.
[Lewis] SUNDAY APRIL 27TH 1806.
This morning we were detained until 9 A.M. in consequence of the absence of one of
Charbono's horses. the horse at length being recovered we set out and at the
distance of fifteen miles passed through a country similar to that of yesterday; the
hills at the extremity of this distance again approach the river and are rocky abrupt
and 300 feet high. we ascended the hill and marched through a high plain 9 miles
when we again returned to the

River, beyond them to Traveller's Rest in the Bitterroot Valley and on to where
the dugouts are hidden at the forks of the Jefferson. They detour Celilo Falls,
traveling on the high land above the canvon.

Page 365
river, I now thought it best to halt as the horses and men were much fatiegued altho
we had not reached the Wallahwollah village as we had been led to beleive by our
guide who informed us that the village was at the place we should next return to the
river, and the consideration of our having but little provision had been our
inducement to make the march we had made this morning. we collected some of the
dry stalks of weeds and the stems of a shrub which resembles the southernwood;
made a small fire and boiled a small quantity of our jerked meat on which we dined;
while here the principal Cheif of the Wallahwallahs joined us with six men of his
nation. this Cheif by name Yel-lept! had visited us on the morning of the 19 October
at our encampment a little below this place; we gave him at that time a small medal,
and promised him a larger one on our return. he appeared much gratifyed at seeing
us return, invited us to remain at his village three or four days and assured us that
we should be furnished with a plenty of such food as they had themselves, and some
horses to assist us on our journey.
after our scanty repast we continued our march accompanyed by Yellept and his
party to the village which we found at the distance of six miles situated on the N.
side of the river at the lower side of the low country about 12 ms. below the
entrance of Lewis's river. This Cheif is a man of much influence not only in his own
nation but also among the neighbouring tribes and nations. This Village consists of
15 large mat lodges. at present they seem to subsist principally on a speceis of
mullet which weigh from one to three lbs. and roots of various discriptions which
these plains furnish them in great abundance. they also take a few salmon trout of
the white kind. Yellept haranged his village in our favour intreated them to furnish us
with fuel and provision and set the example himself by bringing us an armfull of
wood and a platter of 3 roasted mullets. the others soon followed his example with
rispect to fuel and we soon found ourselves in possession of an ample stock. they
birn the stems of the shrubs in the plains there being no timber in their
neighbourhood of any discription. we purchased four dogs of these people on which
the party suped heartily having been on short allowance for near two days. the
indians retired when we requested them this evening and behaved themselves in
every rispect extreemly well. the indians informed us that there was a good road
which passed from the columbia opposite to this

Page 366
village to the entrance of the Kooskooske on the S. side of Lewis's river; they also
informed us, that there were a plenty of deer and antelopes on the road, with good
water and grass. we knew that a road in that direction if the country would permit it
would shorten our rout at least 80 miles.
the indians also informed us that the country was level and the road good, under
these circumstances we did not hesitate in pursuing the rout recommended by our
guide whos information was corroberated by Yellept and others.
[Clark] MONDAY APRIL 28TH 1806
This morning early the Great Chief Yelleppet brought a very eligant white horse to
our camp and presented him to me, signifying his wish to get a kittle but being
informed that we had already disposed of every kittle we could possibly spare he
said he was content with whatever I thought proper to give him. I gave him my
Swoard, 100 balls & powder and some small articles of which he appeared perfectly
satisfied. it was necessary before we entered on our rout through the plains where
we were to meet with no lodges or resident Indians that we should lay in a stock of
provisions and not depend altogether on the gun. we derected R. Frazer to whome
we have intrusted the duty of makeing the purchases. to lay in as maney fat dogs as
he could procure; he soon obtained 10, being anxious to depart we requested the
Chief to furnish us with canoes to pass the river, but he insisted on our remaining
with him this day at least, that he would be much pleased if we would consent to
remain two or 3 days, but he would not let us have canoes to leave him this day.
that he had sent for the Chim-na-pums his neighbours to come down and join his
people this evening and dance for us. We urged the necessity of our proceeding on
imediately in order that we might the sooner return to them, with the articles which
they wished brought to them but this had no effect, he said that the time he asked
could not make any considerable difference. at length urged that there was no wind
blowing and that the river was consequently in good order to pass our horses and if
he would furnish us with canoes for that purpose we would remain all night at our
present encampment, to this proposition he assented and soon produced a canoe. I
saw a man

Page 367
who had his knee contracted who had previously applyed to me for some medisene,
that if he would fournish another canoe I would give him some medisene. he readily
consented and went himself with his canoe by means of which we passed our horses
over the river safely and hobbled them as usial.
We found a Sho-sho-ne woman, prisoner among those people by means of whome
and Sah-cah-gah-weah, Shabono's wife we found means of converceing with the
Wallahwallârs. we conversed with them for several hours and fully satisfy all their
enquiries with respect to our Selves and the Objects of our pursute. they were much
pleased. they brought several disordered persons to us for whome they requested
some medical aid. to all of whome we administered much to the gratification of those
pore wretches, we gave them some eye water which I believe will render them more
essential sirvice than any other article in the medical way which we had it in our
power to bestow on them sore eyes seam to be a universal complaint among those
people; I have no doubt but the fine sands of those plains and the river contribute
much to the disorder. [A] man who had his arm broken had it loosely bound in a
piece of leather without any thing to surport it. I dressed the arm which was broken
short above the wrist & supported it with broad sticks to keep it in place, put [it] in a
sling and furnished him with some lint bandages &c. to Dress it in future. a little
before sun set the Chimnahpoms arrived; they were about 100 men and a fiew
women; they joined the Wallahwallahs who were about 150 men and formed a half
circle arround our camp where they waited verry patiently to see our party dance.
the fiddle was played and the men amused themselves with danceing about an hour.
we then requested the Indians to dance which they very chearfully complyed with;
they continued their dance untill 10 at night. the whole assemblage of Indians about
350 men women and children sung and danced at the same time. Most of them
danced in the same place they stood and mearly jumped up to the time of their
musick. Some of the men who were esteemed most brave entered the space around
which the main body were formed in solid column and danced in a circular manner
side wise. at 10 P M. the dance ended and the nativs retired; they were much
gratified in seeing some of our party join them in their dance. one of their party who
made himself the most conspicious charecter in the dance and songs, we

Page 368
were told was a medesene man & could foretell things. that he had told of our
comeing into their country and was now about to consult his God the Moon if what
we said was the truth &c &c.
TUESDAY APRIL 29TH 1806
This morning Yelleppit furnished us with 2 canoes, and We began to transport our
baggage over the river; we also sent a party of the men over to collect our horses.
we purchased some deer [dogs] and chappellell this morning. we had now a store of
12 dogs for our voyage through the plains. by 11 A. M. we had passed the river with
our party and baggage but were detained several hours in consequence of not being
able to collect our horses. our guide now informed us that it was too late in the
evening to reach an eligible place to encamp; that we could not reach any water
before night. we therefore thought it best to remain on the Wallahwallah river about
a mile from the Columbia untill the morning. The Wallahwallah River discharges it's
self into the Columbia on it's South Side 15 miles below the enterance of Lewis's
River, or the S. E. branch. this is a handsom Stream about 4 1\2 feet deep and 50
yards wide. the Indians inform us that it has it's source in the range of Mountains in
view of us to the E. and S. E.5 The Snake indian prisoner informed us that at some
distance in the large plains to the South of those Mountains there was a large river
running to the N.W. which was as wide as the Columbia at this place,6 which is
nearly 1 mile. this account is no doubt somewhat exagurated but it serves to evince
the certainty of the Multnomah being a very large river and that it's waters are
seperated from the Columbia by those mountains, and that with the aid of a
Southwardly branch of Lewis's river which pass around the Eastern extremity of
those mountains, it must water that vast tract of country extending from those
mountains to the Waters of the Gulf of Callifornia and no doubt it heads with the
Rochejhone and Del Nord.
there are 12 other Lodges of the Wallahwallah Nation on this river a short distance
below our Camp. those people as well as the Chymnapoms are very well disposed,
much more so particular[ly]

misconception of the unexplored country to the southwest.

their women than they were when we decended the river last fall. Most of them have
long shirts and leggins, good robes and mockersons. their women were the truss
when they cannot precure the shirt, but very fiew are seen with the former at the
present. I prosume the suckcess of their winters hunt has produced this change in
their attire. they insisted on our danceing this evening, but it rained a little the wind
blew hard and the weather was cold, we therefore did not indulge them. Several
applyed to me to day for medical aide, one a broken arm another inward fevers and
several with pains across their loins, and sore eyes. I administered as well as I could
to all. in the evening a man brought his wife and a horse both up to me. the horse he
gave me as a present and his wife who was verry unwell the effects of violent coalds
was placed before me. I did not think her case a bad one and gave such medesene
as would keep her body open and raped her in flannel. left some simple medesin to
be taken. we also gave some Eye water.
WEDNESDAY APRIL. 30TH 1806
This morning we had some dificuelty in collecting our horses notwithstanding we had
hobbled & Picqueted those we obtained of those people. We purchased two other
horses this morning and 4 dogs. we exchanged one of our most indiferent horses for
a very good one with the Choponnish man who has his family with him. this man has
a doughter now arrived at the age of puberty who being a certain situation, is not
permited to acoiate with the family but sleeps at a distance from her father's camp,
and when traveling follows at some distance behind. in this state I am informed that
the female is not permited to eat, nor to touch any article of a culinary nature or
manly occupation. at 10 A.M. we had collected all our horses except the white horse
which Yelleppit the Great Chief had given me. the whole of the men haveing returned
without being able to find this hors, I informed the Chief and he mounted Capt
Lewis's horse and went in serch of the horse himself. about half an hour after the
Chopunnish man brought my horse. we deturmined to proceed on with the party
leaving one man to bring up Capt L.s horse when Yellepit should return. We took
leave of those honest friendly people the Wallahwallahs and departed at 11 A.M.
accompanied by our guide and the Chopunnish man and family.

Chapter XXVII
From Walla Walla River to Lawyer's Cañon Creek
The overland route which the expedition followed was a series of well-worn Indian
trails that paralleled the Columbia for a time, though on the highlands above the
canyons, then struck almost due east across the arid plains of southeastern
Washington. This leg of the journey was without incident.
[Clark] SATURDAY 3RD MAY 1806
This morning we set out at 7 A. M. we met with the We ark koomt whome we have
usially distinguished by the name of the big horn Chief from the circumstance of his
always wareing a horn of that animal suspended by a cord to his left arm. he is a 1st.
chief of a large band of the Chopunnish Nation. he had ten of his young men with
him. this man went down Lewis's river by Land as we decended it by water last fall
quite to the Columbia, and I believe was very instrumental in precureing us a
hospita[b]l[e] and friendly reception among the nativs. he had now come a
considerable distance to meet us. it rained, hailed, snowed & blowed with Great
Violence the greater portion of the day. it was fortunate for us that this storm was
from the S.W. and of course on our backs. the air was very cold. we devided the last
of our dried meat at dinner when it was consumed as well as the ballance of our
dogs nearly we made but a scant supper, and had not any thing for tomorrow;
however We-ark-koomt consoled us with the information that there was an Indian
Lodge on the river at no great distance where we might supply ourselves with
provisions tomorrow.

Page 371
[Lewis] SUNDAY MAY 4TH 1806.
Collected our horses and set out early; the morning was cold and disagreeable. we
ascended through a high level plain to a ravine which forms the source of a small
creek, thence down this creek to it's entrance into Lewis's river 7 1\2 ms. below the
entrance of the Kooskooske [Clearwater]. on the river a little above this creek we
arrived at a lodge of 6 families of which We-ark-koomt had spoken. we halted here
for breakfast and with much difficulty purchase[d] 2 lean dogs. the inhabitants were
miserably poor. we obtained a few large cakes of half cured bread made of a root
which resembles the sweet potatoe, with these we made some soope and took
breakfast. a great portion of the Chopunnish we are informed are now distributed in
small vilages through this plain collecting the quawmash and cows;1 the salmon not
yet having arrived to call them to the river.
the hills of the creek which we decended this morning are high and in most parts
rocky and abrupt. one of our packhorses sliped from one of those hights and fell into
the creek with it's load consisting principally of ammunition but fortunately neith[er]
the horse nor load suffered any material injury. the amounition being secured in
canisters the water did not effect it. after dinner we continued our rout up the West
side of the river 3 Ms. opposite to 2 lodges the one containing 3 and the other 2
families of the Chopunnish nation; here we met with Te-toh-ar-sky, the youngest of
the two cheifs who accompanied us last fall [to] the great falls of the Columbia we
also met with our pilot who decended the river with us as far as the Columbia. these
indians recommended our passing the river at this place and ascending the
Kooskooske on the N.E. side. they said it was nearer and a better rout to the forkes
of that river where the twisted hair resided in whose charge we had left our horses;
thither they promised to conduct us. we determined to take the advice of the indians
and immediately prepared to pass the river which with the assistance of three indian
canoes we effected in the course of the evening, purchased a little wood and some
bread of cows from the natives and encamped having traveled 15
1 The ''quawmash'' is, of course, the Western camass. The "cows" (usually
"couse" or "Kouse" in future literature) is the cowas or biscuitroot (Lomatium
geyeri). It was the commonest edible root in this locality and, unlike most,
could be eaten raw.

Page 372
Ms. only today. the evening was cold and disagreeable, and the natives crouded
about our fire in great numbers insomuch that we could scarcely cook or keep
ourselves warm. at all these lodges of the Chopunnish I observe an appendage of a
small lodge with one fire which seems to be the retreat of their women in a certain
situation the men are not permitted to approach this lodge within a certain distance
and if they have anything to convey to the occupants of this little hospital they stand
at the distance of 50 or 60 paces and throw it towards them as far as they can and
retire.

Collected our horses and set out at 7 A. M. at 41\2 ms. we arived at the enterance of
Kooskooske, up the N E Side of which we continued our march 12 miles to a large
lodge of 10 families haveing passed two other large Mat Lodges the one at 5 and the
other at 8 miles from the Mouth of the Kosskooske, but not being able to obtain
provisions at either of those Lodges continued our march to the 3rd where we arived
at 1 P. M. and with much dificuelty obtained 2 dogs and a small quantity of bread and
dryed roots. at the second Lodge of Eight families Capt L. & myself both entered
smoked with a man who appeared to be a principal man. as we were about to leave
his lodge and proceed on our journey, he brought forward a very eligant Gray mare
and gave her to me, requesting some eye water. I gave him a phial of Eye water a
handkerchief and some small articles of which he appeared much pleased. while we
were encamped last fall at the enterance of Chopunnish river, I gave an Indian man
some Volitile liniment to rub his knee and thye for a pain of which he complained, the
fellow soon after recovered and have never seased to extol the virtue of our
medicines. near the enterance of the Kooskooske, as we decended last fall I met
with a man, who could not walk with a tumure on his thye, this had been very bad
and recovering fast. I gave this man a jentle pirge cleaned & dressed his sore and
left him some casteel soap to wash the sore which soon got well. this man also
assigned the restoration of his leg to me. those two cures has raised my reputation
and given those nativs an exolted oppinion of my skill as a phi[si]cian.2 I have
already received maney applications. in our present situation I think it pardonable to
continue this deception for they will not give us any provisions without com2 Lewis: "my friend Capt. C. is their favorite phisician."

Page 373
pensation in merchendize, and our stock is now reduced to a mear handfull. We take
care to give them no article which can possibly injure them, and in maney cases can
administer & give such medicine & sirgical aid as will effectually restore in simple
cases &c. the Indians brought my horse which was left at the place we made canoes,
from the opposit side and delivered him to me while here. this horse had by some
accident seperated from our other horses above, and agreeably to indian information
had been in this neighbourhood some weeks.3
while at dinner an indian fellow very impertinently threw a half starved puppy nearly
into the plate of Capt. Lewis by way of derision for our eating dogs and laughed very
hartily at his own impertinence; Capt L. was so provoked at the insolence that he
cought the puppy and threw it with great violence at him and struck him in the
breast and face, seazed his tomahawk, and shewed him by sign that if he repeeted
his insolence that he would tomahawk him, the fellow withdrew apparently much
mortified and we continued our Dinner without further molestation.
after dinner we continued our rout 4 miles to the enterance of Colter's Creek about
1\2 a mile above the rapid where we sunk the 1st canoe as we decended the river
last fall. We encamped on the lower side of this creek a little distance from two
Lodges of the Chopunnish nation haveing traviled 20 1\2 miles to day one of those
Lodges contained 8 families, the other was much the largest we have yet seen. it is
156 feet long and about 15 feet wide built of Mats and straw, in the form of the roof
of a house haveing a number of small dores on each side, is closed at the ends and
without divisions in the intermediate space. this lodges at least 30 families. their fires
are kindled in a row in the center of the Lodge and about 10 feet assunder. we
arrived here extreemly hungary and much fatigued, but no articles of merchindize in
our possession would induce them to let us have any article of Provisions except a
small quantity of bread of Cows and some of those roots dryed. We had several
applications to assist their sick which we refused unless they would let us have some
dogs or horses to eat. a man whose wife had an abcess formed on the small of her
back promised a horse in the
3 Gass: "The old chief who is now with us says that the Snake Guide who
deserted us last fall stole and took two of our horses with him." So Toby, who
left without collecting his wages, received at least some compensation from
the United States.

Page 374
morning provided we would administer to her, I examined the abcess and found it
was too far advanced to be cured. I told them her case was desperate. agreeably to
their request I opened the abcess. I then introduced a tent and dressed it with
bisilican; and prepared some dozes of the flour of sulpher and creem of tarter which
were given with directions to be taken on each morning. a little girl and sundery
other patients were brought to me for cure but we posponed our opperations untill
the morning; they procured us several dogs but they were so pore that they were
unfit to eat.
TUESDAY MAY 6TH 1806
This morning the husband of the sick woman was as good as his word. he produced
us a young horse in tolerable order which we imediately had killed and butchered.
the inhabitents seemed more accommodating this morning, they sold us some
bread. we received a second horse for medecine & pro[s]cription to a little girl with
the rhumitism whome I had bathed in worm water, and anointed her a little with
balsom capivia. I dressed the woman again this morning who declared that she had
rested better last night than she had since she had been sick. I was busily imployed
for several hours this morning in administering eye water to a crowd of applicants.
we once more obtained a plentiful meal, much to the comfort of all the party. Capt
Lewis exchanged horses with We ark koomt and gave him a small flag with which he
was much pleased and gratifyed. the sorrel which Cap L. obtained is a strong active
well broke horse.
The Kooskooske river may be safely navigated at present all the rocks of the sholes
and rapids are perfectly covered; the current is strong, the water clear and cold. this
river is riseing fast. The timber of this river which consists principally of the long
leafed pine which commences about 2 miles below our present encampment on
Colters Creek.
it was 2 P M. this evening before we could collect our horses. at 3. P. M. we set out
accompanied by the brother of the twisted hair and We-ark-koomt. we derected the
horse which I had obtained for the purpose of eateing to be led as it was unbroke, in
performing this duty a quarrel ensued between Drewyer and Colter. We continued
our march along the river on its North Side 9. miles to a lodge of 6 families built of
sticks mats and dryed Hay, of the same

Page 375
form of those heretofore discribed. We passed a Lodge of 3 families at 4ms. on the
river, no provisions of any discription was to be obtained of these people. a little
after dark our young horse broke the rope by which he was confined and made his
escape much to the chagrin of all who recollected the keenness of their appetites last
evening. the brother of the twisted hair & Wearkkoomt with 10 others encamped
with us this evening. The nativs have a considerable Salmon fishery up Colters
Creek.
WEDNESDAY MAY 7TH 1806
This morning we collected our horses and set out early accompanied by the brother
of the twisted hair as a guide; Wearkkoomt and his party left us. we proceeded up
the river 4 miles to a lodge of 6 families just below the enterance of a small Creek,
here our guide recommended our passing the river, he informed us that the road
was better on the South Side, and that game was more abundant also on that side
near the enterance of Chopunnish river. we deturmined to pursue the rout
recommended by the guide, and accordingly unloaded our horses and prepared to
pass the river which we effected by means of one canoe in the course of 4 hours. a
man of this lodge produced us two canisters of Powder which he informed us he had
found by means of his dog where they had been berried in the bottom near the river
a fiew miles above. they were the same which we had berried as we deceded the
river last fall. as he had kept them safe and had honisty enough to return them to us,
we gave him a fire Steel by way of compensation.
The spurs of the rocky mountains which were in view from the high plain to day were
perfectly covered with snow. The Indians inform us that the snow is yet so deep on
the mountains that we shall not be able to pass them untill after the next full moon
or about the first of June. others set the time at a more distant period. this [is]
unwelcom intiligence to men confirmed to a diet of horse-beef and roots, and who
are as anxious as we are to return to the fat plains of the Missouri, and thence to our
native homes.
I observed in all the Lodges which we have passed since we crossed Lewis's river
decoys, or stocking [stalking] heads as they are sometimes called. these decoys are
for the deer and is formed of the skin of the head and upper portion of the neck of
that animale extended in the nateral shape by means of a fiew little sticks

Page 376
placed within. the hunter when he sees a deer conseals himself and with his hand
givs to the decoy the action of a deer at feed, and this induces the deer within
arrowshot; in this mode the Indians near the woody country hunt on foot in such
places where they cannot pursue the deer with horses which is their favourite
method when the grounds will permit.
The orniments worn by the Chopunnish are, in their nose a single shell of Wampom,
the pirl & beeds are suspended from the ears. beads are worn arround their wrists,
neck and over their sholders crosswise in the form of a double sash. the hair of the
men is cewed in two rolls which hang on each side in front of the body. Collars of
bears claws are also common; but the article of dress on which they appear to
bestow most pains and orniments is a kind of collar or brestplate; this is most
commonly a strip of otter skins of about six inches wide taken out of the center of
the skin it's whole length including the head. this is dressed with the hair on. this is
tied around the neck & hangs in front of the body the tail frequently reaching below
their knees; on this skin in front is attatched pieces of pirl, beeds, wampom, pices of
red cloth and in short whatever they conceive most valuable or ornamental.
THURSDAY 8TH OF MAY 1806.
Drewyer & P. Crusat brought in a Deer each & Collins wounded one which our Dog
caught near our camp. Total of our stock of provisions 4 deer & some horse flesh. on
the small creek which passes our Camp, the nativs have laterly encamped and as we
are informed have been much distressed for provisions, they have fallen a number of
small pine in the vicinity of this Encampment for the Seed which is in the bur of
which they eate. we are informed that they were compelled to collect the moss of the
pine boil & eate it in the latter part of the last winter. on the creek near our camp I
observed a kind of trap which was made with great panes to catch the small fish
which pass down with the stream. This was a dam formed of stone so as to collect
the water in a narrow part not exceeding 3 feet wide from which place the water shot
with great force and scattered through some small willows closely connected and
fastened with bark, this mat of willow switches was about 4 feet wide and 6 long
lying in a horozontal position, fastened at the extremety. the small fish which fell on
those wil-

Page 377
lows was washed on the Willows where they [lie] untill taken off &c. I cought or took
off those willows 9 small trout from 3 to 7 Inches in length. Soon after I returned
from the fishery an Indian came from a fishery of a similar kind a little above with 12
small fish which he offered me which I declined axcepting as I found from his signs
that his house was a short distance above, and that those fisheries afforded the
principal part of the food for his children.
The great Chief of the Bands below who has a cut nose joined us this morning. we
gave the interals with 4 young fauns which was in two of the deer killed to day to the
Indians also some of our deer & horse flesh. the paunch of the deer they eate
without any preperation further than washing them a little. the fauns they boiled and
eate every part of them even the Skins with the hair. The Snake Indian was much
displeased that he was not furnished with as much Deer as he could eate. he refused
to speake to the wife of Shabono, through whome we could understand the nativs.
we did not indulge him and in the after part of the day he came too and spoke very
well. we loaded up and set on on the roade leading as we were informed to the lodge
of the twisted hair, the Chief in whoes care we had left our horses. we were
accompanied by the Cut nose Chief our old Chief who had accompanied us down the
river and several men. we assended the hills which was steep and emencely high to
a leavel rich country thinly timbered with pine. we had not proceeded more than 4
miles before we met the twisted hair and several men meeting of us. we were verry
coolly receved by the twisted hair. he spoke aloud and was answered by the Cut
nose. we could not learn what they said, but plainly discovered that a
missunderstanding had taken place between them. we made signs to them that we
should proceed on to the next water and encamp. accordingly I set out and they all
followed. we had not proceeded far before the road crossed a small handsom stream
on which we encamped. The parties of those two Chiefs took different positions at
some distance from each other and all appeared sulkey.
after we had formed our camp we sent Drewyer with a pipe to smoke with the
twisted hair and lern the cause of the dispute between him and the Cut nose, and
also to invite him to our fire to smoke with us. The twisted hair came to our fire to
smoke we then sent drewyer to the Cut Noses fire with the same directions.

Page 378
he returned and informed us that the Cut nose said he would join us in a fiew minits.
it appears that the cause of the quarrel between those two men is about our horses
and we cannot lern the particulars of this quarrel which probably originated through
jelousy on the part of the Cut nose who blames the twisted hair for suffer[ing] our
horses to be rode, and want water dureing the winter &c. twisted hair says the
horses were taken from him &c. The Cut nose joined us in a short time We smoked
with all the party of both Chiefs, and told them that we were sorry to find them at
varience with each other the cut nose said that the twisted hair was a bad man and
wore two faces, that he had not taken care of our horses as was expected, that
himself an the broken arm had caused our horses to be watered in the winter and
had them drove together, and that if we would proceed on to the village of the great
chief [for] whome we had left a flag last fall the broken arm he would send for our
horses, that he had himself three of them. he also informed us that the great Chief
hereing of our distressed situation had sent his son and 4 men to meet us and have
furnished on the way &c. that the young men had missed us and could never over
take us untill this time. that the great Chief had 2 bad horses for us and expected us
to go to his lodge which was near the river and about half a days march above &c.
The twisted hair told us that he wished to smoke with us at his lodge which was on
the road leading to the Great Chiefs lodge, and but a fiew miles ahead. if we would
delay at his lodge tomorrow he would go after our saddles and horses which was
near the place we made our canoes last fall. accordingly we informed the Indians of
our intentions. we all smoked and conversed until about 10 P M. the Indians retired
and we lay down. Derected 5 hunters to turn out early in the morning to hunt and
meet us at the twisted hair's lodge.
FRIDAY 9TH MAY 1806
We were detained untill 9 A.M. for our horses which were much scattered at which
time we collected our horses and set out and proceeded on through a butifull open
rich country for 6 miles to the camp of the twisted hair. this Campment is formed of
two Lodges built in the usial form of mats and straw. the largest and principal Lodge
is calculated for 2 fires only. the Second lodge is

Page 379
small & appears to be intended for the sick women who always retire to a seperate
lodge when they have the [blank space in MS.] before 2 P M all our hunters joined us
haveing killed only one deer which was lost in the river and a pheasent. Soon after
we halted at the lodge of the twisted hair he set out with two boys and Willard with a
pack horse down to the river near the place we made the canoes for our saddles and
a cannister of powder and some lead buried there, also a part of our horses which
resorted near that place. late in the evening they returned with 21 of our horse[s]
and about half of our saddles with the powder and ball. The greater part of the
horses were in fine order, tho' five of them had been rode & worsted in such a
manner last fall by the Inds. that they had not recovered and are in very low order,
and 3 with sore backs. we had all the recovered horses cought & hobbled. we
precured some pounded roots of which a supe was made thick on which we suped.
the wind blew hard from the S.W. accompanied with rain untill from 7 oClock untill 9
P.M. when it began to snow and continued all night.
SATURDAY 10TH OF MAY 1806
the air keen and cold the snow 8 inches deep on the plain. we collected our horses
and set out for the village of the Chief with a flag, and proceeded on through an open
plain. the road was slipry and the snow cloged and caused the horses to trip very
frequently. the mud at heads of the streams which we passed was deep and well
supplied with the Carmash [camass]. at 4 P M we arrived at the village of Tin nach e
moo toolt the Chief whome We had left a flag. this flag was hoisted on a pole
under[r] the flag the Chief met me and conducted me to a spot near a small run
about 80 paces from his Lodges where he requested me to halt which I did. Soon
after Cap Lewis who was in the rear came up and we smoked with and told this Chief
our situation in respect to provisions.
they brought forward about 2 bushels of quawmash 4 cakes of bread made of roots
and a dried fish. we informed the Chief that our party was not accustomed to eate
roots without flesh & proposed to exchange some of our oald horses for young ones
to eate. they said that they would not exchange horses, but would furnish us with
such as we wished, and produced 2 one of which we killed and informd. them that
we did not wish to kill the other at this time.

Page 380
We gave medals to the broken arm or Tin-nach-e-moo-tolt and Hoh-hâst-ill-pilp two
principal Chiefs of the Chopunnish Nation and was informed that there was one other
Great Chief (in all 4) who had but one eye. he would be here tomorrow. a large
Lodge of Leather was pitched and Capt. Lewis and my self was envited into it. we
entered and the Chief and principal men came into the lodge and formed a circle a
parcel of wood was collected and laid at the dore and a fire made in this conic lodge
before we entered it. the Chief requested that we might make the Lodge our homes
while we remained with him. here after we had taken a repast on roots & horse beef
we resumed our council with the indians which together with smokeing took up the
ballance of the evening. as those people had been liberal I directed the men not to
crowd their Lodges in serch of food the manner hunger has compelled them to do, at
most lodges we have passed, and which the Twisted Hair had informed us was
disagreeable to the nativs. but their previous want of hospitality had enduced us to
consult their enclinations but little and suffer our men to obtain provisions from them
on the best terms they could.
The Village of the broken Arm consists of one house or Lodge only which is 150 feet
in length built in the usial form of sticks, Mats and dry grass. it contains 24 fires and
about double that number of families. from appearance I prosume they could raise
100 fighting men. the noise of their women pounding the cows roots [biscuitroot]
remind me of a nail factory. The Indians appear well pleased, and I am confident that
they are not more so than our men who have their stomach once more well filled
with horse beef and the bread of cows. Those people has shewn much greater acts
of hospitallity than we have witnessed from any nation or tribe since we have passed
the rocky Mountains. in short be it spoken to their immortal honor it is the only act
which diserves the appelation of hospitallity which we have witnessed in this quarter.
SUNDAY 11TH MAY 1806
we were crouded in the Lodge with Indians who continued all night and this morning
Great numbers were around us. The One Eyed Chief arived and we gave him a medal
of the small size and spoke to the Indians through a Snake boy Shabono and his
wife. we informed them who we were, where we came from & our in-

Page 381
tentions towards them, which pleased them very much. a young man son to the
great Chief who was killed not long sence by the Indians from the N.E. brought an
elegant mare and coalt and Gave us, and said he had opened his ears to what we
had said and his heart was glad: and requested us to take this mare and coalt as a
token of his deturmination to pursue our Councels &c. The twisted hair brough[t] six
of our horses all in fine order. Great numbers of Indians apply to us for medical aid
which we gave them cherfully so far as our skill and store of Medicine would enable
us. schrofla, ulsers, rhumitism, sore eyes, and the loss of the use of their Limbs are
the most common cases among them. the latter case is not very common but We
have seen 3 instances of it among the Chopunnish. a very extroadinery compl[ai]nt.
about 3 P. M. Geo. drewyer arived with 2 deer which he had killed. he informed us
that the snow still continued to cover the plains.
We are now pretty well informed [about] the principal Chiefs of the Chopunnish
Nation; as all those chiefs were present in our lodge we thought it a favourable time
to repeet what had been said and to enter more minutely into the views of our
government with respect to the inhabitants of this Western part of the Continent,
their intentions of establishing tradeing houses for their relief, their wish to restore
peace and harmony among the nativs, the strength welth and powers of our nation
&c. to this end we drew a map of the country with a coal on a mat in their way, and
by the assistance of the Snake boy and our interpreters were enabled to make
ourselves understood by them altho' it had to pass through French, Minnetare,
Shoshone and Chopunnish languages. the interpretation being tegious it occupied
the greater part of the day, before we had communicated to them what we wished.
they appeared highly pleased. after this council was over we amused ourselves with
shewing them the power of magnetism, the spye glass, compass, watch, air gun and
sundery other articles equally novel and incomprehensible to them. they informed us
that after we left the Menetares last spring that 3 of their people had visited that
nation, and that they had informed them of us, and had told them that we had such
things in our possession but that they could not place confidence in the information
untill they had now witnessed it themselves.
In the evening a man was brought in a robe by four Indians and laid down near me.
they informed me that this man was a Chief of

Page 382
considerable note who has been in the situation I see him for 5 years. this man is
incapable of moveing a single limb but lies like a corps in whatever position he is
placed, yet he eats hartily, dejests his food perfectly, enjoys his understanding. his
pulse are good, and has retained his flesh almost perfectly; in short were it not that
he appears a little pale from having been so long in the shade, he might well be
taken for a man in good health. I suspect that their confinement to a diet of roots
may give rise to all the disorde[r]s of the nativs of this quarter except the Rhumitism
& Sore eyes, and to the latter of those, the state of debility incident to a vegitable
diet may measureably contribute. The Chopunnish not withstanding they live in the
crouded manner before mentioned are much more clenly in their persons and
habitations than any nation we have seen sence we left the Illinois.
MONDAY 12TH MAY 1806
after brackfast I began to administer eye water and in a fiew minits had near 40
applicants with sore eyes, and maney others with other complaints most common
Rhumatic disorders & weaknesses in the back and loins perticularly the womin. the
Indians had a grand Council this morning after which we were presented each with a
horse by two young men at the instance of the nation. we caused the chiefs to be
seated and gave them each a flag a pint of Powder and 50 balls to the two young
men who had presented the horses we also gave powder and ball. The broken arm
pulled off his leather shirt and gave me. In return gave him a shirt. We retired into
the Lodge and the natives spoke to the following purpote, i.e. they had listened to
our advice and that the whole nation were deturmined to follow it, that they had only
one heart and one tongue on this subject. they wished to be at peace with all nations
&c. Some of their men would accompany us to the Missouri &c. &c. as a great
number of men women & children were wateing and requesting medical assistance
maney of them with the most simple complaints which could be easily releived,
independent of maney with disorders intirely out of the power of Medison all
requesting something, we agreed that I should administer and Capt L to here and
answer the Indians. I was closely employed untill 2 P.M. administering eye water to
about 40 grown persons. some simple cooling medicenes to the disabled Chief, to
several women

Page 383
with rhumatic effections & a man who had a swelled hip. &c. &c.
in the evening three of our horses were brought all in fine order. we have now only
Six remaining out. Those people are much affraid of the blackfoot indians, and the
Big bellies of Fort de prarie establishment. those indians kill great numbers of this
nation whenever they pass over to hunt on the Missouri. one of our men bought a
horse for a fiew small articles of an Indian. The Indians brought up a fat horse and
requested us to kill and eate it as they had nothing else to offer us to eate. The Cut
Nose made a present of a horse to Drewyer at the same time the two horses were
offered to Capt. Lewis & my self. The horses of those people are large well formed
and active. Generally in fine order. sore backs caused by rideing them either with out
saddles, or with pads which does not prevent the wate of the rider pressing
imediately on the back bone, and weathers [withers] of the horse. the Indians
formed two parti[e]s and plaied for their beeds. we gave the twisted hair a gun,
powder & 100 ball in part for takeing care of our horses &c. and wish him to camp
near us untill we crossed the mountains which he agreed to do, and was much
pleased we have turned our attentions towards the twisted hair who has several
sons grown who are well acquainted as well as himself with the various roads
through the rocky Mountains and will answer very well as guides to us through those
mountains.
In the council to day the father of Hohâstillpilp said the Chopunnish were fully
convinced of the advantages of peace and ardently wished to cultivate peace with
their neighbors. early last Summer 3 of their brave men were sent with a pipe to the
Shoshones on the S E. fork of Lewis's river in the Plains of Columbia, their pipe was
disregarded and their 3 men murdered, which had given rise to the War expedition
against that nation last fall; that their warriers had fallen in with and killed 42 of the
Shoshones with the loss of 3 men only on their part; that this had satisfied the blood
of the deceased friends and they would never again make war against the
Shoshones, but were willing to receve them as friends. That as we had not seen the
Indians towards Fort de Prarie they did not think it safe to venture over to the Plains
of the Missouri, where they would fondly go provided those nations would not kill
them. I gave a vial of eye water to the Broken arm for to wash the eyes of all who
applied to him and told him when it was out we would replenish it again.

Chapter XXVIII
Encamped on the Upper Kooskooske
[Clark] TUESDAY 13TH OF MAY 1806.
A fine morning I administered to the sick and gave directions. we collected all our
horses and set out at 1 P.M. and proceeded down the Creek to the Flat head
[Clearwater] River a short distance below the enterance of the Creek. at this place
we expected to have met the Canoe which was promised to be furnished us, and for
which an indian set out very early this morning. we halted at the River unloaded our
horses and turned them out to feed. Several Indians accompanied us to the river and
continued untill evening. The man who set out early this morning to the forks of this
river for a canoe did not arive untill after sunset we remained all night; in the evening
we tried the speed of several of our horses. these horses are strong active and well
formed. Those people have emence numbers of them 50 or 60 or a Hundred head is
not unusial for an individual to possess.
The Chopunnish are in general stout well formed active men. they have high noses
and maney of them on the acqueline order with chearfull and agreeable
countinances; their complexious are not remarkable. in common with other Indian
Nations of America they extract their beard, but the men do not uniformly extract
their hair below, this is more particularly confined to the females. they appear to be
cheerfull but not gay, they are fond of gambling and of their amusements which
consists principally in shooting their arrows at a targit made of willow bark, and in
rideing and exersiseing themselves on horseback, raceing &c. they are expirt marks
men & good riders. they do not appear to be so much devoted to

Page 385
baubles as most of the nations we have met with, but seem anxious always to riceve
articles of utility, such as knives, axes, Kittles, blankets & mockerson awls. blue
beeds however may form an exception to this remark; This article among all the
nations of this country may be justly compared to gold and silver among civilized
nations. They are generally well clothed in their stile. their dress consists of a long
shirt which reaches to the middle of the leg, long legins which reach as high as the
waist, mockersons & robe. those are formed of various skins and are in all respects
like those of the Shoshone. Their orniments sonsists of beeds, shells and pieces of
brass variously attached to their dress, to their ears arround their necks wrists arms
&c. a band of some kind usially serounds the head, this is most frequently the skin of
some fir animal as the fox otter &c. I observed a tippet worn by Hohâstillpilp, which
was formed of Humane scalps and ornemented with the thumbs and fingers of
several men which he had slain in battle. they also were a coller or breastplate of
otter skin ornimented with shells beeds & quills. the women brade their hair in two
tresses which hang in the same position of those of the men, which ar[e] cewed and
hang over each sholder &c.
WEDNESDAY 14TH OF MAY 1806
we had all our horses collected by 10 a.m. dureing the time we had all our baggage
crossed over the River which is rapid and about 150 yards wide. after the baggage
was over to the North Side we crossed our hors[e]s without much trouble and
hobbled them in the bottom after which we moved a short distance below to a
convenient situation and formed a camp around a very conveniant spot for defence
this situation we concluded would be sufficently convenient to hunt the wood lands
for bear & Deer and for the salmon fish which we were told would be here in a fiew
days, and also a good situation for our horses. the hills to the E. & N. of us are high
broken & but partially timbered; the soil rich and affords fine grass. in short as we
are compelled to reside a while in this neighbourhood I feel perfectly satisfied with
our position.
imediately after we had crossed the river the Chief called the broken arm [and]
another principal Chief arived on the opposite side and began to sing. we sent the
canoe over and those chiefs, the son of the broken arm and the son of a Great Chief
who was killed last year by the Big bellies of Saskasshewin river. those two young

Page 386
men were the two whome gave Capt Lewis and myself each a horse with great
serimony in behalf of the nation a fiew days ago, and the latter a most elligant mare
& colt the morning after we arived at the village. Hohâstillpilp with much serimoney
presented Capt Lewis with an elegant Gray horse which he had brought for that
purpose. Capt Lewis gave him in return a Handkerchief two hundred balls and four
pounds of powder, with which he appeared perfectly satisfied, and appeared much
pleased. we made several attempts to exchange our Stalions for Geldin[g]s or
mar[e]s without success we even offered two for one. those horses are troublesom
and cut each other very much and as we can't exchange them we think it best to
castrate them and began the opperation this evening one of the indians present
offered his services on this occasion. he cut them without tying the string of the
stone as is usial. he [s]craped it very clean & seperate it before he cut it.
about Meridian Shannon came in with two Grows [grouse] & 2 Squireles common to
this country. his mockersons worn out obliged to come in early. Collins returned in
the evening with the two bears which he had killed in the morning one of them an old
hee was in fine order, the other a female with Cubs was meagure. we gave the
Indians about us 15 in number two sholders and a ham of the bear to eate which
they cooked in the following manner. towit on a brisk fire of dryed wood they threw a
parcel of small stones from the river, when the fire had burnt down and heated the
stone, they placed them level and laid on a parsel of pine boughs, on those they laid
the flesh of the bear in flitches, placeing boughs between each course of meat and
then coveing it thickly with pine boughs; after this they poared on a small quantity of
water, and covered the whole over with earth to the debth of 4 inches. in this
situation they suffered it to remain about 3 hours when they took it out fit for use.
This nation esteem the Killing of one of those tremendeous animals equally great
with that of an enemy in the field of action. we gave the claws of those bear which
Collins had killed to Hohâstillpilp.
THURSDAY 15TH OF MAY 1806
Reubin Fields went out to hunt his horse very early and saw a large bear and no
great distance from Camp. Several men went in pursute of the bear, and prosued his
trail some time without gitting sight of this monster. Shannon went out with Labeach
to

Page 387
hunt and continued out 3 days, Gibson and Hall accompanied them for the meat
Labeech killed yesterday which they brought in by 11 A M. this morning the female
[bear] was black with white hares intermixed and a white spot on the breast the
Cubs were about the size of a dog also pore. one of them very black and the other a
light redish brown or bey colour. These bear give me a stronger evidence of the
various coloured bear of this country being one specie only, than any I have
heretofore had. Several other colours have been seen.
Frazur Jo. Fields and Peter Wizer complain of a violent pain in their heads. Howard
and York with violent cholicks. the cause of those disorders we are unable to account
for. their diet and the sudin change of climate must contribute. The broken arm and
12 of the young men of his nation left us to day about 11 oClock and crossed the
river to his Village Hoh-hâst-ill-pilt and 3 old men continued with us untill about 5
P.M. when they left us and returned to their village. a party of 14 Indians passed our
camp about 1 P M on their way to the leavel uplands to run and kill the deer with
their horses and Bows and arrows. Some of them were also provided with deers
heads cased for the purpose of decoying the deer. those men continued with us but
a fiew minits and proceeded on. Those people hunt most commonly on horse back
seround the Deer or Goat which they find in the open plains & kill them with their
arrows, tho' they sometimes hunt the deer on foot & decoy them. we had all of our
horses drove together to day with a view to fermilurize them to each other. those
that were cut yesterday are stiff and several of them much swelled. we had all our
baggage secured and covered with a rouf of straw. our little fortification also
completely secured with brush around which our camp is formed. the Greater part of
our security from the rains &c. is the grass which is formed in a kind of ruff so as to
turn the rain completely and is much the best tents we have. as the days are worm
&c. we have a bowry made to write under which we find not only comfortable but
necessary, to keep off the intence heet of the sun which has great effect in this low
bottom. on the high plains off the river the climate is entirely different cool, some
snow on the north hill sides near the top and vegetation near 3 weeks later than in
the river bottoms, and the rocky Mountains imediately in view covered several say 4
& 5 feet deep with snow. here I behold three different climats within a fiew miles

Page 388
FRIDAY 16TH MAY 1806
The Indians of this country seldom kill the bear they are very much afraid of them
and the killing of a White or Grizly bear, is as great a feet as two of their enimey. the
fiew of those animals which they chance to kill is found in the leavel open lands and
pursued on horses & killed with their Arrows. they are fond of the flesh of this animal
and eate imoderately of it when they have a sufficiency to indulge themselves. The
men who were complaining of the head ake and cholick yesterday and last night are
much better to day. Shabonos Squar gathered a quantity of fenel roots which we find
very paliatiable and nurushing food. the onion we also find in abundance and boil it
with our meat.
SATURDAY 17TH MAY 1806
rained moderately all the last night and this morning untill, we are wet. the rains
unfortunately wet the Crenomuter in the fob of Capt. L. breaches, which has never
before been wet since we set out on this expedition. her works were cautiously
wiped and made dry by Capt. L. and I think she will receve no injury from this
misfortune &c. we arranged the hunters and horses to each hunter and directed
them to turn out in the morning early and continue out untill they killed something.
others arranged so as to take care of the hunters horses in their absence. rained
moderately all day. at the same time snowed on the mountains which is in to the S.
E. of us. no Indians visit us to day which is a singular circumstance as we have not
been one day without Indians since we left the long narrows of the Columbia.
the fiew worm days which we have had has melted the snows in the mountains and
the river has rose considerably. that icy barier which seperates me from my friends
and Country, from all which makes life estimable, is yet white with the snow which is
maney feet deep. I frequently consult the nativs on the subject of passing this
tremendious barier which now present themselves to our view for [a] great extent.
they all appear to agree as to the time those mountains may be passed which is
about the middle of June. Sergt. Pryor informs me that the snow on the high plains
from the river was shoe deep this morning when he came down. At the distance of
18 miles from the river and on the Eastern border of the

Page 389
high Plain the Rocky Mountain commences and presents us with Winter here we
have Summer, Spring and winter in the short space of twenty or thirty miles.
SUNDAY 18TH MAY 1806
The Squar wife to Shabono busied her self gathering the roots of the fenel called by
the Snake Indians Year-pah1 for the purpose of drying to eate on the Rocky
mountains. those roots are very paliatiable either fresh rosted boiled or dried and are
generally between the size of a quill and that of a mans fingar and about the length
of the latter. at 3 P M Jo. Field returned from the chase without killing any thing he
complains of being unwell. so[o]n after an old man and a woman arived the man
with sore eyes, and the woman with a gripeing and rhumatic effections. I gave the
woman a dose of creme of tarter and flour of Sulphur, and the man some eye water.
Lapage took a Salmon from an Eagle at a short distance below our camp. this is
induces us to believe that the Salmon is in this river and most probably will be here
in great numbers in the course of a fiew days.
MONDAY 19TH MAY 1806
We sent Shabono, Thomson, Potts, Hall & Wizer over to the Villages above to
purchase some roots to eate with our pore bear meat, for which purchase we gave
them a fiew awls, knitting pins, & arm ban[d]s and directed them to proceed up on
this side of the river opposit to the Village and cross in the cano[e] which we are
informed is at that place. about 11 oClock 4 men and 8 women came to our camp
with Thompson who went to the Village very early this morning. those men applyed
for Eye water and the Women had a variety of Complaints tho' the most general
complaint was the Rhumitism, pains in the back and the sore eyes, they also brought
fowd. a very young Child whome they said had been very sick. I administered eye
water to all, two of the women I gave a carthartic, one whose spirets were very low
and much hiped [depressed] I gave 30 drops of Lodomem, and to the others I had
their backs hips legs thighs & arms well rubed with Volitile leniment all of those pore
people thought themselves much benifited by what had been done for them, and at 3
P. M. they all returned to their Villages well satisfied. at 5 P. M. Potts,
1 The yampa or squawroot, Carum gairdneri.

Page 390
Shabono &c. returned from the Village with about 6 bushels of the root the nativs call
cowse and some bread of the same root. Rubin & Jos. Fields returned with the horse
Capt. Lewis rode across the rocky mountains we had this horse imediately cut with 2
others which we had not before thought proper to castrate. we amused ourselves
about an hour this after noon looking at the men run their horses, several of them
would be thought swift horses in the atlantic states.
WEDNESDAY 21ST MAY 1806.
as our tent is not sufficient to keep off the rain we are compelled to have some other
resort for a security from the repeeted showers which fall. we have a small half
circular place made and covered with grass which makes a very secure shelter for us
to sleep under. we divided our store of merchindize amongst our party for the
purpose of precureing some roots &c. of the nativs to each mans part amounted to
about an awl knitting pin a little paint and some thread & 2 Needles which is but a
scanty dependance for roots to take us over those Great snowey Barriers (rocky
mountains) which is and will be the cause of our Detention in this neighbourhood
probably until the 10 or 15 of June. they are at this time covered deep with snow.
the plains on the high country above us is also covered with snow. we eate the last
of our meat for Dinner to day, and our only certain dependance is the roots we can
precure from the nativs for the fiew articles we have left those roots with what game
we can precure from the wo[o]ds will probably last us untill the arival of the Salmon.
if they should not; we have a horse in store ready to be killed which the indians have
offered to us.
THURSDAY 22ND MAY 1806
a fine day we exposed all our baggage to the sun to air and dry, also our roots which
we have precured of the nativs. as the greater part of our men have not had any
meat to eate for 2 days, and the roots they complain of not being accustomed to live
on them altogether we directed a large coalt which was given to us by a young man
with an elegant mare [to be killed]. this coalt was fat and was handsom looking
meat. late in the evening we were informed that the horse which Capt L. rode over
the rocky mountains and which was cut day before yesterday had his hip out of place
since that time, and could not walk. Capt. Lewis examined

Page 391
him and thought he could not recover. at 5 p. m. two young men highly decurated in
their way came to our camp and informed us that the fat fish were in great numbers
in Lewis's river. Shabonos son a small child is dangerously ill. his jaw and throat is
much swelled. we apply a poltice of onions, after giveing him some creem of tarter
&c. this day proved to be fine and fair which afforded us an oppertunety of drying
our baggage which had got a little wet.
FRIDAY 23RD MAY 1806
The child is something better this morning than it was last night. we apply a fresh
poltice of the wild Onion which we repeeted twice in the course of the day. the
swelling does not appear to increas any since yesterday. The 4 Indians who visited
us to day informed us that they came from their village on Lewis's river two days ride
from this place for the purpose of seeing of us and getting a little eye water I washed
their eyes with some eye water and they all left us at 2 P. M. and returned to their
villages on the opposit side of this river.
the hunters informed us that they had hunted with great industry all the country
between the river and for some distance above and below without the smallest
chance of killing any game. they inform us that the high lands are very cold with
snow which has fallen for every day or night for several [days] past. our horses
which was cut is like to doe well.
[Lewis] SATURDAY MAY 24TH 1806.
The child was very wrestless last night; it's jaw and the back of it's neck are much
more swolen than they were yesterday tho' his fever has abated considerably. we
gave it a doze of creem of tartar and applyed a fresh poltice of onions. William
Bratton still continues very unwell; he eats heartly digests his food well, and has
recovered his flesh almost perfectly yet is so weak in the loins that he is scarcely
able to walk, nor can he set upwright but with the greatest pain. we have tried every
remidy which our engenuity could devise, or with which our stock of medicines
furnished us, without effect. John Sheilds observed that he had seen men in a similar
situation restored by violent sweats. Bratton requested that

Page 392
he might be sweated in the manner proposed by Sheilds to which we consented.
Sheilds sunk a circular hole of 3 feet diamiter and four feet deep in the earth. he
kindled a large fire in the hole and heated well, after which the fire was taken out a
seat placed in the center of the hole for the patient with a board at bottom for his
feet to rest on; some hoops of willow poles were bent in an arch crossing each over
the hole, on these several blankets were thrown forming a secure and thick orning of
about 3 feet high. the patient being striped naked was seated under this orning in the
hole and the blankets well secured on every side. the patient was furnished with a
vessell of water which he sprinkles on the bottom and sides of the hole and by that
means creates as much steam or vapor as he could possibly bear, in this situation he
was kept about 20 minutes after which he was taken out and suddonly plunged in
cold water twise and was then immediately returned to the sweat hole where he was
continued three quarters of an hour longer then taken out covered up in several
blankets and suffered to cool gradually. during the time of his being in the sweat
hole, he drank copious draughts of a strong tea of horse mint. Sheilds says that he
had previously seen the tea of Sinneca snake root used in stead of the mint which
was now employed for the want of the other which is not to be found in this country.
this experiment was made yesterday; Bratton feels himself much better and is
walking about today and says he is nearly free from pain.
at 11 A. M. a canoe arrived with 3 of the natives one of them the sick man of whom I
have before made mention as having lost the power of his limbs. he is a cheif of
considerable note among them and they seem extreemly anxious for his recovery. as
he complains of no pain in any particular part we conceive it cannot be the
rheumatism, nor do we suppose that it can be a parelitic attack or his limbs would
have been more deminished. we have supposed that it was some disorder which
owed it's origine to a diet of particular roots perhaps and such as we have never
before witnessed. While at the village of the broken arm we had recommended a diet
of fish or flesh for this man and the cold bath every morning. we had also given him
a few dozes of creem of tarter and flour of sulphur to be repeated every 3d day. this
poor wretch thinks that he feels himself somewhat better but to me there appears to
be no visible alteration. we are at a loss what to do for this unfortunate man. we
gave him a few drops of Laudanum and a little portable soup.

Page 393
4 of our party pased the river and visited the lodge of the broken Arm for the
purpose of traiding some awls which they had made of the links of [a] small chain
belonging to one of their steel traps, for some roots. they returned in the evening
having been very successfull, they had obtained a good supply of roots and bread of
cows. this day has proved warmer than any of the preceeding since we have arrived
here.
[Clark] SUNDAY 25H MAY 1806
rained moderately the greater part of last night and this morning untill 6 A.M. The
child is not so well to day as yesterday. I repeeted the creem of tarter and the onion
poltice. I caused a swet to be prepared for the Indn. in the same hole which bratten
had been swetted in two days past
One of our men purchased a Bear skin of the nativs which was nearly of a cream
coloured white. this skin which was the skin of an animal of the middle size of bears
together with the defferent sizes colours &c. of those which have been killed by our
hunters give me a stronger evidence of the various coloured bear of this country
being one species only, than any I have heretofore had. the poil of these bear were
infinately longer finer & thicker than the black bear their tallons also longer & more
blunt as worn by digging roots. the bear here is far from being as passive as the
common black bear, they have atacked and fought our hunters already but not so
fiercely as those of the Missouri. There are also some of the common black bear in
this neighbourhood tho no[t] so common as the other species. we attempted to swet
the sick indian but could not suckceed. he was not able either to set up or be
supported in the place prepared for him. I therefore deturmined to inform the nativs
that nothing but sefere [severe] swetts would restore this disabled man, and even
that doubtfull in his present situation.
MONDAY 26TH MAY 1806
The child something better this morning tho the swelling yet continue. we still apply
the onion poltice. I derected what should be done for the disabled man, gave him a
fiew doses of creem of tarter & flour sulphur, and some portable supe and directed
that he should be taken home & swetted &c. one of our men saw a salmon in the
river today, and two others eat of salmon at the near

Page 394
village which was brought from Lewis's river. our canoe finished and put into the
water. it will carry 12 men. the [river] riseing very fast and snow appear to melt on
the mountains.
[Lewis] TUESDAY MAY 27TH 1806
Early this morning we sent Reubin Feilds in surch of the horse which the indians had
given us to kill. at 10 in the morning he returned with the horse and we killed and
butchered him; he was large and in good order. Hohâstillpilp told us that most of the
horses we saw runing at large in this neighbourhood belonged to himself and his
people, and whenever we were in want of meat he requested that we would kill any
of them we wished; this is a piece of liberallity which would do honour to such as
bo[a]st of civilization; indeed I doubt whether there are not a great number of our
countrymen who would see us fast many days before their compassion would excite
them to a similar act of liberallity.
Charbono's son is much better today, tho' the swelling on the side of his neck I
believe will terminate in an ugly imposthume [abscess] a little below the ear. the
indians were so anxious that the sick Cheif should be sweated under our inspection
that they requested we would make a second atte[m]pt today; accordingly the hole
was somewhat enlarged and his father a very good looking old man, went into the
hole with him and sustained him in a proper position during the operation; we could
not make him sweat as copiously as we wished. after the operation he complained of
considerable pain, we gave him 30 drops of laudanum which soon composed him
and he rested very well. this is at least a strong mark of parental affection. they all
appear extreemly attentive to this sick man nor do they appear to relax their
asciduity towards him notwithstand[ing] he has been sick and helpless upwards of
three years. the Chopunnish appear to be very attentive and kind to their aged
people and treat their women with more rispect than the nations of the Missouri.
[Clark] WEDNESDAY MAY 28TH 1806
We sent Goodrich to the village of the broken arm for hair to stuff saddle pads. Jo. &
R. Fields set out this morning to hunt to-

Page 395
wards the mountains. at noon Shabono York and Lapage returned, they had
obtained 4 bags of the dried roots of Cowse and some bread. in the evening Collins,
Shannon & Colter returned with 8 deer. deer were very abundant they informed us,
but there was not many bear. The Sick Chief is much better this morning he can use
his hands and arms and seems much pleased with the prospects of recovering, he
says he feels much better than he has done for a great number of months. I sincerly
wish that the swetts may restore him. I have consented to repeet the sweets.
The Chopunnish held a council in the morning of the 12th among themselves in
respect to the Subject on which we had spoken to them the day before,2 the result
as we learnt was favourable, they placed confidence in the information they had
recived and resolved to pursue our advice. after this council was over the principal
chief or the broken arm, took the flour of the roots of Cows and thickened the Soup
in the Kittles and baskets of all his people, this being ended he made a harangue the
purpote of which was makeing known the deliberations of their councils and
impressing the necessity of unanimity among them, and a strict attention to the
resolution which had been agreed on in councell; he concluded by enviting all such
men as had resolved to abide by the decree of the councill to come and eat, and
requested such as would not be so bound to show themselves by not partakeing of
the feast. I was told by one of our men who was present in the house, that there
was not a decenting voice on this great national question, but all swallowed their
objections if any they had, very cheerfully with their mush. dureing the time of this
loud animated harangue of the Chief the women cryed wrung their hands, tore their
hair and appeared to be in the utmost distress.
after this cerimoney was over, the Chiefs and considerate men came in a body to
where we were seated at a little distance from our tent, and two young men at the
instance of the nation presented Capt L. and myself each a fine horse. and informed
us that they had listened with attention to what we had said and were resolved to
pursue our counsels &c. that as we had not seen the Black foot Indians and the
Menetarees of Fort de Prarie they did not think it safe to venter over to the plains of
the Missouri, where they would fondly go provided those nations would not kill them.

Page 396
that when we had established a tradeing house on the Missouri as we had promised
they would come over and trade for arms amunition &c. and live about us. that it
would give them much pleasure to be at peace with those nations altho' they had
shed much of their blood. They said that they were pore but their hearts were good.
we might be assured of their sincerety Some of their brave men would go over with
us to the Missouri and bring them the news as we wished, and if we could make a
peace between themselves and their enimies on the other side of the mountains their
nation would go over to the Missouri in the latter end of the summer. on the subject
of one of their chiefs accompanying us to the land of the White men they could not
yet determine, but that they would let us know before we left them. that the Snow
was yet so deep in the mountains that if we attempted to pass, we would certainly
perish, and advised us to remain untill after the next full moon when the snow would
disappear on the South hill sides and we would find grass for our horses.
Shabonos child is better this day than he was yesterday. he is free from fever. the
imposthume is not so large but seems to be advanceing to meturity.
FRIDAY MAY 30TH 1806
Lapage and Shabono set out early this morning to the Indian Village in order to trade
with them for roots; Serjt. Gass was sent this morning to obtain some goats hair to
stuff the pads of our Saddles. Shannon and Collins were permited to pass the river in
order to trade with the nativs and lay in a store of roots and bread for themselves
with their proportion of the merchendize as others had done; on landing on the
opposit shore the canoe was driven broad side with the full force of a very strong
current against some Standing trees and instantly filled with water and sunk. Potts
who was with them is an indifferent swimmer, it was with dificuelty he made the
land. they lost three blankets and a Blanket Cappo and their pittance of merchindize.
in our bear state of clothing this was a serious loss. all our invalides are on the
recovery. we gave the sick Chief a severe Swet to day, shortly after which he could
move one of his legs and thy's and work his toes pritty well, the other leg he can
move a little; his fingers and arms seem to be al-

Page 397
most entirely restored. he seems highly delighted with his recovery. I begin to
entertain strong hope of his recovering by these sweats.
one of the men brought me to day some onions from the high plains of a different
species from those near the borders of the river as they are also from the shive or
small onion noticed below the Falls of Columbia. these onions were as large as an
nutmeg, they generally grow double or two bulbs connected by the same tissue of
radicles; each bulb has two long line[a]r flat solid leaves. this onion is exceedingly
crisp and delicately flavoured indeed. I think more sweet and less strong than any I
ever tasted, it is not yet perfectly in blume, the parts of the flower are not distinct.
SUNDAY JUNE 1ST 1806
This morning Geo: Drewyer accompanied by Hohâstillpilp set out in serch of two
tomahawks of ours which we have understood were in the possession of certain
indians resideing at a distance in the plains on the South Side of Flat Head river; one
is a pipe tomahawk which Cap L. left at our camp on Musquetor Creek and the other
was stolen from the whilst we lay at the forks of this and Chopunnish rivers last fall.
Colter and Willard set out this morning on a hunting excurtion towards the
quawmash grounds beyond Collins creek. we begin to feel some anxiety with respect
to Sergt. Ordway and party who were sent to Lewis's river for salmon; we have
receved no intellegence of them since they set out. we desired Drewyer to make
some enquiry after the Twisted hair; the old man has not been as good as his word
with respect to encamping near us, and we fear we shall be at a loss to procure
guides to conduct us by the different routs we wish to pursue from Travillers rest to
the waters of the Missouri.
MONDAY JUNE 2ND 1806
McNeal and York were sent on a tradeing voyage over the river this morning. having
exhosted all our merchindize we were obliged to have recourse to every Subterfuge
in order to prepare in the most ample manner in our power to meet that wretched
portion of our journey, the Rocky Mountains, where hungar and Cold in their most
rigorous form assail the waried traveller; not any of

Page 398
us have yet forgotten our sufferings in those mountains in September last, I think it
probable we never shall. Our traders McNeal and York are furnished with the buttons
which Capt L. and my self cut off of our coats, some eye water and Basilicon which
we made for that purpose and some phials of eye water and some tin boxes which
Capt L. had brought from Philadelphia. in the evening they returned without about 3
bushels of roots and some bread haveing made a suckcessfull voyage, not much less
pleasing to us than the return of a good cargo to an East India merchant.
Drewyer arived this evening with Neeshneparkkeeook [Cut Nose] and Hohashillpilp
who had accompanied him to the lodge of the person who had our tomahawks. he
obtained both the tomahawks principally by the influence of the former of those
Chiefs. the one which had been stolen we prized most as it was the private property
of the late Serjt. Floyd and I was desirous of returning it to his friends. The man who
had this tomahawk had purchased it from the man who had stolen it, and was
himself at the moment of their arival just expireing. his relations were unwilling to
give up the tomahawk as they intended to bury it with the deceased owner, but were
at length [induced] to do so for the consideration of a handkerchief, two strands of
beeds, which drewyer gave them and two horses given by the Chiefs to be Killed
agreeable to their custom at the grave of the deceased. a Wife of
Neeshneeparkkeeook died some short time sence, himself and her relations
sacrificed 28 horses to her.
about noon Sergt. Ordway Frazier and Wiser returned with 17 salmon and some
roots of the cows; the distance was so great from whence they brought the fish, that
most of them were nearly spoiled. those fish were as fat as any I ever saw;
sufficiently so to cook themselves without the addition of Grease or butter; those
which were sound were extreemly delicious; their flesh is of a fine rose colour with a
small admixture of yellow. our horses are all recovering & I have no hesitation in
declareing that I believe that the Indian method of guilding [is] preferable to that
practised by ourselves.
TUESDAY JUNE 3RD 1806
Our invalids are all on the recovery; bratten is much stronger and can walk about
with considerable ease. the Indian chief ap-

Page 399
pears to be gradually recovering the use of his limbs, and the child is nearly well; the
inflomation on his neck continues but the swelling appears to subside. we still
continue the application of the onion poltice. To day the Indians dispatched an
express over the mountains to Travellers rest or to the neighbourhood of that creek
on Clark's river in order to learn from a band of Flat-Heads who inhabit that river and
who have probably wintered on Clarks river near the enterance of travellers rest
Creek, the occurences which have taken place on the East side of the mountains
dureing last winter. this is the band which we first met with on that river. the
mountains being practicable for this express we thought it probable that we could
also pass, but the Chiefs informs us that several of the Creek's would yet swim our
horses, that there was no grass and that the road was extreemly deep and slipery;
they inform us that we may pass conveniently in twelve or fourteen days. we have
come to a resolution to remove from hence to the quawmash Grounds beyond Colins
Creek on the 10th to hunt in that neighbourhood a fiew days, if possible lay in a
stock of meat, and then attempt the mountains about the middle of this month. I
begin to lose all hope of any dependance on the Salmon as this river will not fall
sufficiently to take them before we shall leave it, and as yet I see no appearance of
their running near the shore as the indians informed us they would in the course of a
fiew days.
THURSDAY JUNE 5TH 1806.
Colter and Bratten were permitted to visit the Indian Village to day for the purpose of
tradeing for roots and bread, they were fortunate and made a good return. We gave
the Indian Chief another sweat to-day, continuing it as long as he could bear it, in
the evening he was very languid but still [continued] to improve in the use of his
limbs. the Child is recovereing fast. I applied a plaster of sarve [salve] made of the
rozen of the long leafed pine, Beaswax and Bears oil mixed, which has subsided the
inflomation entirely, the part is considerably swelled and hard. in the evening Reuben
Fields, G. Shannon, Labiech, & Collins returned from the chaise and brought with
them five deer and a brown Bear.

[Clark] SUNDAY JUNE 8TH 1806
The Sick Chief is much mended, he can bear his weight on his legs and recovers
strength. the Child has nearly recovered. The Cut nose and ten or 12 came over
today to visit us, two of those were of the tribes from the plains of Lewis's river
whome we had not before seen; one of those men brought a horse [for] which I
gave a tomahawk which I had exchanged for with the chief of the Clahclahlah's
Nation below the Great rapids of Columbia, and [a] broken-down horse which was
not able to cross the mountains. we also exchanged 2 of our indifferent horses for
sound back horses. in the evening several foot races were run by the men of our
party and the Indians; after which our party devided and played at prisoners base
untill night. after dark the fiddle was played and the party amused themselves in
danceing. one of those Indians informed us that we could not cross the mountains
untill the full of the next moon; or about the 1st of July. if we attempted it Sooner
our horses would be three days without eating, on the top of the Mountns. this
information is disagreeable to us, in as much as it admits of some doubt, as to the
time most proper for us to Set out. at all events we Shall Set out at or about the time
which the indians Seem to be generally agreed would be the most proper. about the
middle of this month.
TUESDAY JUNE 10TH 1806.
rose early this morning and had all the horses collected except one of Whitehouses
horses which could not be found, an Indian

Page 401
promised to find the horse and bring him on to us at the quawmash fields at which
place we intend to delay a fiew days for the laying in some meat by which time we
calculate that the Snows will have melted more off the mountains and the grass
raised to a sufficient hight for our horses to live. We packed up and Set out at 11 A M
we set out with the party each man being well mounted and a light load on a 2d
horse, besides which we have several supernumary horses in case of accident or the
want of provisions, we therefore feel ourselves perfectly equiped for the Mountains.
we assended the hills which are very high and about three miles in extent. the pass
of Collins Creek was deep and extreemly difficult tho' we passed without sustaining
further injury than wetting some of our roots and bread. The Country through which
we passed is extreemly fertile and generally free from Stone, is well timbered with
several Species of fir, long leafed pine and Larch. the undergrowth is choke cherry
near the watercourses, black alder, a large species of red root now in blume, a
Growth which resembles the poppaw in it's leaf, and which bears a berry with five
valves of a deep purple colour, two species of shoemate, seven bark, perple haw,
service berry, Goose berry, wildrose, honey suckle which bears a white berry, and a
Species of dwarf pine which grows about 10 or 12 feet high. after we encamped this
evening we Sent out our hunters; Collins killed a doe on which we Suped much to
our satisfaction, we had not reached the top of the river hills before we were
overtaken by a party of 8 Indians who informed me that they were gowing to the
quawmash flatts to hunt; their object I belive is the expectation of being fed by us in
which however kind as they have been we must disappoint them at this moment as
it is necessary that we should use all frugallaty as well as employ every exertion to
provide meat for our journey. they have encamped with us.
THURSDAY JUNE 12TH 1806.
All our hunters except Gibson returned about noon; none of them had killed any
thing except Shields who brought with him two deer. the days are very worm and
the Musquetors our old companions have become very troublesome.
The Cutnose informed us on the 10th before we left him that two young Chiefs would
overtake us with a view to accompany us to

Page 402
the Falls of the Missouri and probably to the Seat of our governmt. our camp is
agreeably situated in a point of timbered land on the eastern borders of an extensive
leavel and butifull prarie which is intersected by several small branches near the bank
of one of which our camp is placed. the quawmash is now in blume at a Short
distance it resembles a lake of fine clear water, so complete is this deseption that on
first Sight I could have sworn it was water.
[Lewis] SATURDAY JUNE 14TH 1806.
We had all our articles packed up and made ready for an early departure in the
morning. our horses were caught and most of them hubbled and otherwise confined
in order that we might not be detained. from hence to traveller's rest we shall make
a forsed march; at that place we shal probably remain one or two days to rest
ourselves and horses and procure some meat. we have now been detained near five
weeks in consequence of the snows; a serious loss of time at this delightfull season
for traveling. I am still apprehensive that the snow and the want of food for our
horses will prove a serious imbarrassment to us as at least four days journey of our
rout in these mountains lies over hights and along a ledge of mountains never intirely
destitute of snow. every body seems anxious to be in motion, convinced that we
have not now any time to delay if the calculation is to reach the United States this
season; this I am detirmined to accomplish if within the compass of human power.
[Clark] SUNDAY JUNE 15TH 1806.
Collected our horses early with the intention of makeing an early Start. Some hard
Showers of rain detained us we took our final departu[r]e from the quawmash fields
and proceeded with much dificuelty owing to the Situation of the road which was
very sliprey, and it was with great dificulty that the loaded horses Could assend the
hills and Mountains the[y] frequently sliped down both assending and decending
those steep hills. the rain seased and sun shown out. after detaining about 2 hours
we proceeded on passing over some ruged hills or Spurs of the rocky Mountain,
passing the

Page 403
Creek on which I encamped on the 17th Sept. last. we passed through bad fallen
timber and a high Mountain this evening. from the top of this Mountain I had an
extensive view of the rocky Mountains to the South and the Columbian plains for [a]
great extent also the SW. Mountains and a range of high Mountains which divides the
waters of Lewis's & Clarks rivers and seems to termonate nearly a West cours[e].
MUNDAY 16TH JUNE 1806
Collected our horses early and Set out 7 AM proceeded on up the Creek through a
gladey swompy bottom covered with grass and quawmash and through most
intolerable bad fallen timber over a high Mountain on which great quantity of Snow is
yet lying premisquissly through the thick wood, and in maney places the banks of
snow is 4 feet deep. we no[o]ned it or dined on a small creek in a small open Vally
where we found some grass for our horses to eate, altho' serounded by snow This
morning Windsor bursted his rifle near the Muzzle. Vegitation is propotionable
backward; the dog tooth Violet is just in blume, the honeysuckle, huckleberry and a
small Species of white maple are beginning to put forth their leaves, where they are
clear of the Snow, those appearances in this comparratively low region augers but
unfavourably with respect to the practibility of passing the Mountains, however we
deturmine to proceed, accordingly after takeing a hasty meal we set out and
continued our rout through a thick wood much obstructed with fallen timber, and
interupted by maney Steep reveins and hills which wer very high.
the Snow has increased in quantity so much that the great part of our rout this
evening was over the Snow which has become sufficiently firm to bear our horses,
otherwise it would have been impossible for us to proceed as it lay in emince masses
in some places 8 or ten feet deep. We found much difficulty in finding the road, as it
was so frequently covered with snow. we arived early in the evening at the place I
had killed and left the flesh of a horse for the party in my rear last Septr. here is a
Small glade in which there is some grass, not a Sufficency of [for] our horses, but
we thought it adviseable to remain here all night as we apprehended if we proceeded
further we should find less grass. The

Page 404
air is pleasant in the course of the day, but becomes very cold before morning
notwithstanding the shortness of the night.
TUESDAY JUNE 17TH 1806
We collected our horses and set out early; we found it dificuelt and dangerous to
pass the creek in consequence of it's debth and rapidity; we avoided two other
passes of the creek, by assending a steep rockey and difficuelt hill. beyond this creek
the road assends the mountain to the hight of the main leading ridges, which divides
the waters of the Kooskooske and Chopunnish Riv's. This mountain we ascended
about 3 miles when we found ourselves invelloped in snow from 8 to 12 feet deep
even on the South Side of the mountain. I was in front and could only prosue the
derection of the road by the trees which had been peeled by the nativs for the iner
bark of which they scraped and eate, as those pealed trees were only to be found
scattered promisquisley, I with great difficulty prosued the direction of the road one
mile further to the top of the mountain where I found the snow from 12 to 15 feet
deep, but fiew trees with the fairest exposure to the Sun; here was Winter with all
it's rigors; the air was cold my hands and feet were benumed.
we knew that it would require four days to reach the fish weare at the enterance of
Colt Creek, provided we were so fortunate as to be enabled to follow the p[r]oper
ridge of the mountains to lead us to that place; of this all of our most expert
woodsmen and principal guides were extreemly doubtfull; Short of that point we
could not hope for any food for our horses not even under wood itself as the whole
was covered many feet deep in snow. if we proceeded and Should git bewildered in
those Mountains the certainty was that we Should lose all of our horses and
consequently our baggage enstrements perhaps our papers and thus eventially
resque the loss of our discoveries which we had already made if we should be so
fortunate as to escape with life. the snow bore our horses very well and the traveling
was therefore infinately better than the obstruction of rocks and fallen timber which
we met with in our passage over last fall when the snow lay on this part of the ridge
in detached spop[t]s only.
under these circumstances we conceived it madness in this stage of

Page 405
the expedition to proceed without a guide who could certainly conduct us to the
fishwears on the Kooskooske, as our horses could not possibly sustain a journey of
more than 4 or 5 days without food. we therefore come to the resolution to return
with our horses while they were yet strong and in good order, and indeaver to keep
them so untill we could precure an indian to conduct us over the Snowey Mountains,
and again to proceed as soon as we could precure such a guide, knowing from the
appearance of the snows that if we remained untill it had disolved sufficiently for us
to follow the road that we should not be enabled to return to the United States within
this season. having come to this resolution, we ordered the party to make a deposit
of all the baggage which we had not imediate use for, and also all the roots and
bread of Cows which they had except an allowance for a fiew days to enable them to
return to some place at which we could subsist by hunting untill we precured a
guide. we left our instrements, and I even left the most of my papers believing them
safer here than to Wrisk them on horse back over the road, rocks and water which
we had passed.
our baggage being laid on Scaffolds and well covered, we began our retragrade
march at 1 P. M. haveing remaind. about three hours on this Snowey mountain. we
returned by the rout we had advanced to hungary Creek, which we assended about
2 miles and encamped. we had here more grass for our horses than the proceeding
evening, yet it was but scant. the party were a good deel dejected, tho' not as much
so as I had apprehended they would have been. this is the first time since we have
been on this tour that we have ever been compelled to retreat or make a retragrade
march.
WEDNESDAY JUNE 18TH 1806
We dispatched Drewyer and Shannon to the Chopunnish Indians in the plains beyond
the Kooskooske in order to hasten the arrival of the Indians who promised to
accompany us, or to precure a guide at all events and rejoin us as soon as possible.
We sent by them a riffle [rifle] which we offered as a reward to any of them who
would engage to conduct us to Clarks river at the entrance of Travellers rest Creek;
we also directed them if they found difficuelty in induceing any of them to
accompany us to offer the reward of two other guns to be given them immediately
and ten horses at the falls of Missouri.

Page 406
we had not proceeded far this morning before J. Potts cut his leg very badly with one
of the large knives; he cut one of the large veins on the iner side of the leg; Colters
horse fell with him in passing hungary creek and himself and horse were driven down
the Creek a considerable distance roleing over each other among the rocks. he
fortunately escaped with[out] much injurey or the loss of his gun. he lost his
blanket. at 1 P. M. we returned to the glade on a branch of hungary creek where we
had dined on the 16th instant. here we again halted and dined. after dinner we
proceeded on to the near fork of Collins Creek and encamped in a pleasant situation
at the upper part of the Meadows about 2 miles above our encampment of the 15
inst. we sent out several hunters but they returned without having killed any thing.
they saw a number of large fish in the creek and shot at them several times without
suckcess. we hope by the means of the fish together with what deer and bear we
can kill to be enabled to subsist untill our guide arives without the necessaty of
returning to the quawmash flats. there is great abundance of good food here to
sustain our horses. we are in flattering expectations of the arrival of two young
chiefs who informed us that they intended to accompany us to the U. States, and
Should Set out from their village in 9 nights after we left them [or] on the 19th inst. if
they set out at that time Drewyer & Shannon will meet them, and probably join us on
the 20th or 21st Musquetors Troublesome.
FRIDAY JUNE 20TH 1806
Labiesh & Crusat returned late in the evening with one deer which the former had
killed. the hunters assured us that their greatest exertions would not enable them to
support us here more than one or two days longer, from the great scercity of game
and the dificuelt access of the Country, the under brush being very thick and great
quantities of fallen timber. as we shall necessarily be compelled to remain more than
two days for the return of Drewyer & Shannon we determine to return in the morning
as far as the quawmash flatts, and endeaver to lay in another stock of meat for the
Mountains, our former stock now being nearly exhosted as well as what we have
killed on our rout.
by returning to the quawmash flatts we shall sooner be informed wheather or not we
can procure a guide to conduct us through the

Page 407
Mountains; Should we fail in precureing one, we are deturmined to wrisk a passage
on the following plan immediately, because should we wait much longer, or untill the
Snow disolves in such a manner as to enable us to follow the road we cannot expect
to reach the U, States this Winter; this is that Capt L. or myself shall take four of our
most expert woodsmen with 3 or four of our best horses and proceed two days in
advance takeing a plentifull supply of provisions. for this party to follow the road by
the mark the indi[a]ns have made in many places with their baggage on the Sides of
the trees by rubbing against them, and to blaize the trees with a tomahawk as they
proceed. that after proceeding two days in advance of Hungary Creek, two of those
men would be sent back to the party who by the time of their return to hungary
Creek would have reached that place. the men So returning would be enabled to
inform the main party of the probable suckcess of the proceeding party in finding the
road and of their probable progress, in order that should it be necessary, the main
party by a delay of a day or two a[t] hungary Creek, should give the advance time to
make the road through before the main party could overtake them, and thus prevent
delay on that part of the rout where no food is to be obtained for our horses. Should
it so happen that the advance should not find the road by the marks of the trees
after attempting it for two days, the whole of them would return to the main party. in
which Case we would bring back our baggage and attempt a passage over the
Mountains through the Country of the Shoshones further to the South, by way of the
main S Westerly fork of Lewis's river and Madisons or Gallitins river's, where from
the information of the Chopunnish, there is a passage where [which] at this season
of the year is not obstructed by snow, though the round is very distant and would
require at least a month in it's performance. The Shoshones informed us when we
first met with them that there was a passage across the Mountains in that quarter
but represented the difficuelties arriseing from Steep ruggid high Mountains, and also
an extensive and barren plain which was to be passed without game, as infinitely
more difficuelt than the rout by which we came.
SATURDAY JUNE 21ST 1806
We collected our horses early and Set out on our return to the flatts. we all felt some
mortification in being thus compelled to

Page 408
retrace our Steps through this tedious and difficuelt part of our rout, obstructed with
brush and innumerable logs and fallen timber which renders the traveling distressing
and even dangerous to our horses. at the pass of Collin's Creek we met two indians
who were on their way over the mountains, they had brought with themm the three
horses and the Mule which had left us and returned to the quawmash ground. as well
as we could understand the indians they informed us they had Seen Geo. Drewyer &
Shannon, and that they would not return untill the expiration of two days. the cause
why Drewyer & Shannon did not return with these men we are at a loss to account
for. we pressed those indians to remain with us and conduct us over the Mountains
on the return of Drewyer & Shannon. they consented to remain two nights for us and
accordingly deposited their Stores of roots & Bread in the bushes at no great
distance and after Dinner returned with us, as far as the little prarie about 2 Miles
distance from the Creek, here they halted with their horses and informed us they
would remain untill we overtook them or at least 2 nights. at 7 in the evening we
found ourselves once more at our old encampment where we Shall anxiously await
the return of Drewyer & Shannon.
MONDAY JUNE 23RD 1806
Apprehensive from Drewyer & Shannons delay that they had met with some
difficuelty in precureing a guide, and also that the two indians who had promised to
wait two nights for us would set out today, we thought it most adviseable to dispatch
Wizer & Frazier to them this morning with a view if possible to detain them a day or
two longer; and directed that in the event of their not being able to detain the
indians, that Sergt. Gass, Jo. & R. Fields & Wiser should accompany the Indians by
whatever rout they might take to travellers rest and blaize the trees well as they
proceeded, and wait at that place untill our arival with the party. at 4 P. M. Shannon
Drewyer & Whitehouse returned. Shannon & Drewyer brought with them three
indians who had consented to accompany us to the falls of the Missouri for the
Compensation of 2 guns. one of those men is the brother of the cutnose and the
other two are the Same who presented Capt L. and myself with a horse on a former
occasion at the Lodge of the broken arm, and the two who

Page 409
promised to pursue us in nine nights after we left the river, or on the 19th inst.
Those are all young men of good Charrector and much respected by their nation.
TUESDAY JUNE 24TH 1806
We collected our horses early this morning and set out accompanied by our 3
guides. Colter joined us this morning haveing killed a Bear, which from his discription
of it's poverty and distance we did not think proper to send after. We nooned it as
usial at Collin's Creek where we found Frazier, solus; the other four men haveing
gorn in pursute of the two indians who had set out from Collin's Creek two hours
before Fraziers arrival. after dinner we continued our rout to fish Creek here we
found Sargt. Gass, Wiser and the two indian men whome they had prevail'd on to
remain at that place untill our arival; Jos. & R. Fields had killed one Small deer only,
and of this they had been liberal to the indians insomuch that they had no
provisions; they had gorn on to the branch of hungary creek at which we shall noon
it tomorrow in order to hunt. we had fine grass for our horses this evening.
WEDNESDAY JUNE 25TH 1806
last evening the indians entertained us with setting the fir trees on fire. they have a
great number of dry limbs near their bodies which when Set on fire create a very
sudden and emmence blaize from bottom to top of those tall trees.1 they are a
boutifull object in this situation at night. this exhibition remi[n]de[d] me of a display
of firewo[r]ks. the nativs told us that their object in Setting those trees on fire was to
bring fair weather for our journey. We collected our horses and set out at an early
hour this morning. one of our guides complained of being unwell, a Symptom which I
did not much like as such complaints with an indian is generally the prelude to his
abandoning any enterprize with which he is not well pleased. we left 4 of those
indians at our encampment they promised to pursue us in a fiew hours. at 11 A.M.
we arrived at the branch of hungary Creek where we found Jo. & R. Fields. they
1 Clearly the highly inflammable Alpine fir, Abies lasiocarpa.

Page 410
had not killed anything. here we halted and dined and our guides overtook us. at this
place the squaw collected a parcel of roots of which the Shoshones Eat. it is a small
knob root a good deel in flavour and consistency like the Jerusolem artichoke. after
dinner we continued our rout to hungary creek and encamped about one and a half
miles below our Encampment of the 61th [sic] inst: The indians all continue with us
and I beleive are disposed to be faithfull to their engagements. Capt. L. gave the sick
indian a small buffalow robe which he brought from the Missouri, this indian having
no other Covering except his mockersons and a dressed Elk skin without the hair.
THURSDAY JUNE 26TH 1806
We collected our horses and set out early and proceeded on Down hungary Creek a
fiew miles and assended to the summit of the mountain where we deposited our
baggage on the 17th inst. found everything safe and as we had left them. the Snow
which was 10 feet 10 inches deep on the top of the mountain, had sunk to 7 feet tho'
perfectly hard and firm. we made some fire cooked dinner and dined, while our
horses stood on snow 7 feet deep at least. after dinner we packed up and proceeded
on. the Indians hastened us off and informed us that it was a considerable distance
to the place they wished to reach this evening where there was grass for our horses.
accordingly we Set out with our guides who led us over and along the Steep Sides of
tremendious Mountains entirely covered with Snow except about the roots of the
trees where the Snow was partially melted and exposed a small spot of earth.
we assended and decended several steep lofty hights but keeping on the dividing
ridge of the Chopunnish & Kooskooske river we passed no Stream of water. late in
the evening much to the Satisfaction of ourselves and the Comfort of the horses we
arived at the desired Spot and Encamped on the steep side of a Mountain convenient
to a good Spring. here we found an abundance of fine grass for our horses. this
Situation was the Side of an untimbered mountain with a fair Southern aspect where
the snow from appearance had been disolved about 10 days, the grass was young
and tender of course and had much the appearance of the Green Swoard. there is a
great abundance of [a] Species of beargrass which

Page 411
grows on every part of those Mountains, its growth is luxuriant and continues green
all winter but the horses will not eate it. Soon after we had encamped we were
overtaken by a Chopunnish man who had pursued us with a view to accompany Capt
Lewis to the falls of Missouri. we were now informed that the two young men we met
on the 21st and detained several days were going on a party of pleasure mearly to
the Oat-lash-shoots or as they call them Shalees a band of the Tush-she-pâh Nation
[Flatheads] who reside on Clarks river in the neighbourhood of the Mouth of
Travelers rest. I was taken yesterday with a violent pain in my head which has
tormented me ever since most violently.
FRIDAY JUNE 27TH 1806
the road Still continue[d] on the hights of the Dividing ridge on which we had
traveled yesterday for 9 Ms. or to our encampment of the 16th Septr. last. about 1
M. short of the encampment we halted by the request of the Guides a fiew minits on
an ellevated point and smoked a pipe on this eminance the nativs have raised a conic
mound of Stons of 6 or 8 feet high and erected a pine pole of 15 feet long. from this
place we had an extencive view of these Stupendeous Mountains principally covered
with snow like that on which we stood; we were entirely serounded by those
mountains from which to one unacquainted with them it would have Seemed
impossible ever to have escaped, in short without the assistance of our guides, I
doubt much whether we who had once passed them could find our way to Travellers
rest in their present situation for the marked trees on which we had placed
considerable reliance are much fewer and more difficuelt to find than we had
apprehended. those indians are most admireable pilots; we find the road wherever
the snow has disappeared tho' it be only for a fiew paces.
after haveing smoked the pipe and contemplating this Scene Sufficient to have
dampened the Sperits of any except such hardy travellers as we have become, we
continued our march and at the dist[ance] of 3 M. decended a steep Mountain and
passed two small branches of the Chopunnish river just above their fo[r]k, and again
assend the ridge on which we passed. at the distance of 7 M. arived at our
Encampment of 16th Septr. last passed 3 small branches passed on a dividing ridge
rugid and we arived at a Situation very

Page 412
similar to our situation of last night tho' [as] the ridge was somewhat higher and the
snow had not been so long disolved of course there was but little grass. here we
Encamped for the night haveing traveled 28 Ms. over these mountains without
releiving the horses from their packs or their haveing any food. our Meat being
exhosted we issued a point of Bears Oil to a mess which with their boiled roots made
an agreeable dish. Jo. Potts leg which had been much Swelled and inflaimed for
several days is much better this evening and givs him but little pain. we applied the
pounded root & leaves of wild ginger from which he found great relief. My head has
not pained me so much to day as yesterday and last night.
SATURDAY JUNE 28TH 1806
we continued our rout along the dividing ridge over knobs & through deep hollows
passed our encampmt of the 14 Sept. last near the forks of the road leaving the one
on which we had come one leading to the fishery to our right imediately on the
dividing ridge. at 12 oClock we arived at an untimberd. side of a mountain with a
southern aspect just above the fishery here we found an abundance of grass for our
horses as the guid[e]s had informed us. as our horses were hungary and much
fatiegued and from information no other place where we could obtain grass for them
within the reach of this evening's travel we deturmined to remain at this place all
night haveing come 13 M. only. the water was distant from our Encampment we
therefore melted snow and used the water. the whole of the rout of this day was
over deep Snow. we find the travelling on the Snow not worse than without it, as
[the] easy passage it givs us over rocks and fallen timber fully compensates for the
inconvenience of sliping, certain it is that we travel considerably faster on the snow
than without it. the snow sinks from 2 to 3 inches with a horse, is course and firm
and seems to be formed of the larger particles of the Snow; the Surface of the Snow
is reather harder in the morning than after the sun shines on it a fiew hours, but it is
not in that situation so dense as to prevent the horses from obtaining good foothold.
SUNDAY JUNE 29TH 1806
We colected our horses and Set out haveing previously dispatched Drewyer & R.
Fields to the warm Springs to hunt. we

Page 413
prosued the hights of the ridge on which we have been passing for several days; it
termonated at the distance of 5 Ms. from our encampment, and we decended to &
passed the Main branch of Kooskooke 1 1\2 Ms. above the enterance of Glade Creek
which falls in on the N. E. side. we bid adew to the Snow. near the River we found a
Deer which the hunters had killed and left us. this was a fortunate supply as all our
bears oil was now exhosted and we were reduced to our roots alone without salt.
beyond this river we assended a steep Mountain about 2 Miles to it's sumit where we
found the old road which we had passed on as we went out, comeing in on our right,
the road was now much plainer and much beaten. at noon we arived at the
quawmash flatts on Vally Creek and halted to graize our horses and dined haveing
traveled 12 miles here is a pretty little plain of about 50 acres plentifully stocked with
quawmash and from appearance this forms one of the principal Stages of the indians
who pass the mountains on this road. after dinner we continued our march 7 Ms
further to the worm Springs where we arrived early in the evening.
Those Worm or Hot Springs are Situated at the base of a hill of no considerable
hight, on the N. Side and near the bank of travellers rest Creek which is at that place
about 10 yds wide.2 these Springs issue from the bottom and through the interstices
of a grey freestone rock, the rock rises in irregular masy clifts in a circular range,
arround the Springs on their lower Side. imediately above the Springs on the creek
there is a handsom little quawmash plain of about 10 acres. the principal spring is
about the temperature of the Warmest baths used at the Hot Springs in Virginia. in
this bath which had been prepared by the Indians by stopping the river with Stone
and mud, I bathed and remained in 10 minits it was with dificuelty I could remain
this long and it causd. a profuse swe[a]t. two other bold Springs adjacent to this are
much warmer, their heat being so great as to make the hand of a person Smart

Same as that of the hotest of the hot Springs of Virginia. both the Men and the
indians amused themselves with the use of the bath this evening. I observe after the
indians remaining in the hot bath as long as they could bear it run and plunge
themselves into the creek the water of which is

MONDAY JUNE 30TH 1806
just as we had prepard. to set out at an early hour, a deer came in to lick at the
Springs and one of our hunters killed it; this secured to us our dinner. and we
proceeded down the Creek, sometimes in the bottoms and at other times on the
tops or along the Steep sides of the ridge to the N. of the Creek. at 1 1\2 M. we
passd our encampment of the 12th of Septr. last. we noon'd it at the place we had
on the 12 of Septr. last whiles here Shields killed a deer on the N. fork near the road.
after dinner we resumed our march. soon after setting out Shields killed another
deer, and we picked up 3 others which G Drewyer had killed along the road. Deer
are very abundant in the neighbourhood of travellers rest of boath Species, also
some big horn and Elk. a little before Sunset we arrived at our old encampment on
the S. side of the Creek a little above its enterance into Clarks river.3 here we
Encamped with a view to remain 2 days in order to rest ourselves and horses and
make our final arrangements for Seperation. we found no signs of the Oatlashshots
haveing been here lately. the Indians express much concern for them and apprehend
that the Minetarries of Fort d[e] Prarie have destroyed them in the course of the last
Winter and Spring, and mention the tracts of the bearfooted indians which we saw
yesterday as an evidence of their being much distressed. our horses have stood the
journey suprisinly well and only want a fiew days rest to restore them.
During the winter at Fort Clatsop Lewis and Clark had decided that when they
returned to Traveller's Rest, where they now are, they would divide the party in
order to make two essential explorations which they had not made on the westward
journey. They now work out the details.
Lewis is to traverse the route to the Great Falls which they are

sure is shorter and better than the one they took outbound. He will go up the
Hellgate and Blackfoot Rivers, cross the divide, and go down to the Great Falls by
way of either Dearborn or Sun River. Then he will explore Marias River, to ''ascertain
whether any branch . . . lies as far north'' as 50°. (This represents the fixed purpose
to find a navigable affluent of the Missouri by which the carriage of Canadian furs
can be diverted to American ports.) To accompany him he now selects Gass,
Drewyer, the two Fields brothers, Frazier, and Werner. Besides these, Thompson,
Goodrich, and McNeal will go with him as far as the Great Falls portage, where they
will raise the cache, put the equipment in order, and await the detachment of Clark's
force that is to join them there.
Clark will take the rest of the party to the forks of the Beaverhead, where the boats
were left last fall. After the boats have been put in condition, he will select a
detachment to take them to the Great Falls and help those whom Lewis has left
there portage the whole outfit round the falls. (These two detachments will then
descend the Missouri by boat to the general rendezvous, the mouth of the
Yellowstone, picking up Lewis and his small party at the mouth of the Marias.) Clark
will take the others overland to the Yellowstone and down it to some point where it
appears to become navigable. From that point he will send Sergeant Pryor with the
horses to the mouth of the Yellowstone. After making dugouts, he and the others
will take them down the Yellowstone to its mouth.
[Lewis] WEDNESDAY JULY 2ED 1806.
in the course of the day we had much conversation with the [Nez Percé] indians by
signs, our only mode of communicating our ideas. they informed us that they wished
to go in surch of the Cotslashshoots their friends and intended leaving us tomorrow
morning, I prevailed on them to go with me as far as the East branch of Clark's River
and put me on the road to the Missouri. I gave the Cheif a medal of the small size;
he insisted on exchanging names with me according to their custom which was
accordingly done and I was called Yo-me-kol-lick which interpreted is the white
bearskin foalded.4 in the evening the indians run their horses, and we

had several foot races between the natives and our party with various success. these
are a race of hardy strong athletic active men. Goodrich and McNeal are both very
unwell with the pox which they contracted last winter with the Chinnook women this
forms my inducement principally for taking them to the falls of the Missouri where
during an interval of rest they can use the murcury freely.
[Clark] WEDNESDAY JULY 2ND 1806
We gave the second gun to our guides agreeable to our promis, and to each we gave
Powder & ball I had the greater part of the meat dried for to subsist my party in the
Mountains between the head of Jeffersons & Clarks rivers where I do not expect to
find any game to kill. had all of our arms put in the most prime order two of the rifles
have unfortunately bursted near the muscle [muzzle], Shields cut them off and they
shute tolerable well one which is very short we exchange with the Indian whoe he
had given a longer gun to induce them to pilot us across the Mountains. we caused
every man to fill his horn with powder & have a sufficiency of Balls &c. the last day in
passing down Travellers rest Creek Capt. Lewis fell down the side of a Steep
Mountain near 40 feet but fortunately receved no damage. his hors was near falling
on him but fortunately recovered and they both escaped unhurt.

Lewis's Short-Cut to the Missouri, and Exploration of Maria's River
[Lewis] THURSDAY JULY 3RD 1806.
All arrangements being now compleated for carrying into effect the several scheemes
we had planed for execution on our return, we saddled our horses and set out I took
leave of my worthy friend and companion Capt. Clark and the party that
accompanyed him. I could not avoid feeling much concern on this occasion although
I hoped this separation was only momentary. I proceeded down Clark's river [the
Bitterroot] seven miles with my party of nine men and five indians. here the Indians
recommended our passing the river which was rapid and 150 yds. wide. 2 miles
above this place I passed the entrance of the East branch of Clark's River [the
Hellgate] which discharges itself by two channels; the water of this river is more
terbid than the main stream and is from 90 to 120 yds. wide. as we had no other
means of passing the river we busied ourselves collecting dry timber for the purpose
of constructing rafts; timber being scarce we found considerable difficulty in
procuring as much as made three small rafts. the Indians swam over their horses
and drew over their baggage in little basons of deer skins which they constructed in
a very few minutes for that purpose. we drove our horses in after them and they
followed to the opposite shore. I remained myself with two men who could scarcely
swim untill the last; by this time the raft by passing so frequently had fallen a
considerable distance down the river to a rapid and difficult part of it crouded with
several small Islands and willow bars which were now overflown; with these men I
set out on the raft and was soon hurried down with the current a mile

Page 419
and a half before we made shore, on our approach to the shore the raft sunk and I
was drawn off the raft by a bush and swam on shore the two men remained on the
raft and fortunately effected a landing at some little distance below. I now joined the
party and we proceeded with the indians about 3 Ms. to a small Creek and encamped
at sunset. I sent out the hunters who soon returned with three very fine deer of
which I gave the indians half.
These people now informed me that the road which they shewed me at no great
distance from our Camp would lead us up the East branch of Clark's river and [to] a
river they called Cokahlarishkit or the river of the road to buffaloe and thence to
medicine river and the falls of the Missouri where we wished to go. they alledged that
as the road was a well beaten track we could not now miss our way and as they
were affraid of meeting with their enimies the Minnetares they could not think of
continuing with us any longer, that they wished now to proceed down Clark's river in
surch of their friends the Shalees. they informed us that not far from the dividing
ridge between the waters of this and the Missouri rivers the roads forked they
recommended the left hand as the best rout but said they would both lead us to the
falls of the Missouri.1 I directed the hunters to turn out early in the morning and
indeavour to kill some more meat for these people whom I was unwilling to leave
without giving them a good supply of provision after their having been so obliging as
to conduct us through those tremendious mountains. the musquetoes were so
excessively troublesome this evening that we were obliged to kindle large fires for
our horses these insects torture them in such manner untill they placed themselves
in the smoke of the fires that I realy thought they would become frantic.
We saw the fresh track of a horse this evening in the road near our camp which the
indians supposed to be a Shale spye. we killed a prarie hen with the short and
pointed tail she had a number of young which could just fly.
FRIDAY JULY 4TH 1806.
at half after eleven the hunters returned from the chase unsucessfull. I now ordered
the horses saddled smoked a pipe with

Page 420
these friendly people and at noon bid them adieu. they had cut the meat which I
gave them last evening thin and exposed it in the sun to dry informing me that they
should leave it in this neighbourhood untill they returned as a store for their
homeward journey. it is worthy of remark that these people were about to return by
the same pass by which they had conducted us through the difficult part of the
Rocky Mountains, altho they were about to decend Clark's river several days journey
in surch of the Shale's their relations, a circumstance which to my mind furnishes
sufficient evidence that there is not so near or so good a rout to the plains of
Columbia by land along that river as that which we came. the several war routs of
the Minetarees which fall into this vally of Clark's river concenter at traveller's rest
beyond which point they have never yet dared to venture in pursuit of the nations
beyond the mountains. these affectionate people our guides betrayed every
emmotion of unfeigned regret at seperating from us; they said that they were
confidint that the Pahkees, (the appellation they give to the Minnetares) would cut us
off. the first 5 miles of our rout was through a part of the extensive plain in which we
were encamped, we then entered the mountains with the East fork of Clark's river
through a narrow confined pass2 on it's N. side continuing up that river five Ms.
further to the entrance of the Cokahlahishkit R. which falls in on the N. E. side, is 60
yds. wide deep and rapid. the banks bold not very high but never overflow. the East
fork below its junction with this stream is 100 yds. wide and above it about 90. the
water of boath are terbid but the East branch much the most so; their beds are
composed of sand and gravel; the East fork possesses a large portion of the former.
neither of those streams are navigable in consequence of the rapids and shoals
which obstruct their currents. thus far a plain or untimbered country bordered the
river which near the junction of these streams spread into a handsome level plain of
no great extent; the hills were covered with long leafed pine and fir. I now continued
my rout up the N. side of the Cokaplahishkit river through a timbered country for 8
miles and encamped in a handsom bottom on the river where there was an
abundance of excellent grass for our horses. the evening was fine, air pleasant and
no musquetoes. a

Page 421
few miles before we encamped I killed a squirrel of the speceis common to the Rocky
Mountains and a ground squirrel of a speceis which I had never before seen, I
preserved the skins of both of these animals.
For the next five days Lewis's journal consists merely of the courses, bearings, and
distances of the trail he is following, plus a few brief, hastily jotted notes. The party
come upon fresh tracks which they take to be those of a band of "Pahkees" (Atsina,
the Gros Ventres) returning to their own country from a horse-stealing raid. They
"are therefore much on our guard both day and night." Lewis recognizes the trail,
described by both the Minnetarees and the Nez Percés, that leads to Dearborn River
but continues on to another one, also repeatedly described to him, that will lead to
Medicine (Sun) River. Following this, on July 7 he crosses ''the dividing ridge
between the waters of the Columbia and Missouri rivers'' by the pass now called
Lewis and Clark's. The next day, coming down to the plains, he abandons the
well-worn trail in order to hunt, "to procure the necessary skins to make geer and
meat for the three men we mean to leave at the falls as none of them are hunters."
They are back in the country of abundant game.
[Lewis] JULY 10TH 1806.
great quantities of prickly pear of two kinds on the plains. the ground is rendered so
miry by the rain which fell yesterday that it is excessively fatiegueing to the horses to
travel. we came 10 miles and halted for dinner the wind blowing down the river in
the fore part of the day was unfavourable to the hunters. they saw several gangs of
Elk but they having the wind of them ran off. in the evening the wind set from the
West and we fell in with a few elk of which R. Fields and myself killed 3 one of which
swam the river and fell on the opposit [side] so we therefore lost it's skin I sent the
packhorses on with Sergt. Gass directing them to halt and encamp at the first timber
which proved to be about 7 Ms. I retained frazier to assist in skining the Elk. we
wer[e] about this time joined by drewer. a large brown bear swam the river near
where

Page 422
we were and Drewyer shot and killed it. by the time we butchered the[s]e 2 elk and
bar it was near dark we loaded our horses with the best of the meat and pursued the
party and found them encamped as they had been directed in the first timber. we did
not reach them until 9 P.M. they informed us that they had seen a very large bear in
the plains which had pursued Sergt. Gass and Thomson some distance but their
horses enabled them to keep out of it's reach. they were affraid to fire on the bear
least their horses should throw them as they were unaccustomed to the gun. we
killed five deer 3 Elk and a bear to day saw vast herds of buffaloe in the evening
below us on the river. we hered them bellowing about us all night. vast assemblages
of wolves. saw a large herd of Elk making down the river. passed a considerable
rapid in medicine river after dark. the river about a hundred yards wide is deep and
in many parts rappid and today has been much crouded with islands.
JULY 11TH 1806.
I sent the hunters down Medicine river to hunt Elk and proceeded with the party
across the plain to the white bear Islands.3 it is now the season at which the buffaloe
begin to coppelate and the bulls keep a tremendious roaring we could hear them for
many miles and there are such numbers of them that there is one continual roar. our
horses had not been acquainted with the buffaloe they appeared much allarmed at
their appearance and bellowing. when I arrived in sight of the white-bear Islands the
missouri bottoms on both sides of the river were crouded with buffaloe I sincerely
beleif that there were not less than 10 thousand buffaloe within a circle of 2 miles
arround that place. I directed the hunters to kill some buffaloe as well for the benifit
of their skins to enable us to pass the river as for their meat for the men I meant to
leave at this place. we unloaded our horses and encamped opposite to the Islands.
had some willow sticks collected to make canoes of the hides by 12 OCk. they killed
eleven buffaloe most of them in fine order. the bulls are now generally much fatter
than the cows and are fine beef. by 3 in the evening. we

had brought in a large quantity of fine beef and as many hides as we wanted for
canoes shelters and geer. I then set all hands to prepare two canoes the one we
made after the mandan fassion with a single skin in the form of a bason and the
other we constructed of two skins on a plan of our own.
JULY 12TH. 1806.
We arrose early and resumed our operations in compleating our canoes which we
completed by 10 A. M. about this time two of the men whom I had dispatched this
morning in quest of the horses returned with seven of them only. the remaining ten
of our best horses were absent and not to be found. I fear that they are stolen. I
dispatch[ed] two men on horseback in surch of them. at Noon Werner returned
having found three others of the horses Sergt. Gass did not return until 3 P.M. not
having found the horses. he had been about 8 ms. up Medecine river. I now
dispatched Joseph Fields and Drewyer in quest of them the former returned at dark
unsuccessfull and the latter continued absent all night. at 5 P.M. the wind abated and
we transported our baggage and meat to the opposite shore in our canoes which we
found answered even beyond our expectations. we swam our horses over also and
encamped at sunset. the grass and weeds are much more luxouriant than they were
when I left this place on the 13th of July 1805.

removed above to my old station opposite the upper point of the white bear island.

had the cash [cache] opened found my bearskins entirly destroyed by the water, the
river having risen so high that the water had penitrated. all my specimens of plants
also lost. the Chart of the Missouri fortunately escaped. opened my trunks and boxes
and exposed the articles to dry. found my papers damp and several articles damp.
the stoper had come out of a phial of laudinum and the contents had run into the
drawer and distroyed a gre[a]t part of my medicine in such manner that it was past
recovery. waited very impatiently for the return of Drewyer he did not arrive.

Had the carriage wheels dug up. found them in good order. the iron frame of the
boat had not suffered materially. had the meat cut thiner and exposed to dry in the
sun. the old cash being too damp to venture to deposit my trunks &c. in I sent them
over to the Large island and had them put on a high scaffold among some think
brush and covered with skins. I take this precaution lest some indians may visit the
men I leave here before the arrival of the main party and rob them. the hunters killed
a couple of wolves, the buffaloe have almost entirely disappeared. saw the bee
martin. the wolves are in great numbers howling arround us and loling about in the
plains in view at the distance of two or three hundred yards.
TUESDAY JULY 15TH 1806.
Dispatched McNeal early this morning to the lower part of portage in order to learn
whether the Cash and white perogue remained untouched or in what state they
were. the men employed in drying the meat, dressing deerskins and preparing for
the reception of the canoes. at 1 P.M. Drewyer returned without the horses and
reported that after a diligent surch of 2 days he had discovered where the horses
had passed Dearborn's river at which place there were 15 lodges that had been
abandoned about the time our horses were taken; he pursued the tracks of a
number of horses from these lodges to the road which we had traveled over the
mountains which they struck about 3 ms. South of our encampment of the 7th inst.
and had pursued this road Westwardly; I have no doubt but they are a party of the
Tushapahs who have been on a buffaloe hunt. his horse being much fatiegued with
the ride he had given him and finding that the indians had at least 2 days the start of
him thought it best to return. his safe return has releived me from great anxiety. I
had already settled it in my mind that a white-bear had killed him and should have
set out tomorrow in surch of him, and if I could not find him to continue my rout to
Maria's river. I knew that if he met with a bear in the plains even he would attack
him. and that if any accedent should happen to seperate him from his horse in that
situation the chances

Page 425
in favour of his being killed would be as 9 to 10. I felt so perfectly satisfyed that he
had returned in safety that I thought but little of the horses although they were
seven of the best I had. this loss great as it is, is not intirely irreparable, or at least
dose not defeat my design of exploring Maria's river. I have yet 10 horses remaining,
two of the best and two of the worst of which I leave to assist the party in taking the
canoes and baggage over the portage and take the remaining 6 with me; these are
but indifferent horses most of them but I hope they may answer our purposes. I
shall leave three of my intended party, (viz) Gass, Frazier and Werner, and take the
two Feildses and Drewyer. by having two spare horses we can releive those we ride.
having made this arrangement I gave orders for an early departure in the morning,
indeed I should have set out instantly but McNeal road one of the horses which I
intend to take and has not yet returned.
a little before dark McNeal returned with his musquet broken off at the breach, and
informed me that on his arrival at willow run [on the portage] he had approached a
white bear within ten feet without discover[ing] him the bear being in the thick
brush, the horse took the allarm and turning short threw him immediately under the
bear; this animal raised himself on his hinder feet for battle, and gave him time to
recover from his fall which he did in an instant and with his clubbed musquet he
struck the bear over the head and cut him with the guard of the gun and broke off
the breech, the bear stunned with the stroke fell to the ground and began to scratch
his head with his feet; this gave McNeal time to climb a willow tree which was near at
hand and thus fortunately made his escape. the bear waited at the foot of the tree
untill late in the evening before he left him, when McNeal ventured down and caught
his horse which had by this time strayed off to the distance of 2 Ms. and returned to
camp. these bear are a most tremenduous animal; it seems that the hand of
providence has been most wonderfully in our favor with rispect to them, or some of
us would long since have fallen a sacrifice to their farosity. there seems to be a
sertain fatality attatched to the neighbourhood of these falls, for there is always a
chapter of accedents prepared for us during our residence at them.
the musquetoes continue to infest us in such manner that we can scarcely exist; for
my own part I am confined by them to my bier

at least 3/4ths of my time. my dog even howls with the torture he experiences from
them, they are almost insupportable, they are so numerous that we frequently get
them in our thr[o]ats as we breath.
WEDNESDAY JULY 16TH 1806.
I dispatched a man early this morning to drive up the horses as usual, he returned at
8 A. M. with one of them only. allarmed at this occurrence I dispatched one of my
best hands on horseback in surch of them he returned at 10 A.M. with them and I
immediately set out. sent Drewyer and R. Fields with the horses to the lower side of
Medecine river, and proceeded myself with all our baggage and J. Fields down the
missouri to the mouth of Medecine river in our canoe of buffaloe skins we were
compelled to swim the horses above the whitebear island and again across medicine
river as the Missouri is of great width below the mouth of that river. having arrived
safely below Medicine river we immediately sadled our horses and proceeded down
the river to the handsome fall of 47 feet where I halted about 2 hours and took a
haisty sketch of these falls; in the mean time we had some meat cooked and took
dinner after which we proceeded to the grand falls where we arrived at sunset. on
our way we saw two very large bear on the opposite side of the river. as we arrived
in sight of the little wood below the falls we saw two other bear enter it; this being
the only wood in the neighbourhood we were compelled of course to contend with
the bear for possession, and therefore left our horses in a place of security and
entered the wood which we surched in vain for the bear, they had fled. here we
encamped and the evening having the appearance of rain made our beds and slept
under a shelving rock. these falls have abated much of their grandure since I first
arrived at them in June 1805, the water being much lower at prese[n]t than it was at
that moment, however they are still a sublimely grand object.
THURSDAY JULY 17TH 1806.
I arrose early this morning and made a drawing of the falls. after which we took
breakfast and departed. it being my design to

Page 427
strike Maria's river about the place at which I left it on my return to it's mouth in the
beginning of June 1805. I steered my course through the wide and level plains which
have somewhat the appearance of an ocean, not a tree nor a shrub to be seen. the
land is not fertile, at least far less so, than the plains of the Columbia or those lower
down this river, we killed a buffaloe cow as we passed throug[h] the plains and took
the hump and tonge which furnish ample rations for four men one day. at 5 P. M. we
arrived at rose river [the Teton] where I purposed remaining all night as I could not
reach maria's river this evening and unless I did there would be but little probability
of our finding any wood and very probably no water either. on our arrival at the river
we saw where a wounded and bleading buffaloe had just passed and concluded it
was probable that the indians had been runing them and were near at hand. the
Minnetares of Fort de prarie and the blackfoot indians rove through this quarter of
the country and as they are a vicious lawless and reather an abandoned set of
wretches I wish to avoid an interview with them if possible. I have no doubt but they
would steel our horses if they have it in their power and finding us weak should they
happen to be numerous wil most probably attempt to rob us of our arms and
baggage; at all events I am determined to take every possible precaution to avoid
them if possible. I hurried over the river to a thick wood and turned the horses to
graize; sent Drewyer to pursue and kill the wounded buffaloe in order to determine
whether it had been wounded by the indians or not, and proceeded myself to
reconnoitre the adjacent country having sent R. Fields for the same purpose a
different rout. I ascended the river hills and by the help of my glass examined the
plains but could make no discovery, in about an hour I returned to camp, where I
met with the others who had been as unsuccessfull as myself. Drewyer could not
find the wounded buffaloe. J. Fields whom I had left at camp had already roasted
some of the buffaloe meat and we took dinner after which I sent Drewyer and R.
Fields to resume their resurches for the indians; and set myself down to record the
transactions of the day. the bed of this stream is small gravel and mud; it's banks
are low but never overflow, the hills are about 100 or 150 feet high; it possesses
bluffs of earth like the lower part of the Missouri; except the debth and valocity of it's
stream and it is the Missouri in

Page 428
miniture. from the size of rose river at this place and it's direction I have no doubt
but it takes it's source within the first range of the Rocky mountains.
FRIDAY JULY 18TH 1806.
We set out this morning a little before sunrise ascended the river hills and continued
our rout as yesterday through the open plains at about 6 miles we reached the top of
an elivated plain which divides the waters of the rose river from those of Maria's
river. our course led us nearly parrallel with a creek of Maria's river which takes it's
rise in these high plains at the place we passed them; at noon we struck this creek
about 6 ms. from its junction with Maria's river where we found some cottonwood
timber; here we halted to dine and graize our horses. we passed immence herds of
buffaloe on our way in short for about 12 miles it appeared as one herd only the
whole plains and vally of this creek being covered with them; saw a number of
wolves of both speceis, also Antelopes and some horses. after dinner we proceeded
about 5 miles across the plain to Maria's river where we arrived at 6 P. M. being now
convinced that we were above the point to which I had formerly ascended this river
and f[e]aring that a fork of this stream might fall in on the North side between this
place and the point to which I had ascended it, I directed Drewyer who was with me
on my former excurtion, and Joseph Fields to decend the river early in the morning
to the place from whence I had returned, and examine whether any stream fell inn or
not. I keep a strict lookout every night, I take my tour of watch with the men.
SATURDAY JULY 19TH 1806.
Drewyer and J. Fields set out early this morning in conformity to my instructions last
evening. they returned at 1\2 after 12 OCk. and informed me that the course of the
river from hence downwards as far as they were is N. 80. E. we set out, ascended
the river hills having passed the river and proceeded through the open plains up the
N. side of the river 20 miles and encamped. at 15 miles we passed a large creek on
N. side a little above it's entrance; there is but little running water in this creek at
present, it's

Page 429
bed is about 30 yds. wide and appears to come from the broken Mountains. so called
from their raggid and irregular shape4 there are three of them extending from east to
West almost unconnected, the center mountain terminates in a conic spire and is
that which I have called the tower mountain they are destitute of timber. the plains
are beautifull and level but the soil is but thin.
SUNDAY JULY 20TH 1806.
We set [out] at sunrise and proceed[ed] through the open plain as yesterday up the
North side of the river. the plains are more broken than they were yesterday and a
great quanty of small gravel is every where distributed over the surface of the earth
which renders travling extreemly painfull to our bearfoot horses. the mineral salts
common to the plains of the missouri has been more abundant today than usual. the
bluffs of the river are about 200 feet high, steep irregular and formed of earth which
readily desolves with water, slips and precipitates itself into the river as before
mentioned frequently of the bluffs of the Missouri below which they resemble in
every particular, differing essencially from those of the Missouri above the entrance
of this river, they being composed of firm red or yellow clay which dose not yield
readily to the rains and a large quantity of rock. the soil of the river bottom is fertile
and well timbered, I saw some trees today which would make small canoes. from the
apparent decent of the country to the North and above the broken mountains I am
induced to beleive that the South branch of the Suskashawan receives a part of it's
waters from the plain even to the borders of this river and from the brakes [breaks]
visible in the plains in a no[r]thern direction think that a branch of that river
decending from the rocky mountains passes at no great distance from Maria's river
and to the N. E. of the broken mountains.5 the day has proved excessively warm
and we lay by four hours during the heat of it; we traveled 28 miles
4 The Sweetgrass Hills. Lewis's "broken mountains" and "raggid and irregular
shape" apply with much greater force to the range only a few miles to his left,
which has been namd the Lewis Mountains for him.
5 A mistake induced by Lewis's urgent desire to reach the Saskatchewan
watershed. The drainage north of his present position is actually that of Milk
River.

and encamped as usual in the river bottom on it's N. side. there is scarcely any water
at present in the plains and what there is, lies in small pools and is so strongly
impregnated with the mineral salts that it is unfit for any purpose except the uce of
the buffaloe. those animals appear to prefer this water to that of the river.
MONDAY JULY 21ST 1806.
We set out at sunrise and proceeded a short distance up the North side of the river,
we found the ravines which made in on this side were so steep and numerous that
we passed the river in doing which the pack horse which carried my instruments
missed the ford and wet the instruments. this accident detained us about half an
ho]u]r. I took the Instruments out wiped them and dryed their cases. they sustained
no material injury. at 2 P. M. we struck a northern branch of Maria's river about 30
yds. wide at the distance of about 8 miles from it's entrance. this stream is closely
confined between clifts of freestone rocks the bottom narrow below us and above
the rocks confine it on each side; some little timber below but not any above; the
water of this stream is nearly clear. from the appearance of this rock and the
apparent hight of the bed of the streem I am induced to beleive that there are falls in
these rivers somewhere about their junction. being convinced that this stream came
from the mountains I determined to pursue it as it will lead me to the most
no[r]thern point to which the waters of Maria's river extend which I now fear will not
be as far north as I wished and expected. after dinner we set out up the North
branch keeping on it's S. side; we pursued it untill dark and not finding any timber
halted and made a fire of the dung of the buffaloe. we lay on the south side in a
narrow bottom under a Clift. our provision is nearly out, we wounded a buffaloe this
eve ning but could not get him.
TUESDAY JULY 22ED 1806.
we continued up the river on it's South side for 17 miles when we halted to graize
our horses and eat; there being no wood we were compelled to make our fire with
the buffaloe dung which I found answered the purpose very well. we cooked and eat
all the

Page 431
meat we had except a small peice of buffaloe meat which was a little tainted. after
dinner we passed the river and took our course through a level and beautifull plain
on the N. side. the country has now become level, the river bottoms wide and the
adjoining plains but little elivated above them; the banks of the river are not usually
more than from 3 to four feet yet it dose not appear ever to overflow them. we found
no timber untill we had traveled 12 miles further when we arrived at a clump of large
cottonwood trees in a beautifull and extensive bottom of the river about 10 miles
below the foot of the rocky Mountains where this river enters them; as I could see
from hence very distinctly where the river entered the mountains and the bearing of
this point being S of West I thought it unnecessary to proceed further and therefore
encamped resolving to rest ourselves and horses a couple of days at this place and
take the necessary observations.6
this plain on which we are is very high; the rocky mountains to the S. W. of us
appear but low from their base up yet are partially covered with snow nearly to their
bases. there is no timber on those mountains within our view; they are very irregular
and broken in their form and seem to be composed principally of clay with but little
rock or stone.7 the river appears to possess at least double the vollume of water
which it had where we first arrived on it below; this no doubt proceeds from the
avapporation caused by the sun and air and the absorbing of the earth in it's passage
through these open plains. I believe that the waters of the Suskashawan apporoach
the borders of this river very nearly. I now have lost all hope of the waters of this
river ever extending to N. Latitude 50° though I still hope and think it more than
probable that both white earth river and milk river extend as far north as latd. 50°
we have seen but few buffaloe today no deer and very few Antelopes; gam[e] of
every discription is extreemly wild which induces me to beleive that the indians are
now, or have been lately in this neighbourhood. we wounded a buffaloe this evening
but our horses were so much fatiegued that we were unable to pursue it with
success.

Marias watershed would take him north of 49° and afford easy access to the

WEDNESDAY JULY 23RD 1806.
I dispatched Drewyer an[d] Joseph fields this morning to hunt. I directed Drewyer
who went up the river [Cut Bank Creek] to observe it's bearings and the point at
which it entered the mountains, this he did and on his return I observed the point at
which the river entered to bear S. 50° W. distant about ten miles the river making a
considerable bend to the West just above us. Drewyer informed us that there was an
indian camp of eleven leather lodges which appeared to have been abandoned about
10 days, the poles only of the lodges remained. we are confident that these are the
Minnetares of fort de prarie and suspect that they are probably at this time
somewhere on the main branch of Maria's river on the borders of the buffaloe, under
this impression I shall not strike that river on my return untill about the mouth of the
North branch.
THURSDAY JULY 24TH 1806.
At 8 A. M. the sun made it's appearance for a few minutes and I took it's altitude but
it shortly after clouded up again and continued to rain the ballance of the day I was
therefore unable to complete the observations I wished to take at this place. I
determined to remain another day in the hope of it's being fair. the air has become
extreemly cold which in addition to the wind and rain renders our situation extreemly
unpleasant. several wolves visited our camp today, I fired on and wounded one of
them very badly. the small speceis of wolf barks like a dog, they frequently salute us
with this note as we pass through the plains.
FRIDAY JULY 25TH 1806.
The weather still continues cold cloudy and rainy, the wind also has blown all day
with more than usual violence from the N. W. late in the evening Drewyer and J.
Fields returned the former had killed a fine buck on which we now fared
sumptuously. they informed me that it was about 10 miles to the main branch of
Maria's River, that the vally formed by the river in that quarter was wide extensive
and level with a considerable quantity of timber; here they found some wintering
camps of the natives and a

Page 433
great number of others of a more recent date or that had from appearance been
evacuated about 6 weeks; we consider ourselves extreemly fortunate in not having
met with these people. I determined that if tomorrow continued cloudy to set out as
I now begin to be apprehensive that I shall not reach the United States within this
season unless I make every exertion in my power which I shall certainly not omit
when once I leave this place which I shall do with much reluctance without having
obtained the necessary data to establish it's longitude as if the fates were against me
my chronometer from some unknown cause stoped today, when I set her to going
she went as usual.
SATURDAY JULY 26TH 1806.
The mor[n]ing was cloudy and continued to rain as usual, tho' the cloud seemed
somewhat thiner I therefore posponed seting out untill 9 A. M. in the hope that it
would clear off but finding the contrary result I had the horses caught and we set out
biding a lasting adieu to this place which I now call camp disappointment. I took my
rout through the open plains S. E. 5 ms. passing a small creek at 2 ms. from the
mountains when I changed my direction to S. 75 E. for 7 ms. further and struck a
principal branch of Maria's river 65 yds. wide, not very deep, I passed this stream to
it's south side and continued down it 2 Ms. on the last mentioned course when
another branch of nearly the same dignity formed a junction with it, coming from the
S. W. I passed the S. branch just above it's junction and continued down the river
which runs a little to the N. of E. 1 ms. and halted to dine and graize our horses.
here I found some indian lodges which appeared to have been inhabited last winter
in a large and fertile bottom well stocked with cottonwood timber. during our stay at
this place R. Fields killed a buck a part of the flesh of which we took with us. after
dinner I continued my rout down the river to the North of Ea[s]t about 3 Ms. when
the hills puting in close on the S. side I determined to ascend them to the high plain
which I did accordingly, keeping the Fieldes with me; Drewyer passed the river and
kept down the vally of the river. I had intended to decend this river with it's course
to it's junction with the fork which I had ascended and from thence have taken
across the country obliquely to rose [Teton] river and decend that stream to it's
confluence with Maria's river.

Page 434
the country through which this portion of Maria's river passes to the fork which I
ascended appears much more broken than that above and between this and the
mountains. I had scarcely ascended the hills before I discovered to my left at the
distance of a mile an assembleage of about 30 horses. I halted and used my spye
glass by the help of which I discovered several indians on the top of an eminence
just above them who appeared to be looking down towards the river I presumed at
Drewyer. about half the horses were saddled. this was a very unpleasant sight,
however I resolved to make the best of our situation and to approach them in a
friendly manner. I directed J. Fields to display the flag which I had brought for that
purpose and advanced slowly toward them, about this time they discovered us and
appeared to run about in a very confused manner as if much allarmed, their attention
had been previously so fixed on Drewyer that they did not discover us untill we had
began to advance upon them, some of them decended the hill on which they were
and drove their horses within shot of it's summit and again returned to the hight as if
to wate our arrival or to defend themselves. I calculated on their number being
nearly or quite equal to that of their horses. that our runing would invite pursuit as it
would convince them that we were their enimies and our horses were so indifferent
that we could not hope to make our escape by flight; added to this Drewyer was
seperated from us and I feared that his not being apprized of the indians in the event
of our attempting to escape he would most probably fall a sacrefice.
under these considerations I still advanced towards them; when we had arrived
within a quarter of a mile of them, one of them mounted his horse and rode full
speed towards us, which when I discovered I halted and alighted from my horse; he
came within a hundred paces halted looked at us and turned his horse about and
returned as briskly to his party as he had advanced; while he halted near us I held
out my hand and becconed to him to approach but he paid no attention to my
overtures. on his return to his party they all decended the hill and mounted their
horses and advanced towards us leaving [other] horses behind them, we also
advanced to meet them. I counted eight of them but still supposed that there were
others concealed as there were several other horses saddled. I told the two men
with me that I apprehended that these were the Minnetares of Fort de Prarie and
from their known character I expected that we were to have some difficulty with
them;

Page 435
that if they thought themselves sufficiently strong I was convinced they would
attempt to rob us in which case be their numbers what they would I should resist to
the last extremity prefering death to that of being deprived of my papers instruments
and gun and desired that they would form the same resolution and be allert and on
their guard.
when we arrived within a hundred yards of each other the indians except one halted
I directed the two men with me to do the same and advanced singly to meet the
indian with whom I shook hands and passed on to those in his rear, as he did also to
the two men in my rear; we now all assembled and alighted from our horses; the
Indians soon asked to smoke with us, but I told them that the man whom they had
seen pass down the river had my pipe and we could not smoke untill he joined us. I
requested as they had seen which way he went that they would one of them go with
one of my men in surch of him, this they readily concented to and a young man set
out with R. Fields in surch of Drewyer. I now asked them by sighns if they were the
Minnetares of the North8 which they answered in the affermative; I asked if there
was any cheif among them and they pointed out 3 I did not believe them however I
thought it best to please them and gave to one a medal to a second a flag and to the
third a handkerchief, with which they appeared well satisfyed. they appeared much
agitated with our first interview from which they had scarcely yet recovered, in fact I
believe they were more allarmed at this accedental interview than we were. from no
more of them appearing I now concluded they were only eight in number and
became much better satisfyed with our situation as I was convinced that we could
mannage that number should they attempt any hostile measures.
as it was growing late in the evening I proposed that we should remove to the
nearest part of the river and encamp together, I told them that I was glad to see
them and had a great deel to say to them. we mounted our horses and rode towards
the river which was at but a short distance, on our way we were joined by Drewyer
Fields and the indian. we decended a very steep bluff about 250 feet high to the river
where there was a small bottom of nearly 1\2
8 Lewis interprets the sign as designating the Atsina, the Fall Indians or Gros
Ventres, who of course were not a Blackfoot tribe, though they were affiliated
with the Blackfeet. He appears to have been mistaken, however; they were a
group of Piegans, one of the three Blackfoot tribes.

Page 436
mile in length and about 250 yards wide in the widest part; in this bottom there
stand t[h]ree solitary trees near one of which the indians formed a large simicircular
camp of dressed buffaloe skins and invited us to partake of their shelter which
Drewyer and myself accepted and the Fieldses lay near the fire in front of the
she[l]ter. with the assistance of Drewyer I had much conversation with these people
in the course of the evening.9 I learned from them that they were a part of a large
band which lay encamped at present near the foot of the rocky mountains on the
main branch of Maria's river one 1\2 days march from our present encampment;10
that there was a whiteman with their band; that there was another large band of
their nation hunting buffaloe near the broken mountains and were on there way to
the mouth of Maria's river where they would probably be in the course of a few days.
they also informed us that from hence to the establishment where they trade on the
Suskasawan river is only 6 days easy march or such as they usually travel with their
women and childred[n] which may be estimated at about 150 ms. that from these
traders they obtain arm[s] amunition sperituous liquor blankets &c. in exchange for
wolves and some beaver skins.
I told these people that I had come a great way from the East up the large river
which runs towards the rising sun, that I had been to the great waters where the sun
sets and had seen a great many nations all of whom I had invited to come and trade
with me on the rivers on this side of the mountains, that I had found most of them at
war with their neighbours and had succeeded in restoring peace among them, that I
was now on my way home and had left my party at the falls of the missouri with
orders to decend that river to the entrance of Maria's river and there wait my arrival
and that I had come in surch of them in order to prevail on them to be at peace with
their neighbours particularly those on the West side of the mountains and to engage
them to come and trade with me when the establishment is made at the entrance of
this river to all which they readily gave their assent and declared it to be their wish to
be at peace with the Tushepahs whom they said had killed a number of their
relations lately and pointed to several of those present who had cut their hair as an
evidince of the truth of what they had asserted. I found them extreemly fond of
smoking and
9 That is, in sign language.
10 Probably a lie and probably told as a defensive measure.

Page 437
plyed them with the pipe untill late at night. I told them that if they intended to do as
I wished them they would send some of their young men to their band with an
invitation to their chiefs and warriors to bring the whiteman with them and come
down and council with me at the entrance of Maria's river and that the ballance of
them would accompany me to that place, where I was anxious now to meet my men
as I had been absent from them some time and knew that they would be uneasy
untill they saw me. that if they would go with me I would give them 10 horses and
some tobacco. to this proposition they made no reply, I took the first watch tonight
and set up untill half after eleven; the indians by this time were all asleep, I roused
up R. Fields and laid down myself; I directed Fields to watch the movements of the
indians and if any of them left the camp to awake us all as I apprehended they would
attampt to s[t]eal our horses. this being done I feel into a profound sleep and did not
wake untill the noise of the men and indians awoke me a little after light in the
morning.
Lewis has made a serious error in judgment, one which only remarkably good luck
enabled him and his party to survive. The Nez Percés and Flatheads had repeatedly
emphasized the hostility and aggressiveness of the Blackfeet and their affiliates the
Atsina. It was right to turn over his watch to Reuben Fields not to have done so
would have been an offensive if not indeed a hostile act and to appear to go to
sleep. But he ought to have stayed awake and on the alert. Furthermore, he ought
to have foreseen just such an attempt as the Indians made when they saw an
opportunity, and he ought so to have impressed the necessity of vigilance on his
men that no opportunity could have occurred.
JULY 27TH 1806. SUNDAY.
This morning at daylight the indians got up and crouded around the fire, J. Fields
who was on post had carelessly laid his gun down behi[n]d him near where his
brother was sleeping, one of the indians the fellow to whom I had given the medal
last evening sliped behind him and took his gun and that of his brother unperceived
by him, at the same instant two others advanced and seized the guns of Drewyer
and myself, J. Fields seeing this

Page 438
turned about to look for his gun and saw the fellow just runing off with her and his
brother's he called to his brother who instantly jumped up and pursued the indian
with whom they overtook at the distance of 50 or 60 paces from the camp s[e]ized
their guns and rested them from him and R. Fields as he seized his gun stabed the
indian to the heart with his knife the fellow ran about 15 steps and fell dead; of this I
did not know untill afterwards, having recovered their guns they ran back instantly to
the camp.
Drewyer who was awake saw the indian take hold of his gun and instantly jumped up
and s[e]ized her and rested her from him but the indian still retained his pouch, his
jumping up and crying damn you let go my gun awakened me I jumped up and
asked what was the matter which I quickly learned when I saw drewyer in a scuffle
with the indian for his gun. I reached to seize my gun but found her gone, I then
drew a pistol from my holster and terning myself about saw the indian making off
with my gun I ran at him with my pistol and bid him lay down my gun which he was
in the act of doing when the Fieldses returned and drew up their guns to shoot him
which I forbid as he did not appear to be about to make any resistance or commit
any offensive act, he droped the gun and walked slowly off, I picked her up instantly,
Drewyer having about this time recovered his gun and pouch asked me if he might
not kill the fellow which I also forbid as the indian did not appear to wish to kill us, as
soon as they found us all in possession of our arms they ran and indeavored to drive
off all the horses I now hollowed to the men and told them to fire on them if they
attempted to drive off our horses, they accordingly pursued the main party who were
dr[i]ving the horses up the river and I pursued the man who had taken my gun who
with another was driving off a part of the horses which were to the left of the camp. I
pursued them so closely that they could not take twelve of their own horses but
continued to drive mine with some others; at the distance of three hundred paces
they entered one of those steep nitches in the bluff with the horses before them
being nearly out of breath I could pursue no further, I called to them as I had done
several times before that I would shoot them if they did not give me my horse and
raised my gun, one of them jumped behind a rock and spoke to the other who
turned arround and stoped at the distance of 30 steps from me and I shot him
through the belly, he fell to his knees and on his wright elbow

Page 439
from which position he partly raised himself up and fired at me, and turning himself
about crawled in behind a rock which was a few feet from him. he overshot me,
being bearheaded I felt the wind of his bullet very distinctly.
not having my shotpouch I could not reload my piece and as there were two of them
behind good shelters from me I did not think it prudent to rush on them with my
pistol which I had discharged I had not the means of reloading untill I reached camp;
I therefore returned leasurly towards camp, on my way I met with Drewyer who
having heared the report of the guns had returned in surch of me and left the Fieldes
to pursue the indians, I desired him to haisten to the camp with me and assist in
catching as many of the indian horses as were necessary and to call to the Fieldes if
he could make them hear to come back that we still had a sufficient number of
horses, this he did but they were too far to hear him. we reached the camp and
began to catch the horses and saddle them and put on the packs. the reason I had
not my pouch with me was that I had not time to return about 50 yards to camp
after geting my gun before I was obliged to pursue the indians or suffer them to
collect and drive off all the horses. we had caught and saddled the horses and began
to arrange the packs when the Fieldses returned with four of our horses; we left one
of our horses and took four of the best of those of the indian's; while the men were
preparing the horses I put four sheilds and two bows and quivers of arrows which
had been left on the fire, with sundry other articles; they left all their baggage at our
mercy. they had but 2 guns and one of them they left the others were armed with
bows and arrows and eyedaggs.11 the gun we took with us. I also retook the flagg
but left the medal about the neck of the dead man that they might be informed who
we were. we took some of their buffaloe meat and set out ascending the bluffs by
the same rout we had decended last evening leaving the ballance of nine of their
horses which we did not want.
the Fieldses told me that three of the indians whom they pursued swam the river one
of them on my horse. and that two others ascended the hill and escaped from them
with a part of their horses, two I had pursued into the nitch one lay dead near the
camp and the eighth we could not account for but suppose that he ran off early in
the contest. having ascended the hill we took our course
11 Short axes: elsewhere, ''eye-dogs.''

Page 440
through a beatifull level plain a little to the S. of East. my design was to hasten to the
entrance of Maria's river as quick as possible in the hope of meeting with the canoes
and party at that place having no doubt but that they [the Indians] would pursue us
with a large party and as there was a band near the broken mountains or probably
between them and the mouth of that river we might expect them to receive
inteligence from us and arrive at that place nearly as soon as we could, no time was
therefore to be lost and we pushed our horses as hard as they would bear. at 8 miles
we passed a large branch 40 yds. wide which I called battle river. at 3 P. M. we
arrived at rose river about 5 miles above where we had passed it as we went out,
having traveled by my estimate compared with our former distances and cou[r]ses
about 63 ms. here we halted an hour and a half took some refreshment and suffered
our horses to graize; the day proved warm but the late rains had supplyed the little
reservors in the plains with water and had put them in fine order for traveling, our
whole rout so far was as level as a bowling green with but little stone and few prickly
pears.
after dinner we pursued the bottoms of rose river but finding[it] inconvenient to pass
the river so often we again ascended the hills on the S. W. side and took the open
plains; by dark we had traveled about 17 miles further, we now halted to rest
ourselves and horses about 2 hours, we killed a buffaloe cow and took a small
quantity of the meat. after refreshing ourselves we again set out by moonlight and
traveled leasurely, heavy thunderclouds lowered arround us on every quarter but
that from which the moon gave us light. we continued to pass immence herds of
buffaloe all night as we had done in the latter part of the day. we traveled untill 2
OCk in the morning having come by my estimate after dark about 20 ms. we now
turned out our horses and laid ourselves down to rest in the plain very much
fatiegued as may be readily conceived. my indian horse carried me very well in short
much better than my own would have done and leaves me with but little reason to
complain of the robery.
JULY 28TH 1806. MONDAY.
The morning proved fair, I slept sound but fortunately awoke as day appeared, I
awaked the men and directed the horses to be saddled, I was so soar from my ride
yesterday that I could

Page 441
scarcely stand, and the men complained of being in a similar situation however I
encouraged them by telling them that our own lives as well as those of our friends
and fellow travellers depended on our exertions at this moment; they were allert
soon prepared the horses and we again resumed our march; the men proposed to
pass the missouri at the grog spring where rose river approaches it so nearly and
pass down on the S. W. side, to this I objected as it would delay us almost all day to
reach the point12 by this circuetous rout and would give the enemy time to surprise
and cut off the party at the point if they had arrived there, I told them that we owed
much to the safety of our friends and that we must wrisk our lives on this occasion,
that I should proceed immediately to the point and if the party had not arrived that I
would raft the missouri a small distance above, hide our baggage and march on foot
up the river through the timber untill I met the canoes or joined them at the falls; I
now told them that it was my determination that if we were attacked in the plains on
our way to the point that the bridles of the horses should be tied together and we
would stand and defend them, or sell our lives as dear as we could.
we had proceeded about 12 miles on an East course when we found ourselves near
the missouri; we heard a report which we took to be that of a gun but we were not
certain; still continuing down the N. E. bank of the missouri about 8 miles further,
being then within five miles of the grog spring we heared the report of several rifles
very distinctly on the river to our right, we quickly repared to this joyfull sound and
on arriving at the bank of the river had the unspeakable satisfaction to see our
canoes coming down. we hurried down from the bluff on which we were and joined
them striped our horses and gave them a final discharge imbarking without loss of
time with our baggage. I now learned that they had brought all things safe having
sustaned no loss nor met with any accident of importance. Wiser had cut his leg
badly with a knife and was unable in consequence to work. we decended the river
opposite to our principal cash which we proceeded to open after reconnoitering the
adjacent country.
we found that the cash had caved in and most of the articles burried therin were
injured; I sustained the loss of two very large bear skins which I much regret; most
of the fur and baggage belonging to the men were injured. the gunpowder corn flour

12 The mouth of the Marias, where they were to meet the boats.

Page 442
and salt had sustained but little injury the parched meal was spoiled or nearly so.
having no time to air these things which they much wanted we droped down to the
point to take in the several articles which had been buried at that place in several
small cashes; these we found in good order, and recovered every article except 3
traps belonging to Drewyer which could not be found. here as good fortune would
have it Sergt. Gass and Willard who brought the horses from the falls joined us at 1
P. M. I had ordered them to bring down the horses to this place in order to assist
them in collecting meat which I direceted them to kill and dry here for our voyage,
presuming that they would have arrived with the perogue and canoes at this place
several days before my return. having now nothing to detain us we passed over
immediately to the island in the entrance of Maria's river to launch the red perogue,
but found her so much decayed that it was impossible with the means we had to
repare her and therefore mearly took the nails and other ironworks about her which
might be of service to us and left her. we now reimbarked on board the white
perog[u]e and five small canoes and decended the river about 15 ms. and encamped
on the S. W. side near a few cottonwood trees.
Traveling downstream with ease and unexpected speed, the party pass the mouth of
the Musselshell on August 1, the mouth of the Milk River on the 4th, and, after a day
in which they traveled 83 miles, the Yellowstone on the 7th. The last was the
general rendezvous but, finding no game in the vicinity, Clark had moved
downstream.
[Lewis] THURSDAY AUGUST 7TH 1806.
at 4 P. M. we arrived at the entrance of the Yellowstone river. I landed at the point
and found that Capt. Clark had been encamped at this place and from appearances
had left it about 7 or 8 days. I found a paper on a pole at the point which mearly
contained my name in the hand wrighting of Capt. C. we also found the remnant of a
note which had been attached to a peace of Elk'shorns in the camp; from this
fragment I learned that game was scarce at the point and musquetoes troublesome
which were the

Page 443
reasons given for his going on; I also learnt that he intended halting a few miles
below where he intended waiting my arrival. I now wrote a note directed to Colter
and Collins provided they were behind, ordering them to come on without loss of
time; this note I wraped in leather and attatched to the same pole which Capt. C.
had planted at the point; this being done I instantly reimbarked and decended the
river in the hope of reaching Capt. C's camp before night. about 7 miles below the
point on the S. W. shore I saw some meat that had been lately fleased and hung on
a pole; I directed Sergt. Ordway to go on shore [and] examine the place; on his
return he reported that he saw the tracks of two men which appeared so resent that
he beleived they had been there today, the fire he found at the plce was blaizing and
appeared to have been mended up afresh or within the course of an hour past. he
found at this place a part of a Chinnook hat which my men recognized as the hat of
Gibson; from these circumstances we concluded that Capt. C's camp could not be
distant and pursued our rout untill dark with the hope of reaching his camp in this
however we were disappointed and night coming on compelled us to encamp on the
N. E. shore in the next bottom above our encampment of the 23rd and 24th of April
1805. as we came too a herd of buffaloe assembled on the shore of which we killed a
fat cow.
FRIDAY AUGUST 8TH 1806.
Beleiving from the recent appearances about the fire which we past last evening that
Capt. Clark could be at no great distance below I set out early; the wind heard
[hard] from the N. E. but by the force of the oars and currant we traveled at a good
rate untill 10 A. M. by which time we reached the center of the beaver bends about 8
ms. by water and 3 by land above the entrance of White earth river. not finding Capt.
Clark I knew not what calculation to make with rispect to his halting and therefore
determined to proceed as tho' he was not before me and leave the rest to the
chapter of accedents. at this place I found a good beach for the purpose of drawing
out the perogue and one of the canoes which wanted corking and repairing. the men
with me have not had leasure since we left the West side of the Rocky mountains to
dress any skins or make themselves cloaths and most of them are therefore
extreemly bare. I therefore determined to halt at this place untill

Page 444
the perog[u]e and canoe could be repared and the men dress skins and make
themselves the necessary cloathing. we encamped on the N. E. side of the river; we
found the Musquetoes extreemly troublesome but in this rispect there is but little
choise of camps from hence down to St. Louis. from this place to the little Missouri
there is an abundance of game I shall therefore when I leave this place travel at my
leasure and avail myself of every opportunity to collect and dry meat untill I provide
a sufficient quantity for our voyage not knowing what provision Capt. C. has made in
this rispect. I formed a camp unloaded the canoes and perogue, had the latter and
one of the canoes drawn out to dry, fleased what meat we had collected and hung it
on poles in the sun, after which the men busied themselves in dressing skins and
making themselves cloaths.
Colter and Collins have not caught up with the party when Lewis resumes his
journey on the afternoon of August 10.
MONDAY AUGUST 11TH 1806.
We set out very early this morning. it being my wish to arrive at the birnt hills by
noon in order to take the latitude of that place as it is the most northern point of the
Missouri, I enformed the party of my design and requested that they would exert
themselves to reach the place in time as it would save us the delay of nearly one
day; being as anxious to get forward as I was they plyed their oars faithfully and we
proceeded rapidly. We saw but little game untill about 9 A.M. when we came up with
a buffaloe swiming the river which I shot and killed; leaving the small canoes to
dress it and bring on the meat I proceeded. we had gone but little way before I saw
a very large grizzly bear and put too in order to kill it, but it took wind of us and ran
off. the small canoes overtook us and informed that the flesh of the buffaloe was
unfit for uce and that they had therefor left it. half after 11 A.M. we saw a large herd
of Elk on the N. E. shore and I directed the men in the small canoes to halt and kill
some of them and continued on in the perogue to the birnt hills; when I arrived here
it was about 20 minutes after noon and of course the observation for the meridian
Altitude was lost.
Jus[t] opposite to the birnt hills there happened to be a herd of

Page 445
Elk on a thick willow bar and finding that my observation was lost for the present I
determined to land and kill some of them accordingly we put too and I went out with
Cruzatte only. we fired on the Elk I killed one and he wounded another, we reloaded
our guns and took different routs through the thick willows in pursuit of the Elk; I
was in the act of firing on the Elk a second time when a ball struck my left thye about
an inch below my hip joint, missing the bone it passed through the left thye and cut
the thickness of the bullet across the hinder part of the right thye; the stroke was
very severe; I instantly supposed that Cruzatte had shot me in mistake for an Elk as
I was dressed in brown leather and he cannot see very well; under this impression I
called out to him damn you, you have shot me, and looked towards the place from
whence the ball had come, seeing nothing I called Cruzatte several times as loud as I
could but received no answer; I was now preswaded that it was an indian that had
shot me as the report of the gun did not appear to be more than 40 paces from me
and Cruzatte appeared to be out of hearing of me.
In this situation not knowing how many indians there might be concealed in the
bushes I thought best to make good my retreat to the perogue, calling out as I ran
for the first hundred paces as loud as I could to Cruzatte to retreat that there were
indians hoping to allarm him in time to make his escape also; I still retained the
charge in my gun which I was about to discharge at the moment the ball struck me.
when I arrived in sight of the perogue I called the men to their arms to which they
flew in an instant, I told them that I was wounded but I hoped not mortally, by an
indian I beleived and directed them to follow me that I would return & give them
battle and releive Cruzatte if possible who I feared had fallen into their hands; the
men followed me as they were bid and I returned about a hundred paces when my
wounds became so painfull and my thye so stiff that I could scarcely get on; in short
I was compelled to halt and ordered the men to proceed and if they found
themselves overpowered by numbers to retreat in order keeping up a fire.
I now got back to the perogue as well as I could and prepared myself with a pistol
my rifle and air-gun being determined as a retreat was impracticable to sell my life as
deerly as possible. in this state of anxiety and suspense I remained about 20 minutes
when the party returned with Cruzatte and reported that there

Page 446
were no indians nor the appearance of any; Cruzatte seemed much allarmed and
declared if he had shot me it was not his intention, that he had shot an Elk in the
willows after he left or seperated from me. I asked him whether he did not hear me
when I called to him so frequently which he absolutely denied. I do not beleive that
the fellow did it intentionally but after finding that he had shot me was anxious to
conceal his knowledge of having done so. the ball had lodged in my breeches which I
knew to be the ball of the short rifles such as that he had, and there being no person
out with me but him and no indians that we could discover I have no doubt in my
own mind of his having shot me. with the assistance of Sergt. Gass I took off my
cloaths and dressed my wounds myself as well as I could, introducing tents of patent
lint into the ball holes, the wounds blead considerably but I was hapy to find that it
had touched neither bone nor artery.
I sent the men to dress the two Elk which Cruzatte and myself had killed which they
did in a few minutes and brought the meat to the river. The small canoes came up
shortly after with the flesh of one Elk. my wounds being so situated that I could not
without infinite pain make an observation I determined to relinquish it and proceeded
on. we came within eight miles of our encampment of the 15th of April 1805 and
encamped on N. E. side. as it was painfull to me to be removed I slept on board the
perogue; the pain I experienced excited a high fever and I had a very uncomfortable
night. at 4 P. M. we passed an encampment which had been evacuated this morning
by Capt. Clark, here I found a note from Capt. C. informing me that he had left a
letter for me at the entrance of the Yelow stone river, but that Sergt. Pryor who had
passed that place since he left it had taken the letter; that Sergt. Pryor having been
robed of all his horses had decended the Yelowstone river in skin canoes and had
overtaken him at this encampment. this I fear puts an end to our prospects of
obtaining the Sioux Cheifs to accompany us as we have not now leasure to send and
engage Mr. Heney on this service, or at least he would not have time to engage them
to go as early as it is absolutely necessary we should decend the river.13
13 They had determined to hire Heney to go in search of Sioux chiefs who
would descend the Missouri with them and go on to Washington. The theft of
the horses which Pryor was driving frustrated the plan, since the horses were
to be exchanged for goods which they could give the Sioux for presents. See
below, p. 450.

Page 447
TUESDAY AUGUST 12TH 1806.
Being anxious to overtake Capt. Clark who from the appearance of his camps could
be at no great distance before me, we set out early and proceeded with all possible
expedition at 8 A. M. the bowsman informed me that there was a canoe and a camp
he beleived of whitemen on the N.E. shore. I directed the perogue and canoes to
come too at this place and found it to be the camp of two hunters from the Illinois by
name Joseph Dickson and Forest Hancock.14 these men informed me that Capt. C.
had passed them about noon the day before. they also informed me that they had
left the Illinois in the summer [of] 1804 since which time they had been ascended
the Missouri, hunting and traping beaver; that they had been robed by the indians
and the former wounded last winter by the Tetons of the birnt woods; that they had
hitherto been unsuccessfull in their voyage having as yet caught but little beaver, but
were still determined to proceed. I gave them a short discription of the Missouri, a
list of distances to the most conspicuous streams and remarkable places on the river
above and pointed out to them the places where the beaver most abounded. I also
gave them a file and a couple of pounds of powder and some lead. these were
articles which they assured me they were in great want of. I remained with these
men an hour and a half when I took leave of them and proceeded. while I halted with
these men Colter and Collins who seperated from us on the 3rd i[n]st rejoined us.
they were well no accedent having happened. they informed me that after
proceeding the first day and not overtaking us that they had concluded that we were
behind and had delayed several days in waiting for us and had thus been unable to
join us untill the present mome[n]t. my wounds felt very stiff and soar this morning
but gave me no considerable pain. there was much less inflamation than I had
reason to apprehend there would be. I had last evening applyed a poltice of peruvian
barks.
at 1 P. M. I overtook Capt. Clark and party and had the pleasure of finding them all
well. as wrighting in my present situation is extreemly painfull to me I shall desist
untill I recover and leave to my fri[e]nd Capt. C. the continuation of our journal.
14 These two trappers are not only the first white men whom the expedition
has seen since leaving the Mandan villages in April 1805 they are also the first
to follow the trail which the expedition had blazed.

Chapter XXXI
Clark's Exploration of the Yellowstone
While Lewis was making his strenuous reconnaissance of the Marias, Clark had been
conducting the other exploration which they had decided was necessary, that of the
Yellowstone. His log of this journey, July 3 to August 12, forms Chapter XXXI of the
Journals. Since he was entirely on his own, the daily entries are longer than those
which he customarily wrote and the chapter runs eighty-nine pages. Though it is an
interesting account, nothing of importance happens and the whole chapter is
omitted here. The summary that follows is reprinted from Chapter XII of DeVoto,
The Course of Empire.
Clark's party started up Bitterroot Valley July 3.1 He wanted to find the road to the
Jefferson River which they had heard about while toiling along the Salmon last year.
Shields found it and on July 6 it took them across the Continental Divide by what is
now called Gibbon's Pass. (Not far in miles from the Lost Trail Pass by which they
had crossed from the Salmon to Bitterroot Valley.) It led on down to Big Hole Valley,
where Sacajawea could really be a guide. Holding to her landmarks, on July 8 they
reached the place where they had sunk the dugouts in a pond last August 23. There
was a furious digging to raise the Cache after more than six months of abstinence
they could chew and smoke tobacco again. Clark embarked most of the party in the
boats for the Three Forks, leaving Ordway to take the horses there by land.
Downstream by boat was a different matter from the dreadful upstream tug. They
1 Lewis had left Traveller's Rest for the Hellgate River earlier the same day.

Page 449
made ninety-seven miles the first day and reached the Three Forks on the third.
Here Clark divided his party. Taking eight men, besides Charbonneau, Sacajawea,
and her eighteen-month-old child, he struck overland with the herd of forty-nine
horses, heading for the Yellow-stone. Ordway took the rest of the command down
the Missouri in the boats toward the first rendezvous, the Great Falls. Three days
brought Ordway to the Gate of the Mountains and three more to the head of the
portage, White Bear Island, which he reached on July 19.
Lewis, traveling the direct route from Traveller's Rest, had reached the portage, a
week earlier. He had left there all his party except Drewyer and the two Fields
brothers, putting Sergeant Gass in command. He had also left horses, and with them
to pull last year's truck-frames the job was easy. They raised the caches,
transported the whole outfit across the eighteen-mile portage, and got the white
pirogue into the water. They took eight days, as against more than a month last
year. Lewis was to meet them at the mouth of the Marias, which he was now
exploring, and on July 27 Gass started thither with the horses and Ordway headed
the boats downstream. The next day, well above the mouth of the Marias, they saw
Lewis and his three men who had just reached the Missouri after a hell-for-leather
ride, and fired a swivel to welcome them.
Meanwhile Clark's little party had had an interlude of pure enjoyment, the most
comfortable traveling of the whole expedition. On July 15 he reached the Yellowstone
and saw the majestic mountains through which it flows north from Yellowstone Park.
He could find no timber big enough for dugouts and the river was too swift, he
decided, for the bullboats he had thought of making. So, looking for better timber,
he struck off down the beautiful Yellowstone Valley by pack train. Signal smokes
showed that he was being watched and he thought the watchers must be Crows. He
found some suitable trees and made two dugouts. They were 28 feet long, 16 or 18
inches deep, 16 to 24 inches wide in such craft, axehewn and hollowed by fire, the
great Yellowstone was first navigated by white men. The Crows, honored by all
Plains tribes as the most expert horse-thieves, crawled up one night and got half the
horses, taking them away over hard and gravelly ground so that their trail could not
be followed. The first American horses the Crows ever got.

Page 450
Clark ordered Sergeant Pryor, with three men, to take the rest of the remuda to the
rendezvous at the mouth of the Yellowstone and on to the Mandan villages. (They
were money; they could be traded to the village tribes for corn and skin-cloathing.)
In addition, tying up the expedition's loose ends as he traveled, he gave Pryor a
letter to the Northwester who had most impressed the captains, Hugh Heney. Pryor
was to take it to the posts on the Assiniboine River, as soon as he could get there
from the Mandans. It offered Heney, who had traded with the Teton Sioux, the job of
inducing several Sioux chiefs to accompany Lewis and Clark to Washington, to be
impressed and pacified. Clark offered the going wage and, with a look ahead, the job
of agent for the Sioux at the post which Lewis had advised the government to
establish on the Cheyenne River.
Heney was given, half explicitly, an additional mission: to counteract among his
Sioux clients the influence of the British traders from the Minnesota River. And the
letter had two further purposes. Clark told Heney that the expedition had
accomplished its objective by descending the Columbia to its mouth. He added that
there was now in progress an exploration of a northern affluent of the Missouri which
it had discovered and named the Marias. By this means the North West Company,
and Montreal, would learn at the earliest possible moment that the United States had
reached the Pacific, had nailed down its claim to the Columbia country, and had
investigated its northern boundary.
This was first-rate policy but it did not get started. On Pryor's second night out, the
accomplished Crows managed to steal all the horses he was driving. That left no
currency to buy goods to give to Heney for presents to the Sioux, and the letter was
never delivered. . . . How well these men had mastered the West is demonstrated by
Pryor's action. Unhorsed deep in the wilderness, with his command and commander
outdistancing him farther every day, he was entirely assured. He shot buffalo and
made two Mandan bullboats. Two, not one. One would have comfortably transported
four men and their small outfit, but if it had capsized all the rifles would have been
lost. Pryor embarked his detachment in these novel craft and floated off down the
Yellowstone, soon mastering their use. They floated up to where Clark was waiting
for them on August 8. Pryor reported that bullboats were better for such a river than
dugouts.

Page 451
Clark, however, had taken his party down in his two new dugouts, lashing them
together for greater stability, a trick he had seen used on the middle Missouri. There
were no difficulties and the party lived high on buffalo meat. He ventured to name a
southern affluent Clark's Fork. (Not to be confused with the much bigger Clark's Fork
of the Columbia, the extension of the Blackfoot, Hellgate, and Bitterroot.) It is a
beautiful stream that comes down from the Absaroka Mountains, passing through a
spectacular gorge that is soon to be ruined by a dam. He carved his name on a rock
formation which he named Pompey's Pillar for Sacajawea's child, who traveled in his
dugout and had become ''my boy Pomp.'' He passed and identified the mouth of the
Big Horn on July 6, and repeated the Minnetarees' faulty information that it was very
long and headed with the Platte. (Manuel Lisa was to build his post here a year later
and send Colter, who was now with Clark, to determine whether the Minnetarees
were right.) He passed the Rosebud on July 28, the Tongue on the 29th, and Powder
River, which he seems not to have identified, on the 30th. On August 3, fatly fed,
comfortable, an easy master of the job, he brought the expedition's biggest loop full
circle, reaching the Missouri. They had come to this confluence on the upstream
journey April 26 1805.
He summed up or rather Lewis presently wrote a summary from Clark's notes. It
could be called The Error of the Southwest. The Yellowstone, said the summary, rose
on the border of New Mexico, whence a short, good road led to the Spanish
settlements. (These unseen settlements were always Santa Fe.) Its source was
adjacent to those of the Willamette, the Snake, the Platte, the Bitterroot (!), and the
Big Horn. Pirogues would be the best craft for the Yellowstone but even "batteaux,"
big boats, could go all the way to the mountains. (There must have been a lot of
water in the river that year too.) The Big Horn and Clark's Fork must be navigable for
a considerable distance. (Entirely wrong.) Besides the Big Horn, the mouth of Clark's
Fork would be a good site for a trading post, for it would be fairly safe from the
Blackfeet. This last suggestion seems, temporarily, to undercut the promise to the
Snakes, the Nez Percés, and various Columbia River tribes that the American trade
would seek them out. But only temporarily.
The journal says that the Yellowstone has "a considerable fall" somewhere in the
mountains. This statement has been crossed out and an explicit "No" has been
written after it. Both the statement

Page 452
and the denial are beyond explanation. Clark had talked to no Indians while he was
coming down the river. There had been no mention of the tremendous Yellowstone
Falls in any of the notes made at the villages or among the Snakes.
At the rendezvous mosquitoes were so numerous and buffalo momentarily so scarce
that Clark dropped down the Missouri for some distance, leaving a note on a post for
Pryor and Lewis. On August 11 the two trappers, Dixon and Handcock, the first
followers, rowed their dugouts round the bend and stopped at Clark's camp. Here
was the first news of anything downriver. The peace which the captains had
negotiated at the villages had lasted only a little longer than the echoes of the
orations: the Mandans and the Minnetarees were fighting the Arikaras. Also the
Assiniboins were on the prod: they had killed a Northwester on the Souris, had
vaingloriously forbidden his company to go to the villages (which was just talk), and
had sent out word that they were going to get Charles MacKenzie.
The next day, August 12, Lewis's party came down the Missouri and, yelling, turned
in toward the camp.
Dixon and Handcock came back down the river, having decided to return with the
party to the Mandan villages.

Chapter XXXII
From the Little Missouri to White River
[Clark] WEDNESDAY (FRIDAY) 13TH AUGUST 1806
We Set out at sunrize and proceeded on very well with a Stiff breeze astern the
greater part of the day. passed the Little Missouri river at 8 A. M. and arived at the
Enterance of Myry river at sun set and encamped on the N E Side haveing came by
the assistance of the wind, the current and our oars 86 miles.
THURSDAY (SATURDAY) 14TH AUGUST 1806
Set out at Sunrise and proceeded on. when we were opposit the Minetares Grand
Village we Saw a number of the Nativs viewing of [us] we derected the Blunderbuses
fired Several times, Soon after we Came too at a Croud of the nativs on the bank
opposit the Village of the Shoe Indians or Mah-har-has at which place I saw the
principal Chief of the Little Village of the Menitarre & the principal Chief of the
Mah-har-has. those people were extreamly pleased to See us. the chief of the little
Village of the Menetarras cried Most imoderately, I enquired the cause and was
informed it was for the loss of his Son who had been killed latterly by the Blackfoot
Indians. after a delay of a fiew minits I proceeded on to the black cats Village on the
N.E. side of the Missouri where I intended to Encamp but the Sand blew in Such a
manner that we deturmined not to continue on that side but return to the side we
had left. here we were visited by all the inhabitants of this village who appeared
equally as well pleased to see us

Page 454
as those above. I walked up to the Black Cats village & eate some simnins with him,
and Smoked a pipe this Village I discovered had been rebuilt sin[c]e I left it and
much smaller than it was; enquiring into the cause was informed that a quarrel had
taken place and (a number of) Lodges had removed to the opposd. Side.
I had soon as I landed despatched Shabono to the Minetarras inviting the Chiefs to
visit us, & Drewyer down to the lower Village of the Mandans to ask Mr. Jessomme
to come and enterpret for us. Mr. Jessomme arived and I spoke to the chief of the
Village informing them that we spoke to them as we had done when we were with
them last and we now repeeted our invitation to the principal Chiefs of all the Villages
to accompany us to the U States &c. &c. the Black Cat Chief of the Mandans, spoke
and informed me that he wished to Visit the United States and his Great Father but
was afraid of the Scioux who were yet at war with them and had killed several of
their men since we had left them, and were on the river below and would certainly
kill him if he attempted to go down. I indeavered to do away [with] his objections by
informing him that we would not suffer those indians to hurt any of our red children
who should think proper to accompany us, and on their return they would be equally
protected, and their presents which would be very liberal, with themselves,
conveyed to their own Country at the expence of the U. States &c. &c. the Chief of
the Mah-har-has told me if I would send with him he would let me have some corn. I
directed Sergt Gass & 2 men to accompany him to his Village, they Soon returned
loaded with Corn.
THURSDAY AUGUST 15TH 1806 (continued) MANDANS VILG.
after assembling the Chiefs and Smokeing one pipe, I informed them that I still
Spoke the Same words which we had Spoken to them when we first arived in their
Country in the fall of 1804. we then envited them to visit their great father the
president of the U. States and to hear his own Councils and recieve his gifts from his
own hands as also See the population of a government which can at their pleasure
protect and Secure you from all your enimies, and chastize all those who will shut
their years to his Councils. we now offer to take you at the expense of our
Government and

Page 455
Send you back to your Country again with a considerable present in Merchendize
which you will receive of your great Father.
the Great chief of the Menetaras Spoke, he Said he wished to go down and see his
great father very much, but that the Scioux were in the road and would most
certainly kill him or any others who should go down they were bad people and would
not listen to any thing which was told them. when he Saw us last we told him that
we had made peace with all the nations below, Since that time the Seioux had killed
8 of their people and Stole a number of their horses. he Said that he had opened his
ears and followed our Councils, he had made peace with the Chyennes and rocky
Mountains indians, and repieted the same objecctions as mentioned. if the Sieoux
were at peace with them and could be depended on he as also other Chiefs of the
villages would be glad to go and See their great father, but as they were all afraid of
the Sieoux they should not go down &c.
The Black Cat Chief of the Mandans Village on the North Side of the Missouri sent
over and requested me to go over to his village. after takeing a Smoke he informed
me that as the Scioux were very troublesom and the road to his great father
dangerous none of the village would go down with us. I told the Cheifs and wariers
of the village who were then present that we were anxious that some of the village
Should go and See their great father and hear his good words & receve his bountifull
gifts &c. and told them to pitch on Some Man on which they could rely on and Send
him to see their Great father, they made the same objections which the Chief had
done before. a young man offered to go down, and they all agreed for him to go
down the charactor of this young man I knew as a bad one and made an objection
as to his age and Chareckter at this time Gibson who was with me informed me that
this young man had Stole his knife and had it then in his possession, this I informed
the Chief and directed him to give up the knife he delivered the knife with a very faint
apology for his haveing it in his possession. I then reproached those people for
wishing to send such a man to See and hear the words of so great a man as their
great father, they hung their heads and said nothing for some time when the Chief
spoke and Said that they were afraid to Send any one for fear of their being killed by
the Sieux. being informed by one of our enterpreters that the 2d Chief

Page 456
of the Mandans comonly called the little crow intended to accompany us down, I
took Charbono and walked to the Village to see this Chief and talk with him on the
subject he told me he had deturmined to go down, but wished to have a council first
with his people which would be in the after part of the day.
Colter one of our men expressed a desire to join Some trappers [the two Illinois Men
we met, & who now came down to us] who offered to become shearers with [him]
and furnish traps &c. the offer [was] a very advantagious one, to him, his services
could be dispenced with from this down and as we were disposed to be of service to
any one of our party who had performed their duty as well as Colter had done, we
agreed to allow him the privilage provided no one of the party would ask or expect a
Similar permission to which they all agreed that they wished Colter every suckcess
and that as we did not wish any of them to Seperate untill we Should arive at St.
Louis they would not apply or expect it &c. great number of the nativs of the different
villages came to view us and exchange robes with our men for their Skins we gave
Jo Colter Some Small articles which we did not want and some powder and lead. the
party also gave him several articles which will be usefull to him on his expedittion.
This evening Charbono informed me that our back was scercely turned before a war
party from the two menetarry villages followed on and attacked and killed the Snake
Indians whome we had seen and in the engagement between them and the Snake
indians they had lost two men one of which was the Son of the principal Chief of the
little village of the Menitarras. that they had also went to war from the Menetarras
and killed two Ricaras. he further informed me that a missunderstanding had taken
place between the Mandans & Minetarras and had very nearly come to blows about a
woman, the Menitarres at length presented a pipe and a reconsilliation took place
between them.
FRIDAY 16TH AUGUST 1806
as our swivel could no longer be Serveceable to us as it could not be fireed on board
the largest Perogue, we concluded to make a present of it to the Great Chief of the
Menitaras (the One Eye) with a view to ingratiate him more Strongly in our favour I
had the

Page 457
Swivel Charged and Collected the Chiefs in a circle around it and adressed them with
great ceremoney. told them I had listened with much attention to what the One Eye
had Said yesterday and beleived that he was sincere & Spoke from his heart. I
reproached them very severely for not attending to what had been said to them by
us in council in the fall of 1804 and at different times in the winter of 1804 & 5, and
told them our backs were scercely turned before a party followed and killed the pore
defenceless Snake indians whom we had taken by the hand & told them not to be
afraid that you would never them Strike again &c. also mentioned the ricer[a]s &c.
The little cherry old Chief of the Menetarras spoke as follows Viz: "Father we wish to
go down with you to See our Great Father, but we know the nations below and are
afraid of the Scioux who will be on the river and will kill us on our return home. The
Scioux has Stolen our horses and killed 8 of our men Since you left us, and the
Ricaras have also Struck us. we Staid at home and listened to what you have told us.
we at length went to war against the Scioux and met with Ricaras and killed two of
them, they were on their way to strike us. We will attend to your word and not hurt
any people all Shall be Welcom and we Shall do as you direct." The One Eye said his
ears would always be open to the word of his great father and Shut against bad
council &c I then [with] a good deel of ceremony made a present of the swivel to the
One Eye Chief, and told him when he fired this gun to remember the words of his
great father which we had given him. after the council was over the gun was fired &
delivered, they chief appeared to be much pleased and conveyed it immediately to
his village &c. we Settled with and discharged colter. we Sent for Mr. Jessomme and
told him to use his influence to prevail on one of the Chiefs to accompany us and we
would employ him. he informed us soon after that the big white Chief would go if we
would take his wife & Son & Jessoms wife & 2 children [which] we wer[e] obliged to
agree to do

families
we were visited by all the principal Chiefs of the Menetarras to take their leave of us
at 2 oClock we left our encampment after takeing leave of Colter who also Set out up
the river in company with Messrs. Dickson & Handcock. we also took our leave of T.
Chabono, his Snake Indian wife and their child who had accompanied us on our rout
to the pacific ocean in the capacity of interpreter and interprete[s]s. T. Chabono
wished much to accompany us in the said Capacity if we could have provailed [upon]
the Menetarre Chiefs to dec[e]nd the river with us to the U. States, but as none of
those Chiefs of whoes language he was Conversent would accompany us, his
services were no longer of use to the U. States and he was therefore discharged and
paid up. we offered to convey him down to the Illinois if he chose to go, He declined
proceeding on at present, observing that he had no acquaintance or prospects of
makeing a liveing below, and must continue to live in the way that he had done. I
offered to take his little son a butifull promising child who is 19 months old to which
they both himself & wife wer willing provided the child had been weened. they
observed that in one year the boy would be sufficiently old to leave his mother & he
would then take him to me if I would be so friendly as to raise the child for him in
such a manner as I thought proper, to which I agreed &c.
we droped down to the Big White Chiefs Mandan village 1\2 a mile below on the
South Side, all the Indians proceeded on down by land. and I walked to the lodge of
the Chief whome I found sorounded by his friends the men were Setting in a circle
Smokeing and the womin crying. he Sent his baggage with his wife & son, with the
Interpreter Jessomme & his wife and 2 children to the Canoes provided for them.
after Smokeing one pipe, and distributing some powder & lead which we had given
him, he informed me that he was ready and we were accompd. to the Canoes by all
the village Maney of them Cried out aloud. as I was about to shake with the Grand
Cheifs of all the villages there assembled they requested me to Set one minit longer
with them which I readily agreed to and directed a pipe to be lit. the Cheifs informed
that when we first came to their Country they did not

Page 459
believe all we Said but they were now convinced that every thing we had told them
were true, that they should keep in memory every thing which we had said to them,
and Strictly attend to our advice, that their young men Should Stay at home and
Should no[t] go again to war against any nation, that if any atacted them they
should defend themselves, that we might depend on what they said, and requested
us to inform their great father. the also requested me to tell the Ricaras to come and
see them, not to be afraid that no harm Should be done them, that they were
anxious to be in peace with them.
The Seeoux they said they had no dependance in and Should kill them whenever
they came into their country to do them harm &c. I told them that we had always
told them to defend themselves, but not to strike those nations we had taken by the
hand, the Sieoux with whome they were at war we had never seen on our return we
Should inform their great father of their conduct towards his faithfull red children and
he would take Such Steps as will bring about a lasting peace between them and his
faithfull red children. I informed them that we should inform the ricaras what they
had requested &c. The Grand Chief of the Minetarres said that the Great Cheif who
was going down with [us] to see their great father was a[s] well as if he went also,
and on his return he would be fully informed of the words of his great father, and
requested us to take care of this Gt. Chief. we then saluted them with a gun and set
out and proceeded on to Fort Mandan where I landed and went to view the old works
the houses except one in the rear bastion was burnt by accident, some pickets were
standing in front next to the river.
The mouth of Heart River was passed on August 18.
TUESDAY 19TH OF AUGUST 1806
Capt. Lewis'es wounds are heeling very fast, I am much in hope of his being able to
walk in 8 or 10 days. the wind rose and become very strong from the S.E. and a
great appearance of rain. Jessomme the Interpreter let me have a piece of a lodge
and the Squars pitched or Stretched it over Some Sticks, under this piece of

Page 460
leather I Slept dry, it is the only covering which I have had Sufficient to keep off the
rain Since I left the Columbia. it began to rain moderately soon after night.
WEDNESDAY 20TH OF AUGUST 1806
I observe a great alteration in the Current course and appearance of this pt. of the
Missouri. in places where there was Sand bars in the fall 1804 at this time the main
current passes, and where the current then passed is now a Sand bar. Sand bars
which were then naked are now covered with willow several feet high. the enterance
of some of the Rivers & creeks changed owing to the mud thrown into them, and a
layor of mud over some of the bottoms of 8 inches thick.
[Mouth of Cannonball River passed today.]
THURSDAY 21TE AUGUST 1806
at 8 A.M. Met three frenchmen Comeing up, they proved to be three men from the
Ricaras two of them Reeved & Greinyea wintered with us at the mandans in 1804 we
Came too, those men informed us that they were on their way to the Mandans, and
intended to go down to the Illinois this fall. one of them quit[e] a young lad
requested a passage down to the Illinois, we concented and he got into a Canoe to
[ply] an Ore. Those men informd. us that 700 Seeoux had passed the Ricaras on
their way to war with the Mandans & Menitarras and that their encampment where
the Squaws and children wer, was Some place near the Big Bend of this river below.
they also informed us that no trader had arived at the Ricaras this Season, and that
they were informed that the Pania or Ricara Chief who went to the United States last
Spring was a year, died on his return at Some place near the Sieoux river &c.1 those
men had nether powder nor lead we gave them a horn of powder and some balls and
after a delay of an hour we parted from the[m].
at half past 11 a.m. we arived in view of the upper Ricara villages, a Great number of
womin Collecting wood on the banks, we Saluted the village with four guns and they
returned
1 The Arikara chief died in Washington in April, 1806.

Page 461
the Salute by fireing Several guns in the village, I observed Several very white
Lodges on the hill above the Town which the ricaras from the Shore informed me
were Chyennes who had just arived. we landed opposit to the 2d Village and were
met by the most of the men women and children of each village as also the
Chyennes, they all appeared anxious to take us by the hand and much rejoiced to
See us return. I was Saluted by the two great Chiefs, whome we had made or given
Medals to as we assend[ed] this river in 1804. I Set myself down on the Side of the
Bank and the Chiefs & brave men of the Ricaras & Chyennes formed a cercle around
me. after takeing a Smoke of Mandan tobacco which the Big white Chief who was
seated on my left hand furnished, I informed them as I had before informed the
Mandans & Menitarras where we had been, what we had done and said to the
different nations in there favour and envited Some of their chiefs to accompany us
down and See their great father and receve from his own mouth his good councils
and from his own hands his bountifull gifts &c. telling pretty much the Same which I
had told the mandans and menitarras. told them not to be afraid of any nation below
that none would hurt them &c.
I also told the ricaras that I was very sorrey to here that they were not on friendly
terms with their neighbours the Mandans & Menetarras, and had not listened to what
we had said to them but had Suffered their young men to join the Sieoux who had
killed 8 Mandans &c. that their young men had Stolen the horses of the Minetarras,
in retaliation for those enjories the Mandans & Menetarras had sent out a war party
and killed 2 ricaras. how could they expect other nations would be at peace with
them when they themselves would not listen to what their great father had told
them. I further informed them that the Mandans & Menetaras had opened their ears
to what we had said to them but had Staid at home untill they were Struck that they
were still disposed to be friendly and on good terms with the ricaras, they then Saw
the great chief of the Mandans by my Side who was on his way to see his great
father, and was derected by his nation & the Menetaras & Maharhas, to Smoke in the
pipe of peace with you and to tell you not to be afraid to go to their towns, or take
the Birds in the plains that their ears were open to our councils and no harm Should
be done to a Ricara.

Page 462
The Sun being very hot the Chyenne Chief envited us to his Lodge which was pitched
in the plain at no great distance from the River. I accepted the invitation and
accompanied him to his lodge which was new and much larger than any which I have
Seen it was made of 20 dressed Buffalow Skins in the Same form of the Seeoux and
lodges of other nations of this quarter about this lodges was 20 others several of
them nearly the Same Size. I enquired for the ballance of the nation and was
informed that they were near at hand and would arive on tomorrow and when all
together amounted to 120 Lodges. after Smokeing I gave a medal of the Small size
to the Chyenne Chief &c. which appeared to alarm him, he had a robe and a fleece of
fat Buffalow meat brought and gave me with the meadel back and informed me that
he knew that the white people were all medecine and that he was afraid of the midal
or any thing that white people gave to them. I had previously explained the cause of
my g[i]veing him the medal & flag, and again told him the use of the medal and the
caus[e] of my giveing it to him, and again put it about his neck delivering him up his
preasent of a roab & meat, informing him that this was the medecene which his
Great father directed me to deliver to all the great chiefs who listened to his word
and followed his councils, that he had done so and I should leave the medal with him
as a token of his cincerity &c. he doubled the quantity of meat, and received the
medal
in the evening the Great Chief requested that I would walk to his house which I did,
he gave me about 2 quarts (carrots) of Tobacco, 2 beaver Skins and a trencher of
boiled corn & beans to eat (as it is the custom of all the Nations on the Missouri to
give Something to every white man who enters their lodge something to eat) this
chief informed me that none of his chiefs wished to go down with us they all wished
to see the chief who went down return first, that the Chyennes were a wild people
and were afraid to go. that they Should all listen to what I had said. The interpreter
informed me that the chiefs of those villages had no intention of going down one the
cheifs of the village on the island talked. of going down. I returned to the boat where
I found the principal chief of the lower vilege who had cut part of his hair and
disfigured himself in Such a manner that I did not know him, he informed me the
Seeux had killed his nephew and that [he] Was

Page 463
in tears for him &c. we deturmined to proceed down to the Island and accordingly
took the chief on board and proceeded on down to the Isd. village at which place we
arived a little before dark and were met as before by nearly every individual of the
Village. The one arm 2d Chief of this village whome we had expected to accompany
us down Spoke to the mandan Chief in a loud and thretening tone which caused me
to be Some what alarmed for the Safty of that chief, I inform the Ricaras of this
village that the Mandans had opened their ears to and fold. our councils, that this
chief was on his way to see their Great Father the P. of U S. and was under our
protection that if any enjorey was done to him by any nation that we Should all die to
a man. I at length went to the grand chiefs Lodge by his particular invitation, the
Mandan chief Stuck close to me the Chief had prepd. a Supper of boiled young corn,
beens & [s]quashes of which he gave me in Wooden bowls he also gave me near 2
quarts of the Tobacco (Seed), & informed me he had always had his ears open to
what we had Said, that he was well convinced that the Seeoux was the caus[e] of all
the trouble between the Mandans & them.
FRIDAY 22ND AUGUST 1806
as I was about to leave the chiefs [of the Chyennes] lodge he requested me to Send
Some traders to them, that their country was full of beaver and they would then be
encouraged to kill beaver, but now they had no use for them as they could get
nothing for their skins and did not know well, how to catch beaver. if the white
people would come amongst them they would become acquainted and they [the
white people] would learn them how to take the beaver. I promised the Nation that I
would inform their Great father the President of the U States, and he would have
them Supplied with goods, and mentioned in what manner they would be Supplied
&c. &c.
I am happy to have it in my power to Say that my worthy friend Capt. Lewis is
recovering fast, he walked a little to day for the first time. I have discontinud the tent
in the hole the ball came out
TUESDAY 26TH OF AUGUST 1806
at 8 passed the place the Tetons were encamped at the time they attempted to Stop
us in Sept. 1804, and at 9 A.M. passed the en-

Page 464
terance of Teton River. Saw Several black tail or Mule deer and Sent out to kill them
but they were wild and the humters could not get a Shot at either of them. a fiew
miles below the Teton river I observed a buffalow Skin Canoe lying on the S Shore
and a Short distance lower a raft which induces me to suspect that the Tetons are
not on the Missouri at the big bend as we were informed by the Ricaras, but up the
Teton river. at 5 P.M. we landed a[t] Louisells fort on Ceder Island, this fort is entire
and every part appears to be in the same state it was when we passed it in Sept.
1804 we proceeded on about 10 miles lower and encamped on the S. W. Side. as we
were now in the country where we were informed the Seioux were assembled we
were much on our guard deturmined to put up with no insults from those bands of
Seioux, all the arms &c. in perfect order. Capt. L. is still on the mending hand he
walks a little. we made 60 miles to day with the wind ahead greater part of the day.
SATURDAY 30TH OF AUGUST 1806.
Capt. Lewis is mending Slowly. I took 3 hunters and walked on the N. E. Shore with
a view to kill some fat meet. we had not proceeded far before Saw a large plumb
orchd. of the most delicious plumbs, out of this orchard 2 large Buck Elks ran the
hunters killed them. I stoped the canoes and brought in the flesh which was fat and
fine. here the party collected as many plumbs as they could eate and Several pecks
of which they put by &c. after a delay of nearly 2 hours we again proceeded on
downwards, I saw Several men on horseback which with the help of a spie glass I
found to be Indians on the high hills to the N. E. we landed on the S. W. side and I
sent out two men to a village of Barking Squirels to kill some of those animals 2
imedeatily after landing about 20 indians was discovered on an eminance a little
above us on the opposite Side. one of those men I took to be a french man from his
[having] a blanket capoe & a handkerchief around his head. imediately after 80 or 90
Indian men all armed with fusees & Bows & arrows came out of a wood on the
opposite bank about 1/4 of a mile below us. they fired of[f] their guns as a Salute we
re2 Prairie dogs; Clark wanted to add specimens of them to the expedition's
collection.

Page 465
turned the Salute with 2 rounds. we were at a loss to deturmin of what nation those
indians were. from their hostile appearance we were apprehensive they were Tetons,
but from the country through which they roved we were willing to believe them
either the Yanktons, Pon[c]ars or Mahars either of which nations are well disposed
towards the white people. I deturmined to find out who they were without running
any risque of the party and indians, and therefore took three french men who could
Speak the Mahar Pania and some Seeoux and in a Small canoe I went over to a Sand
bar which extended Sufficiently near the opposite shore to converse.
imedeately after I set out 3 young men set out from the opposite Side and swam
next me on the Sand bar. I derected the men to Speak to them in the Pania and
Mahar Languages first neither of which they could understand I then derected the
man who could speak a fiew words of Seioux to inquire what nation or tribe they
belong to they informed me that they were Tetons and their chief was the black
buffalow this chief I knew very well to be the one we had seen with his band at Teton
river which band had attempted to detain us in the fall of 1804 as we assended this
river and with whome we wer near comeing to blows. I told those Indians that they
had been deef to our councils and ill treated us as we assended this river two years
past, that they had abused all the whites who had visited them since. I believed
them to be bad people & should not suffer them to cross to the Side on which the
party lay, and directed them to return with their band to their camp, that if any of
them come near our camp we Should kill them certainly. I lef[t] them on the bear
[bar] and returned to th[e] party and examined the arms &c those indians seeing
some corn in the canoe requested some of it which I refused being deturmined to
have nothing to do with those people.
Several others swam across one of which understood pania, and as our pania
interpreter was a very good one we had it in our power to inform what we wished. I
told this man to inform his nation that we had not forgot their treatment to us as we
passed up this river &c. that they had treated all the white people who had visited
them very badly; robed them of their goods, and had wounded one man whom I had
Seen. we viewed them as bad people and no more traders would be Suffered to
come to them, and

Page 466
whenever the white people wished to visit the nations above they would come
sufficiently Strong to whip any vilenous party who dare to oppose them and words to
the same purpote. I also told them that I was informed that a part of all their bands
were going to war against the Mandans &c, and that they would be well whiped as
the Mandans & Minitarres &[c] had a plenty of Guns Powder and ball, and we had
given them a cannon to defend themselves. and derected them to return from the
Sand bar and inform their chiefs what we had said to them, and to keep away from
the river or we Should kill every one of them &c. &c. those fellows requested to be
allowed to come across and make cumerads which we positively refused and I
directed them to return imediately which they did and after they had informed the
Chiefs &c. as I suppose what we had said to them, they all set out on their return to
their camps back of a high hill. 7 of them halted on the top of the hill and
blackguarded us, told us to come across and they would kill us all &c of which we
took no notice.
we all this time were extreamly anxious for the arival of the 2 fields & Shannon
whome we had left behind, and were some what consd. as to their Safty. to our
great joy those men hove in Sight at 6 P. M. Jo Fields had killed 3 black tail or mule
deer. we then Set out, as I wished to see what those Indians on the hill would act,
we steared across near the opposit Shore, this notion put them [in] some agitation
as to our intentions, some set out on the direction towards their Camps others
walked about on the top of the hill and one man walked down the hill to meet us and
invited us to land to which invitation I paid no kind of attention. this man I knew to
be the one who had in the fall 1804 accompanied us 2 days and is said to be the
friend to the white people. after we passed him he returned on the top of the hill and
gave 3 strokes with the gun (on the earth this is swearing by the earth) he had in his
hand this I am informed is a great oath among the indians.

Chapter XXXIII
The Home Stretch
[Clark] MONDAY 1ST OF SEPTEMBER 1806
At 9 A. M. we passed the enterance of River Quiequur [the Niobrara] which had the
Same appearance it had when we passed up water rapid and of a milky white colour
about two miles below the Quicurre, 9 Indians ran down the bank and beckened to
us to land, they appeared to be a war party, and I took them to be Tetons and paid
no kind of attention to them further than an enquirey to what tribe they belonged,
they did not give me any answer, I prosume they did not understand the man who
Spoke to them as he Spoke but little of their language. as one canoe was yet behind
we landed in an open commanding Situation out of sight of the indians deturmined to
delay untill they came up. about 15 minits after we had landed Several guns were
fired by the indians, which we expected was at the three men behind. I calld out 15
men and ran up with a full deturmination to cover them if possible let the number of
the indians be what they might. Capt. Lewis hobled up on the bank and formed the
remainder of the party in a Situation well calculated to defend themselves and the
Canoes &c.
when I had proceeded to the point about 250 yards I discovered the Canoe about 1
mile above & the indians where we had left them. I then walked on the Sand beech
and the indians came down to meet me I gave them my hand and enquired of them
what they were Shooting at, they informed me that they were Shooting off their guns
at an old Keg which we had thrown out of one of the Canoes and was floating down.
those indians informed me they

Page 468
were Yanktons, one of the men with me knew one of the Indians to be the brother of
young Durion's wife. finding those indians to be Yanktons I invited them down to the
boats to Smoke. when we arived at the Canoes they all eagerly Saluted the Mandan
Chief, and we all set and smoked Several pipes. I told them that we took them to be
a party of Tetons and the fireing I expected was at the three men in the rear Canoe
and I had went up with a full intention to kill them all if they had been tetons & fired
on the canoe as we first expected, but finding them Yanktons and good men we
were glad to see them and take them by the hand as faithfull Children who had
opened their ears to our Councils. one of them Spoke and Said that their nation had
opened their years & done as we had directed them ever since we gave the Meadel
to their great Chief, and should continue to do as we had told them
we enquired if any of their chiefs had gone down with Mr. Durion, the[y] answered
that their great Chief and many of their brave men had gone down, that the white
people had built a house near the Mahar village where they traded. we tied a piece of
ribon to each mans hair and gave them some corn of which they appeared much
pleased. The Mandan chief gave a par of elegant Legins to the principal man of the
indian party, which is an indian fashion (to make presents) the Canoe & 3 men
haveing joined us we took our leave of this party telling them to return to their band
and listen to our councils which we had before given to them. Their band of 80
Lodges were on plum creek a fiew miles to the north. after we all came together we
again proceeded on down to a large Sand bar imediately opposit to the place where
we met the Yanktons in council at the Calumet Bluffs and which place we left on the
1st of Sepr. 1804. I observed our old flag Staff or pole Standing as we left it.
WEDNESDAY 3RD SEPTEMBER 1806
passed the enterance of redstone River on the N. E. Side at 11 A M. and at half past
4 P. M we Spied two boats & Several men, our party p[l]eyed their ores and we soon
landed on the Side of the Boats the men of [these] boats Saluted us with their Small
arms I landed & was met by a Mr. James Airs [Aird] from the Mackanaw by way of
Prarie Dechien and St. Louis. this Gentleman is of the house of Dickson & Co. of
Prarie de Chian who has

Page 469
a Licence to trade for one year with the Sieoux he has 2 Batteaux loaded with
Merchendize for that purpose. This Gentleman receved both Capt. Lewis and my self
with every mark of friendship he was himself at the time with a chill of the agu on
him which he has had for Several days. our first enquirey was after the President of
our country and then our friends and the State of the politicks of our country &c. and
the State [of] Indian affairs to all of which enquireys Mr. Aires gave us a Satisfactory
information as he had it in his power to have collected in the Illinois which was not a
great deel. soon after we Landed a violent Storm of Thunder Lightning and rain from
the N. W. which was violent with hard claps of thunder and Sharp Lightning which
continued untill 10 P M after which the wind blew hard. I set up late and partook of
the tent of Mr. Aires which was dry.
Mr. Aires unfortunately had his boat Sunk on the 25 of July last by a violent storm of
Wind and hail by which accident he lost the most of his usefull articles as he
informed us. this Gentleman informed us of maney changes & misfortunes which had
taken place in the Illinois amongst others the loss of Mr. Cady [Pierre] Choteaus
house and furniture by fire. for this misfortune of our friend Choteaus I feel my self
very much concernd &c. he also informed us that Genl. Wilkinson was the governor
of the Louisiana and at St. Louis. 300 of the american Troops had been cantuned on
the Missouri a fiew miles above it's mouth, Some disturbance with the Spaniards in
the Nackatosh [Natchitoches] Country is the cause of their being called down to that
country, the Spaniards had taken one of the U. States frigates in the Mediteranean,
Two British Ships of the line had fired on an American Ship in the port of New York,
and killed the Capts. brother. 2 Indians had been hung in St. Louis for murder and
several others in jale. and that Mr. Burr & Gel Hambleton fought a Duel, the latter
was killed &c. &c. I am happy to find that my worthy friend Capt. L's is so well as to
walk about with ease to himself &c. we made 60 Miles to day the river much crowded
with Sand bars, which are very differently Situated from what they were when we
went up.
THURSDAY 4TH SEPTEMBER 1806.
as we were in want of some tobacco I purposed to Mr. Airs to furnish us with 4
carrots for which we would Pay the amount to

Page 470
any Merchant of St. Louis he very readily agreed to furnish us with tobacco and gave
to each man as much as it is necessary for them to use between this and St. Louis,
an instance of Generossity for which every man of the party appears to
acknowledge. Mr. Airs also insisted on our accepting a barrel of flour. we gave to this
gentleman what corn we could Spear amounting to about 6 bushels, this corn was
well calculated for his purpose as he was about to make his establishment and would
have it in his power to hull the corn &c. the flower was very acceptable to us we
have yet a little flour part of what we carried up from the Illinois as high as Maria's
river and buried it there untill our return &c.
at 8 A. M. we took our leave and Set out, and proceeded on very well, at 11 A. M.
passed the Enterance of the big Sieoux River which is low, and at meridian we came
too at Floyds Bluff below the Enterance of Floyds river and assended the hill, with
Capt. Lewis and Several men, found the grave had been opened by the nativs and
left half covered. we had this grave completely filled up, and returned to the canoes
and proceeded on to the Sand bar on which we encamped from the 12th to the 20th
of August 1804 near the Mahar Village, here we came to and derected every wet
article put out to dry, all the bedding of the party and Skins being wet. as it was late
in the evening we deturmined to continue all night. had issued to each man of the
party a cup of flour. a little before night Several Guns were heard below and in a
direction towards the Mahar village which induced us to suspect that Mr. McClellin
who we was informed was on his way up to trade with the Mahars had arived at the
Creek below and that those reports of Guns was some of his party out hunting.
FRIDAY 5TH SEPTEMBER 1806
the report of the guns which was heard must have been the Mahars who most
probably have just arrived at their village from hunting the buffalow. this is a season
they usialy return to their village to secure their crops of corn Beens punkins &c &c.
proceeded on very well passed the blue Stone bluff at 3 P. M.
SATURDAY 6TH SEPTEMBER 1806.
at the lower point of Pelecan Island a little above the Petite River de Seeoux we met a
tradeing boat of Mr. Og. Choteaux [Auguste Chouteau] of St. Louis bound to the
River Jacque to

Page 471
trade with the Yanktons, this boat was in care of a Mr. Henry Delorn, he had exposed
all his loading (to dry) and sent out five of his hands to hunt they soon arived with an
Elk. we purchased a gallon of whiskey of this man (promised to pay Choteau who
would not receive any pay) and gave to each man of the party a dram which is the
first spiritious licquor which had been tasted by any of them since the 4 of July 1805.
several of the party exchanged leather for linen Shirts and beaver for corse hats.
Those men could inform us nothing more than that all the troops had movd. from the
Illinois and that Genl. Wilkinson was prepareing to leave St. Louis. We advised this
trader to treat the Tetons with as much contempt as possible and stated to him
where he would be benefited by such treatment &c &c. and at 1 P. M. set out those
men gave us 2 Shots from a Swivell they had on the bow of their boat which we
returned in our turn. The Chief & the Squaws & children are awarey of their journey.
Children cry &c.
TUESDAY 9TH SEPTEMBER 1806
passed the enterance of the great river Platt which is at this time low the water
nearly clear the current turbelant as usial; the Sand bars which choked up the
Missouri and confined the [river] to a narrow Snagey Chanel are wastd. a way and
nothing remains but a fiew Small remains of the bear [bar] which is covered with
drift wood. below the R. Platt the current of the Missouri becomes evidently more
rapid than above and the Snags much more noumerous and bad to pass late in the
evening we arived at the Bald pated prarie and encamped imediately opposit our
encampment of the 16th and 17th of July 1804. our party appears extreamly anxious
to get on, and every day appears [to] produce new anxieties in them to get to their
country and friends. My worthy friend Cap Lewis has entirely recovered his wounds
are heeled up and he can walk and even run nearly as well as ever he could, the
parts are yet tender &c &c. the climate is every day preceptably wormer and air more
Sultery than I have experienced for a long time. the nights are now so worm that I
sleep comfortable under a thin blanket, a fiew days past 2 was not more than
sufficient
WEDNESDAY 10TH SEPTEMBER 1806.
at [blank in MS] P M we met a Mr. Alexander La fass and three french men from St.
Louis in a Small perogue on his way to the

Page 472
River Platt to trade with the Pania Luup or Wolf Indians. this man was extreemly
friendly to us he offered us any thing he had, we axcepted of a bottle of whisky only
which we gave to our party, Mr. la frost informed us that Genl. Wilkinson and all the
troops had decended the Mississippi and Mr. Pike1 and young Mr. Wilkinson had Set
out on an expedition up the Arkansaw river or in that direction after a delay of half an
hour we proceedd on about 3 miles and met a large perogue and 7 Men from St.
Louis bound to the Mahars for the purpose of trade, this perogue was in Charge of a
Mr. La Craw (Croix) we made Some fiew enquiries of this man and again proceeded
on through a very bad part of the river crouded with Snags & Sawyers and incamped
on a Sand bar about 4 miles above the Grand Nemahar. we find the river in this
timbered country narrow and more moveing Sands and a much greater quantity of
Sawyers or Snags than above. Great caution and much attention is required to Stear
clear of all those dificuelties in this low State of the water.
FRIDAY 12TH OF SEPTEMBER 1806
we Set out at Sunrise the usial hour and proceeded on very well about 7 miles met 2
perogues from St. Louis one contained the property of Mr. Choteau bound to the
panias or River Platt, the other going up trapping as high as the Mahars. here we met
one of the french men who had accompanied us as high as the Mandans he informed
us that Mr. McClellan was a fiew miles below the wind blew a head soon after we
passed those perogues, we Saw a man on Shore who informed us that he was one
of Mr. McClellins party and that he was a Short distance below, we took this man on
board and proceeded on and Met Mr. McClellin2 at the St. Michls. Prarie we came too
here we found Mr. Jo Gravelin the Ricaras enterpreter whome we had Sent down
with a Ricaras Chief in the Spring of 1805. and old M. Durion the Sieux enterpreter,
we examined the instructions of those interpreters and found that Gravelin was
ordered to the Ricaras with a Speach from the president of the U. States to that
nation and some presents which had been given the Ricara Chief who had visited the
U. States and unfortunately died at the City
1 Zebulon Pike.
2 Robert McClelan. Clark had served with him under Wayne.

Page 473
of Washington, he was instructed to teach the Ricaras agriculture & make every
enquirey after Capt. Lewis my self and the party. Mr. Durion was enstructed to
accompany Gravelin and through his influence pass him with his presents &[c.] by
the tetons bands of Sieux, and to provale on Some of the Principal chiefs of those
bands not exceeding six to Visit the Seat of the Government next Spring. he was also
enstructed to make every enquirey after us. We made Some Small addition to his
instructions by extending the number of Chiefs to 10 or 12 or 3 from each band
including the Yanktons &c. Mr. McClellin receved us very politely, and gave us all the
news and occurrences which had taken place in the Illinois within his knowledge the
evening proveing to be wet and cloudy we concluded to continue all night,
SATURDAY 13TH SEPTEMBER 1806
rose early Mr. McClellen gave each man a Dram and a little after Sunrise we Set out
we landed at the Camp of the 5 hunters whome we had Sent a head, they had killed
nothing, the wind being too high for us to proceed in Safty through the eme[n]city of
Snags which was imediately below we concluded to lye by and Sent on the Small
canoes a Short distance to hunt and kill Some meat, I felt my self very unwell and
derected a little Chocolate which Mr. McClellin gave us, prepared of which I drank
about a pint and found great relief.
SUNDAY 14TH SEPTR 1806
at 2 P. M. a little below the lower [end] of the old Kanzas Village we met three large
boats bound to the Yanktons and Mahars the property of Mr. Lacroy, Mr. Aiten & Mr.
Coutau all from St. Louis, those young men received us with great friendship and
pressed on us Some whisky for our men, Bisquet, Pork and Onions, & part of their
Stores, we continued near 2 hours with those boats, makeing every enquirey into
the state of our friends and country &c. those men were much affraid of meeting
with the Kanzas. we proceeded on to an Island near the middle of the river below
our encampment of the 1st of July 1804 and encamped haveing decended only 53
miles to day. our party received a dram and Sung Songs untill 11 oClock at night in
the greatest harmoney.

Page 474
TUESDAY 16TH SEPTEMBER 1806
the Day proved excessively worm and disagreeable, so much so that the men rowed
but little, at 10 A. M. we met a large tradeing perogue bound for the Panias we
continued but a Short time with them. at 11 A. M. we met young Mr. Bobidoux
[Robidoux] with a large boat of six ores and 2 canoes, the licenes of this young man
was to trade with the Panias Mahars and ottoes reather an extroardanary a license
for [so] young a man and without the Seal of the teritory anexed, as Genl.
Wilkinsons Signeture was not to this instrement we were somewhat doubtfull of it.
Mr. Browns Signiture we were not acquainted with without the Teritorial Seal. we
made Some enquireys of this young man and cautioned him against prosueing the
Steps of his brother in attempting to degrade the American Charector in the eyes of
the Indians.
WEDNESDAY 17TH SEPTEMBER 1806
at 11 A. M. we met a Captain McClellin3 late a Capt. of Artily. of the U States Army
assending in a large boat. this gentleman an acquaintance of my friend Capt. Lewis
was Somewhat astonished to see us return and appeared rejoiced to meet us. we
found him a man of information and from whome we received a partial account of
the political State of our country, we were makeing enquires and exchangeing
answers &c. untill near mid night. this Gentleman informed us that we had been long
Since given out [up] by the people of the U S Generaly and almost forgotten, the
President of the U. States had yet hopes of us; we received some civilities of Capt.
McClellin, he gave us Some Buisquit, Chocolate Sugar & whiskey, for which our party
were in want and for which we made a return of a barrel of corn & much obliged to
him.
Capt. McClellin informed us that he was on reather a speculative expedition to the
confines of New Spain, with the view to entroduce a trade with those people. his plan
is to proceede up this river to the Enterance of the river platt there to form an
establishment from which to trade partially with the Panas & Ottoes, to form an
acquaintance with the Panias and provail [on] Some of their principal Chiefs to
accompany him to Santa Fee where he will appear in a stile calculated to atract the
Spanish
3 John McClallan.

Page 475
government in that quarter and through the influence of a handsome present he
expects to be promited to exchange his merchindize for Silver & gold of which those
people abound. he has a kind of introductory Speach from Govr. Wilkinson to the
Panias and Ottoes and a quantity of presents of his own which he purposes
distributing to the Panias and ELeatans4 with a view to gain their protection in the
execution of his plans, if the Spanish Governmt. favour his plans, he purposes
takeing his merchendize on mules & horses which can easily be procured of the
panias, to some point convenient to the Spanish Settlements within the Louisiana
Teritory to which place the inhabitants of New mexico may meet him for the purpose
of trade &c. Capt. McClellins plan I think a very good one if strictly prosued &c.
THURSDAY 18TH OF SEPTEMBER 1806
our party entirely out of provisions subsisting on poppaws. we divide[d] the buiskit
which amounted to nearly one buisket per man, this in addition to the poppaws is to
last us down to the Settlement's which is 150 miles the party appear perfectly
contented and tell us that they can live very well on the pappaws. we made 52 miles
to day only. one of our party J. Potts complains very much of one of his eyes which
is burnt by the Sun from exposeing his face without a cover from the Sun. Shannon
also complains of his face & eyes &c.
FRIDAY 19TH OF SEPTR. 1806
we arived at the Enterance of Osage River at dark and encamped on the Spot we had
encamped on the 1st & 2nd of June 1804 haveing came 72 miles. a very singular
disorder is takeing place amongst our party that of the Sore eyes. three of the party
have their eyes inflamed and Sweled in Such a manner as to render them extreamly
painfull, particularly when exposed to the light, the eye ball is much inflaimed and the
lid appears burnt with the Sun, the cause of this complaint of the eye I can't
[account] for. from it's sudden appearance I am willing to believe it may be owing to
the reflection of the sun on the water.
4 Ietans: properly the Utes but here probably intended to designate the
Comanches, who were known to roam along the route to Sante Fe.

Page 476
SATURDAY 20TH SEPTR. 1806
as three of the party was unabled to row from the State of their eyes we found it
necessary to leave one of our crafts and divide the men into the other Canoes, we
left the two Canoes lashed together which I had made high up the River Rochejhone,
those Canoes we Set a drift and a little after day light we Set out and proceeded on
very well. at meridian we passed the enterance of the Gasconnade river below which
we met a perogue with 5 french men bound to the Osarge Gd. village. the party
being extreemly anxious to get down ply their ores very well, we saw some cows on
the bank which was a joyfull Sight to the party and caused a Shout to be raised for
joy at [blank in MS.] P. M we came in Sight of the little french Village called Charriton
[La Charette] the men raised a Shout and Sprung upon their ores and we soon
landed opposit to the Village. our party requested to be permited to fire off their
Guns which was alowed & they discharged 3 rounds with a harty cheer, which was
returned from five tradeing boats which lay opposit the village. we landed and were
very politely received by two young Scotch men from Canada one in the employ of
Mr. Aird a Mr. [blank space in MS]. and the other Mr. Reed, all of those boats were
bound to the Osage and Ottoes. those two young Scotch gentlemen furnished us
with Beef flower and some pork for our men, and gave us a very agreeable supper.
as it was like to rain we accepted of a bed in one of their tents. we purchased of a
citizen two gallons of Whiskey for our party for which we were obliged to give Eight
dollars in Cash, an imposition on the part of the citizen. every person, both French
and americans seem to express great pleasure at our return, and acknowledged
themselves much astonished in seeing us return. they informed us that we were
supposed to have been lost long since, and were entirely given out by every person
&c.
Those boats are from Canada in the batteaux form and wide in perpotion to their
length. their length about 30 feet and the width 8 feet & pointed bow and stern, flat
bottom and rowing six ores only the Skenackeity form. those Bottoms are prepared
for the navigation of this river, I beleive them to be the best calculated for the
navigation of this river of any which I have Seen. they are wide and flat not Subject
to the dangers of the roleing Sands, which larger boats are on this river. the
American inhabitants express

Page 477
great disgust for the governmt. of this Teritory. from what I can lern it arises from a
disapmt. of getting all the Spanish Grants Confirmed.
SUNDAY 21ST SEPTR. 1806
rose early this morning colected our men several of them had axcepted of the
invitation of the citizens and visited their families. at half after 7 A. M we Set out.
passed 12 canoes of Kickapoos assending on a hunting expedition. Saw Several
persons also stock of different kind on the bank which reviv'd the party very much.
at 3 P M we met two large boats assending. at 4 P M we arived in Sight of St.
Charles, the party rejoiced at the Sight of this hospita[b]l[e] village plyed thear ores
with great dexterity and we Soon arived opposit the Town this day being Sunday we
observed a number of Gentlemen and ladies walking on the bank, we saluted the
Village by three rounds from our blunderbuts and the Small arms of the party, and
landed near the lower part of the town. we were met by great numbers of the
inhabitants, we found them excessively polite. we received invitations from Several
of those Gentlemen Mr. Querie under took to Supply our party with provisions &c.
the inhabitants of this village appear much delighted at our return and seem to vie
with each other in their politeness to us all. we came only 48 miles to day. the banks
of the river thinly settled &c. (some Settlements since we went up)
MONDAY 22ND OF SEPTR. 1806
This morning being very wet and the rain Still continueing hard, and our party being
all sheltered in the houses of those hospitable people, we did not [think] proper to
proceed on untill after the rain was over, and continued at the house of Mr. Proulx. I
took this oppertunity of writeing to my friends in Kentucky &c. at 10 A M. it seased
raining and we colected our party and Set out and proceeded on down to the
Contonemt. at Coldwater Creek about 3 miles up the Missouri on it's Southern
banks, at this place we found Colo. Hunt & a Lieut. Peters & one Company of
Artillerists we were kindly received by the Gentlemen of this place. Mrs. Wilkinson
the Lady of the Govr. & Genl. we wer sorry to find in delicate health.

Page 478
we were honored with a Salute of [blank space in MS.] Guns and a harty welcom. at
this place there is a publick store kept in which I am informed the U. S have 60000$
worth of indian Goods
TUESDAY 23RD SEPTR. 1806
we rose early took the Chief to the publick store & furnished him with Some clothes
&c. took an early breckfast with Colo. Hunt and Set out decended to the Mississippi
and down that river to St. Louis at which place we arived about 12 oClock. we
Suffered the party to fire off their pieces as a Salute to the Town. we were met by all
the village and received a harty welcom from it's inhabitants &c. here I found my old
acquaintance Majr. W. Christy who had settled in this town in a public line as a
Tavern Keeper. he furnished us with store rooms for our baggage and we accepted
of the invitation of Mr. Peter Choteau and took a room in his house. we payed a
friendly visit to Mr. August Chotau and some of our old friends this evening. as the
post had departed from St. Louis Capt. Lewis wrote a note to Mr. Hay in Kahoka
[Cahokia] to detain the post at that place untill 12 tomorrow which was reather later
than his usial time of leaveing it
WEDNESDAY 24TH OF SEPTEMBER 1806
I sleped but little last night however we rose early and commenc[e]d wrighting our
letters Capt Lewis wrote one to the presidend and I wrote Govr. Harrison & my
friends in Kentucky and Sent of[f] George Drewyer with those letters to Kohoka &
delivered them to Mr. Hays &c. we dined with Mr. Chotoux to day, and after dinner

Appendix I
Jefferson's Instructions to Lewis
To Meriwether Lewis, esquire, Captain of the 1st regiment of infantry of the United
States of America: Your situation as Secretary of the President of the United States
has made you acquainted with the objects of my confidential message of Jan. 18,
1803, to the legislature. you have seen the act they passed, which, tho' expressed in
general terms, was meant to sanction those objects, and you are appointed to carry
them into execution.
Instruments for ascertaining by celestial observations the geography of the country
thro' which you will pass, have already been provided. light articles for barter, &
presents among the Indians, arms for your attendants, say for from 10 to 12 men,
boats, tents, & other travelling apparatus, with ammunition, medicine, surgical
instruments & provisions you will have prepared with such aids as the Secretary at
War can yield in hs department; & from him also you will recieve authority to engage
among our troops, by voluntary agreement, the number of attendants above
mentioned, over whom you, as their commanding officer are invested with all the
powers the laws give in such a case.
As your movements while within the limits of the U. S. will be better directed by
occasional communications, adapted to circumstances as they arise, they will not be
noticed here. what follows will respect your proceedings after your departure from
the U. S.
Your mission has been communicated to the Ministers here from France, Spain &
Great Britain, and through them to their governments: and such assurances given
them as to it's objects as we trust will satisfy them. the country of Louisiana having
been ceded by Spain to France, the passport you have from the Minister of France,

Page 482
the representative of the present sovereign of the country, will be a protection with
all it's subjects: And that from the Minister of England will entitle you to the friendly
aid of any traders of that allegiance with whom you may happen to meet.
The object of your mission is to explore the Missouri river, & such principal stream of
it, as, by it's course & communication with the waters of the Pacific Ocean, may offer
the most direct & practicable water communication across this continent, for the
purposes of commerce.
Beginning at the mouth of the Missouri, you will take observations of latitude &
longitude, at all remarkable points on the river, & especially at the mouths of rivers,
at rapids, at islands & other places & objects distinguished by such natural marks &
characters of a durable kind, as that they may with certainty be recognized
hereafter. the courses of the river between these points of observation may be
supplied by the compass, the log-line & by time, corrected by the observations
themselves. the variations of the compass too, in different places, should be noticed.
The interesting points of portage between the heads of the Missouri & the water
offering the best communication with the Pacific Ocean should also be fixed by
observation, & the course of that water to the ocean, in the same manner as that of
the Missouri.
Your observations are to be taken with great pains & accuracy, to be entered
distinctly, & intelligibly for others as well as yourself, to comprehend all the elements
necessary, with the aid of the usual tables, to fix the latitude and longitude of the
places at which they were taken, & are to be rendered to the war office, for the
purpose of having the calculations made concurrently by proper persons within the
U. S. several copies of these, as well as your other notes, should be made at leisure
times & put into the care of the most trustworthy of your attendants, to guard by
multiplying them, against the accidental losses to which they will be exposed. a
further guard would be that one of these copies be written on the paper of the birch,
as less liable to injury from damp than common paper.
The commerce which may be carried on with the people inhabiting the line you will
pursue, renders a knolege of these people important. you will therefore endeavor to
make yourself acquainted, as far as a diligent pursuit of your journey shall admit,

Page 483
with the names of the nations & their numbers;
the extent & limits of their possessions;
their relations with other tribes or nations;
their language, traditions, monuments;
their ordinary occupations in agriculture, fishing, hunting, war, arts, & the
implements for these;
their food, clothing, & domestic accomodations;
the diseases prevalent among them, & the remedies they use;
moral & physical circumstances which distinguish them from the tribes we know;
peculiarities in their laws, customs & dispositions;
and articles of commerce they may need or furnish, & to what extent.
And considering the interest which every nation has in extending & strengthening the
authority of reason & justice among the people around them, it will be useful to
acquire what knolege you can of the state of morality, religion & information among
them, as it may better enable those who endeavor to civilize & instruct them, to
adapt their measures to the existing notions & practises of those on whom they are
to operate.
Other object worthy of notice will be
the soil & face of the country, it's growth & vegetable productions; especially
those not of the U.S.
the animals of the country generally, & especially those not known in the U. S.
the remains and accounts of any which may deemed rare or extinct;
the mineral productions of every kind; but more particularly metals, limestone, pit
coal & salpetre; salines & mineral waters, noting the temperature of the last, &
such circumstances as may indicate their character.
Volcanic appearances.
climate as characterized by the thermometer, by the proportion of rainy, cloudy &
clear days, by lightening, hail, snow, ice, by the access & recess of frost, by the

Page 484
winds prevailing at different seasons, the dates at which particular plants put
forth or lose their flowers, or leaf, times of appearance of particular birds,
reptiles or insects.
Altho' your route will be along the channel of the Missouri, yet you will endeavor to
inform yourself, by inquiry, of the character & extent of the country watered by it's
branches, & especially on it's southern side. the North river or Rio Bravo which runs
into the gulph of Mexico, and the North river, or Rio colorado, which runs into the
gulph of California, are understood to be the principal streams heading opposite to
the waters of the Missouri, and running Southwardly. whether the dividing grounds
between the Missouri & them are mountains or flatlands, what are their distance
from the Missouri, the character of the intermediate country, & the people inhabiting
it, are worthy of particular enquiry. The Northern waters of the Missouri are less to
be enquired after, because they have been ascertained to a considerable degree, and
are still in a course of ascertainment by English traders & travellers. but if you can
learn anything certain of the most Northern source of the Missisipi, & of it's position
relative to the lake of the woods, it will be interesting to us. some account too of the
path of the Canadian traders from the Missisipi, at the mouth of the Ouisconsin river,
to where it strikes the Missouri and of the soil & rivers in it's course, is desireable.
In all your intercourse with the natives treat them in the most friendly & conciliatory
manner which their own conduct will admit; allay all jealousies as to the object of
your journey, satisfy them of it's innocence, make them acquainted with the
position, extent, character, peaceable & commercial dispositions of the U. S. of our
wish to be neighborly, friendly & useful to them, & of our dispositions to a
commercial intercourse with them; confer with them on the points most convenient
as mutual emporiums, & the articles of most desireable interchange for them & us. if
a few of their influential chiefs, within practicable distance, wish to visit us, arrange
such a visit with them, and furnish them with authority to call on our officers, on
their entering the U. S. to have them conveyed to this place at public expence. if any
of them should wish to have some of their young people brought up with us, &
taught such arts as may be useful to

Page 485
them, we will receive, instruct & take care of them. such a mission, whether of
influential chiefs, or of young people, would give some security to your own party.
carry with you some matter of the kine-pox, inform those of them with whom you
may be of it' efficacy as a preservative from the small-pox; and instruct & incourage
them in the use of it. this may be especially done wherever you winter.
As it is impossible for us to foresee in what manner you will be recieved by those
people, whether with hospitality or hostility, so is it impossible to prescribe the exact
degree of perseverance with which you are to pursue your journey. we value too
much the lives of citizens to offer them to probably destruction. your numbers will be
sufficient to secure you against the unauthorised opposition of individuals, or of
small parties: but if a superior force, authorised or not authorised, by a nation,
should be arrayed against your further passage, & inflexibly determined to arrest it,
you must decline it's further pursuit, and return. in the loss of yourselves, we should
lose also the information you will have acquired. by returning safely with that, you
may enable us to renew the essay with better calculated means. to your own
discretion therefore must be left the degree of danger you may risk, & the point at
which you should decline, only saying we wish you to err on the side of your safety,
& bring back your party safe, even if it be with less information.
As far up the Missouri as the white settlements extend, an intercourse will probably
be found to exist between them and the Spanish posts at St. Louis, opposite
Cahokia, or Ste. Genevieve opposite Kaskaskia. from still farther up the river, the
traders may furnish a conveyance for letters. beyond that you may perhaps be able
to engage Indians to bring letters for the government to Cahokia or Kaskaskia, on
promising that they shall there receive such special compensation as you shall have
stipulated with them. avail yourself of these means to communicate to us, at
seasonable intervals, a copy of your journal, notes & observations of every kind,
putting into cypher whatever might do injury if betrayed.
Should you reach the Pacific ocean [One full line scratched out, indecipherable.
Thwaites.] inform yourself of the circumstances which may decide whether the furs
of those parts may not be collected as advantageously at the head of the Missouri
(convenient as is supposed to the waters of the Colorado & Oregon or Columbia) as
at Nootka sound or any other point of that coast; & that trade be

Page 486
consequently conducted through the Missouri & U. S. more beneficially than by the
circumnavigation now practised.
On your arrival on that coast endeavor to learn if there be any port within your reach
frequented by the sea-vessels of any nation, and to send two of your trusty people
back by sea, in such way as shall appear practicable, with a copy of your notes. and
should you be of opinion that the return of your party by the way they went will be
eminently dangerous, then ship the whole, & return by sea by way of Cape Horn or
the Cape of good Hope, as you shall be able. as you will be without money, clothes
or provisions, you must endeavor to use the credit of the U. S. to obtain them; for
which purpose open letters of credit shall be furnished you authorising you to draw
on the Executive of the U. S. or any of its officers in any part of the world, on which
drafts can be disposed of, and to apply with our recommendations to the Consuls,
agents, merchants, or citizens of any nation with which we have intercourse,
assuring them in our name that any aids they may furnish you, shall honorably
repaid, and on demand. Our consuls Thomas Howes at Batavia in Java, William
Buchanan on the isles of France and Bourbon, & John Elmslie at the Cape of good
hope will be able to supply your necessities by draughts on us.
Should you find it safe to return by the way you go, after sending two of your party
round by sea, or with your whole party, if no conveyance by sea can be found, do
so; making such observations on your return as may serve to supply, correct or
confirm those made on your outward journey.
In re-entering the U. S. and reaching a place of safety, discharge any of your
attendants who may desire & deserve it, procuring for them immediate paiment of all
arrears of pay & cloathing which may have incurred since their departure; & assure
them that they shall be recommended to the liberality of the legislature for the grant
of a soldier's portion of land each, as proposed in my message to Congress & repair
yourself with your papers to the seat of government.
To provide, on the accident of your death, against anarchy, dispersion & the
consequent danger to your party, and total failure of the enterprise, you are hereby
authorised, by any instrument signed & written in your hand, to name the person
among them who shall succeed to the command on your decease, & by like
instruments to

Page 487
change the nomination from time to time, as further experience of the characters
accompanying you shall point out superior fitness; and all the powers & authorities
given to yourself are, in the event of your death, transferred to & vested in the
successor so named, with further power to him, & his successors in like manner to
name each his successor, who, on the death of his predecessor, shall be invested
with all the powers & authorities given to yourself.

The Permanent Party
Commanding:
Meriwether Lewis, Captain 1st U.S. Infantry
William Clark, Second Lieutenant, U.S. Corps of Artillerists
Sergeants:
John Ordway
Nathaniel Pryor
Charlies Floyd (died August 20 1804)
Patrick Gass (appointed August 26 1804, in place of Floyd)
Interpreters:1
George Drewyer (properly spelled Drouillard, apparently)
Touissant Charbonneau
Privates:
William Bratton
John Collins
John Colter
Peter Cruzatte
Joseph Fields
Reuben Fields
1 This is a special rank, created so that those who held it could be paid at a
higher rate than privates or noncoms. (Interpreters were paid $25 per month,
sergeants $8, enlisted men $5.) Drewyer's appointment was dated January 1
1804, though he had been engaged the previous November; Charbonneau's
was dated April 7 1805, though he had served since November 1804. Cruzatte
and Labiche regularly acted as interpreters, but at a private's pay.

There can be little doubt that the above is the roster of Deschamps' party, though it
numbers ten, whereas Biddle makes it nine. Perhaps the discrepancy is explained by
the assignment of one boatman to Warfington's pirogue. (Journals, I, 31.)
Conceivably this may also explain the assignment of Rivet to Floyd's mess. On
August 21 1806, when the expedition is nearing the Arikara village on its return
journey, Clark records meeting "Reeved & Greinyea," who "wintered with us at the
Mandans in 1804." (Journals, V, 34950.) Later in the same entry he speaks of them
as "Reevey & Grienway." On the authority of Mrs. E. E. Dye, a novelist, Thwaites
identifies these men (Journals, I, 283) as ''François Rivet and Philippe Degie,"
engagés of the expedition who were "locally celebrated'' in Oregon, where they are
buried, "as being men who had been with Lewis and Clark." No one named Degie
and no one whose name resembles Greinyea or Grienway is mentioned anywhere in
the Journals. In his entry for the next day, August 22, Clark says that at the Arikara
village, "we found a french man by the name of Rokey who was one of our Engagees
as high as the Mandans," who asked, and was permitted, to accompany the
expedition to St. Louis. There is no other mention of him.
2 The spelling of his name is uncertain. Also, Ordway's journal calls him Jo
Barter.
3 Status uncertain. On May 26 1804, when the messes were formed, he was
attached to Floyd's, not Deschamps'.

BERNARD DEVOTO was born in Ogden, Utah, in 1897 and was educated at the University
of Utah and Harvard College. From 1922 to 1936 he taught English literature, first at
Northwestern, then at Harvard. He published many novels and collections of essays, and
for almost twenty years, from 1935 to the mid-1950s, wrote the "Easy Chair" column for
Harper's Magazine.
Mark Twain's America (1932) established DeVoto as a leading authority on Samuel
Clemens, a reputation furthered by Mark Twain in Eruption (edited, 1940) and Mark Twain
at Work (1942). The Year of Decision (1943), a chronicle of 1846, was the first volume of
a trilogy on America's westward expansion; it was followed by Across the Wide Missouri
(1947), which won both a Pulitzer Prize and the Bancroft Prize, and The Course of Empire
(1952), which won the National Book Award for nonfiction. These three books, wrote
Wallace Stegner, "are not merely history as record, they are history as literature. . . .
They seem to me to warrant all the superlatives that they have consistently won; they
belong on the shelf that contains only Prescott, Bancroft, Motley, Adams, and Parkman."
The Journals of Lewis and Clark (1953), a kind of coda to the trilogy, was DeVoto's last
great work. He died in Boston in 1955.
STEPHEN E. AMBROSE is the author of Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas
Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West (1996). Among his many other books
are the best-selling D-Day (1994) and multivolume biographies of Dwight D. Eisenhower
and Richard Nixon. He is founder of the Eisenhower Center and president of the National
D-Day Museum, both in New Orleans. He lives in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, and Helena,
Montana.
