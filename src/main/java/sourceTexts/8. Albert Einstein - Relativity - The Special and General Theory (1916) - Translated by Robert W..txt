R E L AT I V I T Y
albert einstein, one of the greatest thinkers of the twentieth
century, was born in 1879 in Ulm, Germany, to German-Jewish
parents. As a young adult, he moved to Switzerland, where he became a citizen and where he published his ﬁrst great theories in the
early 1900s, while working as a patent clerk. It was as a professor
at the University of Berlin that he ﬁnished the general theory of
relativity in 1915–17. Later, Einstein left Germany and came to
the United States to join the Institute for Advanced Study at
Princeton. In his later years he became more interested in social issues and penned several books, including About Zionism, on the
state of Israel. He died in 1955 at the age of seventy-six.
Educated as a physicist at Cambridge University, nigel calder
began his full-time writing career on the original staff of New Scientist magazine, and later became its editor. In 1966 he left that
job to devote himself independently to his own writing. Calder’s
subjects have ranged from particle physics to social psychology.
One of his many books is the best-selling Einstein’s Universe,
which Penguin reissued in an updated form in 2005 in celebration
of the 100th anniversary of Einstein’s ﬁrst groundbreaking theories. He lives in Sussex, England, with his wife, Liz, an artist and
former teacher of Italian.

Introduction

“What really interests me is whether God had any choice in the
creation of the world.” At the centenary of Albert Einstein’s
birth, in 1979, I scripted that comment of his into a TV documentary about relativity. Some broadcasters expunged it from
the soundtrack because they thought it was blasphemous. In
truth it was a reverential remark, and the question remains a
shrewd one.
The relativity theories explained by Einstein in this book supply some of the basic rules that any properly functioning universe must obey. They make sure that atoms and natural forces
will behave in the same way anywhere, across the great oceans
of space and time. A supplementary rule helps to explain how
stars and life can go on running for billions of years.
When all the rules are known, will it turn out that only one
possible kind of universe can be both self-consistent and congenial for life? For any young would-be Einstein of today, the
question is still on the table. And as the maestro commented
on another occasion, to persevere with such difﬁcult trains of
thought requires feelings like those of “a religious person or a
lover.”
For you, the inquisitive reader, a sense of trying to read the
mind of God—or to chat up Mother Nature, if you prefer—is
an encouragement to accompany Einstein through the forest of
tricky ideas contained in this slim volume. You will bear with
him even when, from time to time, he uses a little high school
mathematics to consolidate the reasoning. The payoff is worth
the mental effort.
Addressing you person-to-person, Einstein certainly wants

viii

i n t ro du c t i o n

you to join him in his intellectual adventure. Gratuitous mystiﬁcation and hero worship, which sometimes contaminate other
people’s accounts of relativity, are absent here. As a writer, Einstein takes great pains to ﬁnd examples and analogies to explain
his points, but he pursues no prizes for his prose. He shares the
opinion of the physicist Ludwig Boltzmann who said that,
“Matters of elegance ought to be left to the tailor and to the
cobbler.”
When he wrote this book in German in 1916, Einstein’s name
was scarcely known outside the physics institutes. He had just
completed his masterpiece, the general theory of relativity. It provided a brand-new theory of gravity and it promised a new perspective on the cosmos as a whole. He set out at once to share his
excitement with as wide a public as possible. But World War I
was raging at the time and English-speaking countries scorned all
things German.
After the war, two British expeditions to the South Atlantic
observed the total eclipse of the sun in May 1919. The astronomers photographed stars shifting in the sky, in a way that
was said to support the Berlin professor’s outlandish ideas.
Newton’s law of gravity was apparently out of date. Announced
in London on November 6, 1919, the news made Einstein a
celebrity overnight.
“The typhoon of publicity crossed the Atlantic,” Ernest
Rutherford noted. As the discoverer of the atomic nucleus, he
was a rival for fame. Robert W. Lawson, a British physicist who
had polished his knowledge of German while a prisoner of war
in Austria, translated this book into English. He secured Einstein’s blessing for the book’s publication in 1920, and the eclipse
results were included in an appendix.
So why not engage in a little time travel? Imagine that it’s
the aftermath of World War I. The usual method of long-range
travel is still by railroad train. The U.S. government has prohibited alcohol, and bootleggers are admiring the newly developed Thompson submachine gun. Al Jolson and his song
“Swanee” are all the rage. And that German chap’s account
of how he upstaged the great Isaac Newton is here in your
hands.

EINSTEIN’S FIRST THIRTY-SEVEN YEARS
The transition from relative obscurity to a prominence unmatched by movie stars, signaled by the translation of this book,
is also a moment to reﬂect on Einstein’s life till then. Born in
Ulm in Germany in 1879, Albert was the son of an entrepreneurial electrician (seldom successful) and a musically-minded
mother. In the following year the family moved to Munich. Albert’s budding brain was enthused by a magnet given to him at
the age of ﬁve, and by a book on Euclid’s “holy geometry” as he
called it, when he was twelve.
From sixteen onward, Einstein studied in Switzerland. He was
brilliant and negligent by turns and often preoccupied with his
own thoughts. In 1900, aged twenty-one, he obtained a diploma
as a science teacher from the Federal Institute of Technology in
Zurich, but then had great difﬁculty securing a job. His private
life was in a mess. Fellow student Mileva Maric was pregnant
with his child, Einstein’s parents opposed a marriage, and anyway he was broke.
Not until the summer of 1902 did Einstein secure a permanent
job, as a technical ofﬁcer at the Swiss Patent Ofﬁce. He married
Mileva, and they settled in Bern. Their ﬁrst child disappeared
mysteriously—she was presumably adopted and/or died—but in
1904 the ﬁrst of two sons was born.
After a solid day’s work at the ofﬁce, evaluating all sorts of
inventions, Einstein would spend his spare time on fundamental physics, working at the table in the family apartment. The
resulting papers went to the Annalen der Physik, which tolerantly published his ideas. He also wrote many review articles
for that journal, on other people’s physics.
Einstein was neither a competent experimenter nor a highpowered mathematician. His intuition about scientiﬁc concepts
was unequaled, and when logic was on his side he would stick
his neck far out, even when his conclusions ran counter to the
received wisdom. A reinterpretation of the photoelectric effect
was his ﬁrst spectacular contribution, proving that light can behave as if it consists of particles, not waves.

x

i n t ro du c t i o n

That was the subject of a paper written in March 1905,
shortly before his twenty-sixth birthday. During the next few
weeks Einstein completed two groundbreaking papers on molecular physics. In May he solved a puzzle about the speed of
light that had taunted him for years, and before the end of June
he had sent his ﬁrst paper on relativity to Annalen der Physik.
Three months later he followed it with a related paper on the
equivalence of energy and mass.
No wonder 1905 is called, in retrospect, Einstein’s miracle
year. Yet the academic world was extremely slow to react. Not
until 1909 was he able to give up his job at the Patent Ofﬁce, on
becoming an assistant professor at Zurich University. Thereafter his career took off, with a quick succession of posts in
other universities culminating in a very prestigious appointment
in Berlin, where he settled in 1914.
All the while he was struggling to generalize his ideas about
relativity. The special theory of 1905 dealt with conﬂicting
views of the world that result from relative movements at a
steady speed. If he could extend it to accelerated motions, a
new theory of gravity would be in his grasp. He had the right
ideas from 1907 onward, but the mathematics was so tricky
that the general theory of relativity was not perfected until 1915.
Just as he was beginning to apply it to the overall nature of the
universe, he spared the time needed to write the present book.
He was then age thirty-seven.

SPACE, TIME, AND LIGHT ALONG
A RAILROAD
Einstein starts his book by asking whether Euclid’s geometry is
true. The Greek compendium about how lines and shapes relate
to one another, on a ﬂat surface, has been the bedrock of practical mathematics for two thousand years. Yet it is deﬁnitely correct only in abstract logic. In the real world, so Einstein warns
us, its truth may turn out to be limited.
This is a distant, ranging shot, and Section 1 may puzzle some

i n t ro du c t i o n

xi

readers, because Einstein does not return to Euclid’s vulnerability
until halfway through the book. Its early appearance means that
the author wants to shock us into thinking about things in his
way. Euclid not necessarily correct? That was ﬁghting talk in
1920.
Nowadays scientists can directly test geometry across the
solar system, because radar echoes from planets, and signals
to and from spacecraft, can measure relative distances. The old
rules about triangles, for example, don’t work exactly. Rather
than complain that Euclid was wrong, the scientists now prefer
to say that the empty space in the solar system is not perfectly
“ﬂat” in Euclid’s sense. The way gravity deforms space and
time is what general relativity is all about.
But ﬁrst Einstein leads us into special relativity and the effects of motion—special because it excludes accelerated movement. In Sections 2 to 4 he erects the traditional scaffolding
of the physical world, which his theories are going to shake,
namely the system of coordinates used for pinpointing events
and tracing movements. There are three dimensions of space
x, y, and z (meaning left-right, forward-back, and up-down)
and one dimension of time t.
Events can look very different to onlookers in different situations, especially if they are moving relative to one another. In
Section 3, Einstein introduces the railroad (the “railway” to the
British translator) that sets the scene for his reasoning for many
pages that follow. The ﬁrst example of different viewpoints
comes when I drop a stone from the window of a moving train.
I see the stone go straight down from my hand to the ground. If
you watch from the side of the track, you’ll see it following a
curved (parabolic) path, because the stone inherits some sideways motion from the train.
In Section 4, Einstein equips the observers in the train and by
the track with clocks, so that each has a complete coordinate
system—a personal frame of reference in space and time. So far
so obvious, but in Section 5 Einstein gives a preliminary hint
that the world will get out of joint when light comes into the
story. That is the meaning of his reference to developments in
“electrodynamics and optics.”

xii

i n t ro du c t i o n

Approaching the tricky bit gradually, Einstein reasons that
the laws of nature ought not to depend on who is watching. A
raven ﬂying in a straight line will appear to be going straight
to an observer in a moving train, even though he’ll reckon the
bird’s course and speed differently from a trackside observer.
Similarly the laws of nature observed on the earth don’t change
between winter and summer, even though our planet reverses its
direction of travel around the sun as it hurries along in its orbit
at 30 kilometers per second. A century after Einstein formulated these ideas, the absence of any seasonal variation in physical laws has been checked to the highest precision for which
you could ever wish.
Next, Einstein turns to the way speeds can be combined. In
Section 6 a man walks forward along a moving train. An onlooker beside the track may reckon how fast the man is advancing by simply adding his speed of walking to the train’s velocity,
but that will turn out to be an oversimpliﬁcation. The ﬁrst clue
comes in Section 7, when Einstein imagines a beam of light
being sent along a railroad embankment in the same direction
as a train is traveling. He asks how fast the light goes in relation
to the train.
“Classical” ideas tempt you to think that the light must be
going more slowly as judged from the train, because you should
subtract the train’s speed. Not so, says Einstein. If a traveler on
the train could measure the speed of the beam of light for himself, the result would be exactly the same as the speed of the
same beam measured by someone stationary on the ground.

THE CONSTANT SPEED OF LIGHT
How does Einstein know that the movement of a source of
light, or of the detector that registers its arrival, has no effect
on the speed of light as measured by any observer? When he
developed the special theory of relativity in 1905, his conviction about this crucial point depended on his intuition and on
the theories of a Dutch physicist, Hendrik Lorentz. But in
1913, before he wrote this book, Einstein was rewarded

i n t ro du c t i o n

xiii

with strong supporting evidence when a Dutch astronomer,
Willem de Sitter, considered pairs of stars that orbit around
each other.
Sometimes a star swings towards the earth, as it circles its
partner, and sometimes it’s receding on the other side of its
partner. These phases of its orbit are distinguishable by shifts in
frequency of the starlight, and they follow at regular intervals.
If the light traveled faster when emitted by the star approaching
the earth, it would overtake the light from the previous retreating phase and smear out the alternations. As astronomers can
easily distinguish the comings and goings, de Sitter reasoned
that the constancy of the speed of light was conﬁrmed.
Astronomy at invisible frequencies, which travel at the same
speed as visible light, has reﬁned de Sitter’s test. An X-ray star
in another galaxy, the Small Magellanic Cloud, is orbiting
around an unseen companion. It lies so far away that the slightest discrepancy in the light speed, due to the star’s own speed,
would be detectable.
Gamma-ray bursts come from stupendous explosions that
occur almost out to the limits of the observable universe. Even
after taking billions of years to reach us, some bursts last for
only a split second. That means there can be no difference at all
in the speeds of emission from rapidly moving parts of the violently erupting source. The brevity of gamma-ray bursts now
makes the constancy of light speed in empty space one of the
surest facts in the whole of science.
With this hindsight, Einstein’s conviction is correct. But the
puzzle illustrated by the railroad train and the relative speed of
the light beam “has plunged the conscientiously thoughtful
physicist into the greatest intellectual difﬁculties.” The special
theory of relativity is promised as the solution.

TIME BECOMES SLIPPERY
Two lightning ﬂashes are said to strike the railroad embankment
at the same moment at different places, and Einstein spends several pages fretting about the meaning of “simultaneous” (Sections

xiv

i n t ro du c t i o n

8 and 9). After a mock dialogue with the reader, who supposedly defends old-fashioned thinking about the idea of time in
physics, Einstein offers an exact deﬁnition. The lightning strokes
are simultaneous if their light rays meet at the midpoint on the
embankment between the places where they strike.
But from the point of view of a rider on a moving train, who
happens to be midway between the points of impact when the
lightning strikes, the ﬂashes cannot be simultaneous. This observer will see the ﬂash up ahead slightly before the one behind,
because the train has moved him forward to meet its approaching rays.
Once simultaneity becomes only a relative concept, time itself goes haywire. What the observer on the embankment considers to be one second is not one second for the person on the
train. As a result (in Section 10) the speed of a person walking
forward along the train, as judged from the embankment, turns
out to be different from the speed of walking judged on the
train itself. And the length of the train itself will appear different too.
To make these crazy-seeming propositions precise, Einstein
brings in a mathematical device called the Lorentz transformation, named after the Dutch physicist mentioned earlier. Don’t
worry if you can’t follow it all. Section 11 (reinforced by Appendix 1) explains why the same beam of light has the same
speed whether judged by a stationary or a moving observer.
Time runs more slowly for the moving observer, to exactly the
extent needed to secure the constancy of light speed.
Similar mathematics in Section 12 tells you why no ordinary
object could ever travel faster than light. It also shows that a
measuring rod moving past you will appear shorter than when
it is at rest; hence, the remark about the length of the train. Einstein’s way of putting it suggests a squeezing. In a more modern
gloss, the rod, or the train, appears to be slightly rotated away
from you as it passes, and so you see it foreshortened to the extent predicted by the formula.
Einstein then returns to the question of how velocities are to
be added together (Section 13). When this situation cropped up
earlier, with a person walking forward along a moving train,

i n t ro du c t i o n

xv

the simpleminded answer was to add the man’s speed to the
train’s speed. But in relativity the combined speed as gauged by
a stationary watcher has to be reduced a little.
With some satisfaction, Einstein revisits an experiment ﬁrst
devised by a French physicist, Armand Fizeau, in 1851. By measuring the speed of light in water ﬂowing down a tube, it unwittingly tested Einstein’s formula for adding velocities. Repeated
by Pieter Zeeman (yet another Dutchman, and a colleague of
Lorentz), the experiment conﬁrmed the formula’s accuracy to
within 1 percent.

MASS AND ENERGY
When this book was written, practicable speeds of motion were
too slow, and clocks and rulers too imprecise, to test many predictions of special relativity directly. Undismayed, Einstein went
on to make some sweeping inferences from his theory. His
assertion, in Section 14, that any general law of nature must be
consistent with special relativity, reconﬁrms his early requirement that the laws of nature cannot depend on who is looking.
Einstein’s own most famous law is that mass and energy are
equivalent. In Section 15 he introduces the idea by way of another remarkable prediction of special relativity, namely that
the mass of a body increases when it travels at high speed. In
classical physics it gains in energy of motion. In relativity that
kinetic energy makes itself felt as additional mass.
Radiant energy absorbed by a body also increases its mass.
Indeed the total mass becomes a measure of its total energy. But
in this reckoning the body starts with inherent energy even
when at rest. It is a huge amount, given by the body’s rest mass
multiplied by the square of the speed of light, or E  mc2.
Concentrations of energy available in 1916 were too small in
relation to experimental masses for this equivalence of mass and
energy to be tested. And in Section 16, when Einstein trawls for
evidence in support of special relativity as a whole, the haul is
meager—just small deviations from classical expectations in
experiments with electrons, and a favorable gloss that he can put

xvi

i n t ro du c t i o n

on the failure to detect any difference in the speed of light in two
directions at right angles, in a nineteenth-century experiment.
Modern particle accelerators conﬁrm Einstein’s predictions
more directly. They prolong the life of unstable subatomic
particles by achieving speeds that stretch time for them. The
masses of accelerated particles increase to the point where new
matter can be created from them. E  mc2 accounts for the longlasting power of the sun and the stars, and appears as the nuclear energy that power engineers and bomb-makers have learned
how to tap.
To trace all the consequences of special relativity now veriﬁed
by scientists would be to recapitulate much of the physics and
astronomy of the past one hundred years. Perhaps the crowning
glory is antimatter, predicted by Paul Dirac in England when he
applied special relativity to the theory of subatomic particles.
Antimatter is now known to shower down from the sky above
us, and when a particle meets its antiparticle, both of them disappear in a burst of radiant energy, exactly in accordance with
E  mc2.

ONWARD TO GENERAL RELATIVITY
“The non-mathematician is seized by a mysterious shuddering
when he hears of ‘four-dimensional’ things, by a feeling not unlike that awakened by thoughts of the occult. And yet there is
no more common-place statement than that the world in which
we live is a four-dimensional space-time continuum.”
Einstein makes this remark at the start of Section 17, which
is a preamble about geometry for the transition from special relativity to general relativity. Figuring prominently is the mathematician Hermann Minkowski, who had called Einstein “a lazy
dog” when teaching him in Zurich. Minkowski invented a mathematical trick that treats time as if it were just an extra dimension of space. Appendix 2 has a little more on this subject.
Without this method, the juggling with space-time whereby
Einstein revolutionized the theory of gravity would have been
much more difﬁcult.

i n t ro du c t i o n

xvii

The different meanings of special and general relativity appear in Section 18. The democratic principle that Einstein is
pursuing requires the laws of nature to remain the same regardless of how the observer is moving. While the special theory
compares different views of the world due to uniform motion,
as in the railroad train moving steadily along the track, the general theory removes that restriction and allows for all kinds of
movement, including acceleration and rotation.
Some puzzles about gravity are set out in Section 19. Whatever the “intermediary medium” is, which pulls a stone down
when we drop it, it acts equally on any other object. Everything
falls with the same acceleration, if there’s no air resistance. And
isn’t it odd that the force of gravity acting on a body is proportional to its mass—exactly the same quality that crops up when
you gauge the body’s resistance to acceleration, its inertia? These
features ﬁnd an explanation in Section 20, when gravity is seen
to be very like any other accelerating system.
Einstein invites us to visualize a man living in a big chest
that’s drifting in empty space. He must tie himself to the ﬂoor if
he is not to ﬂoat about. The modern reader has seen videos of
astronauts drifting weightlessly in their spaceships, but Einstein
has to picture it for himself.
Unable to invoke a space rocket to propel the box, he imagines a “being” pulling on a rope attached to the lid of the chest
and imparting a steady acceleration. The man in the chest can
then think himself at home on the earth. He no longer tends to
ﬂoat, and any object he releases will fall to the ﬂoor. The steady
acceleration through empty space will feel to him just like gravity. What’s more, the simulation fully accounts for the equal effect of gravity on all objects, and for the equality of inertial and
gravitational mass.
A similar situation prevails for a person on a train when the
brakes are applied hard. He can say, if he wishes, that he is
jerked forward by a short-lived gravitational ﬁeld. It also slows
down the embankment (and the planet in general) that were
rushing past him while he sat stationary in his own frame of
reference. By this time the reader may think that the reasoning
is quaint, but in Section 21 it’s clear that Einstein is in earnest.

xviii

i n t ro du c t i o n

He is simply stressing that, in general relativity, no point of
view can take preference over any other.

GRAVITY BENDS LIGHT
The similarity between gravity and any other acceleration
means that light must be affected by gravity like any other substance. This crucial ingredient of Einstein’s theory ﬁrst appears
in Section 22. There he predicts that the light from a star grazing the sun will be deﬂected, so that it will change its apparent
position in the sky by 1.7 seconds of arc (roughly one twothousandths of a degree). At the time of an eclipse, he says, stars
seen beyond the sun ought to appear shifted outwards from the
sun to that sort of extent, compared with their normal positions
in the sky. This was the prediction that made Einstein famous.
He was doubly lucky. When wrestling with his early ideas
about general relativity, in 1911, he published a wrong answer
for the deﬂection of starlight—half the correct result. The outbreak of World War I prevented astronomers from testing Einstein’s prediction at the total eclipse of 1914, before he came up
with the right number in 1915.
The second stroke of luck was that the British astronomer
Arthur Eddington, who led the effort to test it at the eclipse of
1919, was predisposed to believe Einstein’s theory. Looking for
star-shifts of less than a millimeter on the photographic plates,
Eddington’s team put aside several plates that gave “wrong” results, and picked ’n’ mixed the rest until the average was about
right (see Appendix 3b). It was pretty sloppy science, yet Eddington let the message ring out around the world: “Newton’s
theory of gravity is dead—long live Einstein’s!”
Fortunately, light bending to the extent required by general
relativity has been amply veriﬁed since then. Radio waves are
invisible light, and astronomers used widely spaced radio telescopes in accurate observations of Quasar 3C279, which regularly
passes behind the sun. A European star-mapping satellite called
Hipparcos (1989–93) detected the deﬂection of starlight even
from stars lying far from the sun’s direction in the sky. Hipparcos

i n t ro du c t i o n

xix

scientists were able to verify Einstein’s theory to an accuracy of
1
–
of 1 percent.
10
Gravitational lenses lying far away in the universe give an upto-date demonstration of light bending in the Einsteinian fashion. The gravity of a cluster of galaxies, and of invisible dark
matter associated with it, acts as an untidy magniﬁer. It enhances the view of even more distant galaxies by magnifying
them, albeit with distortion and multiple images.

COMING CLEAN ABOUT
THE SPEED OF LIGHT
An ordinary lens works by delaying the light passing through it,
because light travels more slowly through glass than through
air. The same is true of gravitational lenses. Einstein comments
in Section 22 that, against all expectations from special relativity, the deﬂection of light by gravity implies a change in the speed
of light in the sun’s vicinity. “A curvature of rays of light can
only take place when the velocity of propagation of light varies
with position.”
What a pity that remark was not printed in italics in Einstein’s
book, or painted on balloons for all to see! Researchers and
teachers ignored it for half a century, until radar echoes from
Venus and Mercury in the late 1960s turned changes in the
speed of light into an observed fact. Radar pulses sent out from
the Haystack observatory in Massachusetts were clearly delayed
whenever the planets were on the far side of the sun, as seen
from the earth. The radio waves (a variety of light) slowed down
as they passed the sun on their outward and return journey.
Even in the 1970s it was hard to get more than the most
grudging admission from experts on relativity that gravity
slows down light, although Einstein himself was unabashed
about it sixty years earlier. Undue emphasis on the constancy
of light speed made general relativity unnecessarily opaque to
students and the general public for several decades. Just come
clean, and admit that light dawdles a little near a massive object

xx

i n t ro du c t i o n

like the sun, and Einstein’s theory of gravity is far easier to understand.
The experts were not being entirely perverse. One of the glories of general relativity is that the speed of light does indeed
remain the same, provided you measure it on the spot. If you
could station a heat-resistant spacecraft beside the sun to gauge
Haystack’s radar pulses whizzing past, they would seem to be
traveling at just the usual speed of light. The reason is that time,
too, runs more slowly in the spacecraft, under the inﬂuence of the
sun’s strong gravity. It’s only the distant observer, with a faster
clock, who notices the slowdown.
In special relativity, you’ll remember, different rates of time
on the train and on the embankment enabled the observers to
get the same answer for the speed of light. In general relativity,
too, changes in clock-rates always keep the speed the same, as
measured locally. That’s how Einstein ensures that natural laws
hold good everywhere. Despite the effects of stronger gravity,
atoms, particles, and radiant energy on the sun interact according to exactly the same laws as on the earth.
To say so is to run ahead of the chain of explanation in this
book. These retrospective hints may nevertheless give you a sense
of destination, as Einstein approaches “a serious difﬁculty” that
“lies at the heart of things” and “lays no small claims on the patience and on the power of abstraction of the reader.” Also helpful, perhaps, is to note that the next step in the argument matches
an idea illustrated in the science ﬁction movie 2001: A Space
Odyssey, where a large space station simulates normal gravity
by centrifugal force. The station rotates at an appropriate speed
and the astronauts walk around a ﬂoor at the rim, with their
feet pointing outwards, away from the center.

SLITHERING IN SPACE-TIME
The usual picture of gravity is turned inside out in Section 23,
by putting an observer on a disc that is rotating. He feels a force
pushing him outward, and like the man in the accelerated box he

i n t ro du c t i o n

xxi

is authorized by general relativity to call it gravity—a peculiar
kind of gravity that becomes stronger the farther you are from
the center.
The man is also moving relative to the center of the disc. Recalling the effects of relative motion between a train and the
track, Einstein notes that the man’s clock will run more slowly
than a clock at the center of the disc. What’s more, if he puts a
measuring rod along the edge of the disc in the direction of
movement, to start measuring the circumference, the rod will
be shorter than it would be at the center. On the other hand, the
rod is not shortened when pointing toward the center of the disc,
to measure the diameter. As a result, the circumference of the
disc will seem to be greater than the diameter multiplied by  (pi,
3.14 . . . ) which would be the case if the disc were at rest.
When the effective length of a measuring rod can change, Euclid’s geometry for ﬂat surfaces no longer works. General relativity needs a suppler frame of reference, which Einstein sets
up in Sections 24 to 28. First he imagines a rectangular grid of
rods laid out on a marble slab, which goes askew if you heat
part of the slab and some of the rods expand in length. The
squares of the grid are no longer square.
Not to worry. Carl Friedrich Gauss, a German mathematician and physicist who ﬂourished in the early nineteenth century, devised a system of coordinates in which the grid can be
crooked and the lines curved. And just as Minkowski added
time to the three dimensions of space in a rectangular system,
Einstein adds supple time to Gauss’s supple system for describing space. Then, like a child in a ﬂoppy climbing-frame, he has
a framework of space-time in which to play with his general
theory of relativity.
Einstein imagines his four-dimensional world to be inhabited
by slithery creatures—he calls them molluscs—that can move
about and change shape ad lib. General relativity requires that all
molluscs should have “equal right and equal success” in formulating the laws of nature. This invertebrate democracy might
seem like a recipe for total confusion. Instead it imposes such
strict legislation on the universe that the distortions of space-time

xxii

i n t ro du c t i o n

due to the inﬂuences of massive bodies provide a precise and
novel theory of gravity.

IMPROVING ON NEWTON
The mathematics that Einstein used to tame his supple spacetime is too abstruse for the wide readership he aims for in this
book. He contents himself with summarizing some key results,
in Section 29. First, Newton’s law of gravity, in which the gravitational force between two bodies is inversely proportional to
the square of the distance between them, springs ready-made
from the molluscs’ weird world. Unlike Newton, Einstein can
explain what is happening. Masses deform space, with the result that other masses follow curved tracks—as when the sun
forces the planets to orbit around it.
Moreover, Newton’s law of gravity is only approximately
correct. Deviations become evident where gravity is strong, and
they show how Einstein’s theory improves on Newton’s. One,
already mentioned, is the extent of the bending of starlight when
it passes near the sun. Another improvement concerns the
misbehavior of the planet Mercury, ﬁrst noticed by the French
astronomer Urbain Leverrier in 1865, which ﬁnds a ready explanation in Einstein’s theory of gravity.
The planet’s elliptical orbit around the sun gradually swivels
because of interactions with other planets, but this “precession” is greater than predicted by Newton’s theory. Searches
for an unknown planet that might explain the discrepancy were
unavailing. The explanation is slightly stronger gravity near the
sun, provided by Einstein’s theory. All planetary orbits are affected but Mercury’s the most because it is closest to the sun
(see also Appendix 3a).
Radar observations of Mercury later conﬁrmed that the swiveling matches Einstein’s theory to a high degree of accuracy.
More spectacular in this regard is a pulsating radio star, or pulsar, discovered in 1974. It goes very closely around and around
a silent companion, on an orbit that swivels far more rapidly
than Mercury’s. In a double pulsar reported in 2004, the effect

i n t ro du c t i o n

xxiii

is even greater. These systems are also seen to be shedding energy, supposedly by radiating gravitational waves that Einstein
predicted in 1916.
The third innovation from general relativity described in this
book is nowadays known to scientists as the gravitational redshift. Einstein mentions it only brieﬂy in Section 29 but gives
more detail in Appendix 3c, where he writes: “An atom absorbs
or emits light of a frequency which is dependent on the potential of the gravitational ﬁeld in which it is situated.” As a symptom of gravity’s amazing power to slow down time, the
characteristic light emitted by atoms and molecules—their spectral lines—will appear to distant observers to have lower frequencies in strong gravity than on the earth or in empty space.
They will be shifted towards the red end of the spectrum.
Veriﬁcation of the gravitational red-shift came in 1924. Walter
Adams in California discovered that Sirius B is a very dense
star, the ﬁrst white dwarf ever identiﬁed. He reported that some
emissions from hydrogen atoms showed marked reductions
in frequency as required by Einstein’s theory. Much as with the
1919 eclipse story, historians of science question the reliability
of Adams’s result. The light from Sirius B was contaminated by
light from the much brighter Sirius A.
Never mind. The gravitational red-shift is now observed
routinely in many astronomical objects including the sun. Even
more convincingly for nonastronomers, the effect of gravity in
slowing time is demonstrated directly with atomic clocks. They
run faster in high-ﬂying aircraft than they do on the ground.

A COSMOLOGICAL SKETCH
Part III of the book is entitled “Considerations on the Universe
as a Whole.” It is very brief, and lest it should disappoint anyone familiar with Einstein’s contributions to cosmology, be
aware that when he wrote this book for the general public in
1916, his ideas were still maturing. A key scientiﬁc paper, “Cosmological Considerations on the General Theory of Relativity,”
did not appear until the following year.

xxiv

i n t ro du c t i o n

Astronomical knowledge of the time, primitive by contemporary standards, misleads Einstein badly. Like Newton, he
imagines stars scattered through the immensity of space and
moving about only slowly. He is troubled, as Newton was,
by the problem that gravity will tend to drag all the stars together. This outcome might be avoided if the stars were very
evenly scattered, which was Newton’s own suggestion. By Einstein’s young days, astronomers knew very well that the stars
of the Milky Way are not at all uniform in their distribution.
To avoid having all the stars fall together in a heap, the German astronomer Hugo von Seeliger suggested that gravity must
weaken at long ranges, more rapidly than prescribed by Newton’s inverse square law. This is the main theme of Section 30.
Einstein indicates that he might welcome such an idea if only
there were a logical reason for it.
Another approach to the problem of the collapsing starﬁeld appears in Section 31. Einstein proposes that cosmic space may be
folded back upon itself. He invites us to share the worldview of
ﬂat beings living on what they perceive as a ﬂat, two-dimensional
surface, but which is in fact a sphere of large but ﬁnite size.
There is no boundary to the ﬂat creatures’ universe. If they traveled far enough they would come back to their starting point,
on a great circle. Without having to make a world tour, the ﬂat
beings can ﬁgure out what kind of universe they are living in,
and even measure its diameter, by discovering subtle discrepancies between the predictions of Euclid for truly ﬂat surfaces,
and what they ﬁnd in practice.
Similarly, you can imagine a super-geometry in which our
own three-dimensional space is so folded that it is “ﬁnite” yet
“unbounded.” Such a universe is congenial for general relativity and promises a way of preventing the stars falling together.
This is Einstein’s assertion in the very brief Section 32 that,
except for the appendices, brings his book to a close. The story
ends abruptly with a cursory description of one possible form
for the universe, which Einstein happens to like. The reader is
left with a strong sense of unﬁnished business.
To pursue in any detail here the dramatic cosmology that

i n t ro du c t i o n

xxv

unfolded in the twentieth century would be too lengthy a departure from the main subjects of this book. Yet not to mention
Einstein’s cosmological constant  (lambda) would be unforgivable. He introduced it into his equations in 1917, as a device
akin to Seeliger’s idea of gravity weakening at long ranges. To
stop the stars falling together,  adjusted the strength of gravity
as required. Without , a universe is unstable and it must be either imploding or expanding, which was contrary to the myopic impressions of early twentieth-century astronomy.
The discovery in the 1920s of the great cosmic expansion, in
which the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies and the spaces
between clusters of galaxies grow rapidly, made Einstein think
he had blundered. Simply by leaving out , he might have predicted both the expanding universe and the Big Bang with
which it apparently began. Yet at the end of the twentieth century the expansion of the universe turned out to be accelerating,
and Einstein’s  has come back in triumph in the driving seat of
the cosmos.
And what about Euclid, with whom this book starts and ﬁnishes? Einstein wanted astronomers to emulate the ﬂat beings of
his folded two-dimensional universe and discover the overall
geometry of the real world. If the universe were not “ﬂat” in Euclid’s ideal sense, it should act as a lens, and very distant objects
should appear magniﬁed or shrunk. The most distant observable objects—clumps of hot gas that existed soon after the Big
Bang—are now mapped by radio microwaves and they look neither bigger nor smaller than expected. In the geometers’ heaven,
it’s a draw. Einstein trumps Euclid in the distorted space-time
surrounding planets, stars, and galaxies, but the geometry of the
universe at large still conforms very well to what that old Greek
taught his students in Alexandria 2,300 years ago.

GENERAL RELATIVITY STILL THRIVES
To say much about the rest of Einstein’s life story in this introduction might break the mental link that I have tried to fashion

xxvi

i n t ro du c t i o n

with the relatively young Einstein who wrote the book. He
would divorce Mileva and marry his cousin Elsa. The 1921 Nobel Prize would come his way—not for relativity but for his interpretation of the photoelectric effect. Later he would fall out
with his fellow physicists over the interpretation of the quantum theory. In 1932, as a Jewish refugee from the Nazis, he
would ﬁnd sanctuary in Princeton, New Jersey, and live there
until his death in 1955.
Much more relevant to the reader is the subsequent career of
Einstein’s cleverest brainchild, general relativity. Despite many
decades of efforts by experimenters and theorists to prove it imperfect, it still holds sway. Oft-repeated promises of a superior
quantum theory of gravity remain only a speculation.
A great theory should make surprising predictions that can
be veriﬁed by observation, and go on to take unexpected discoveries in its stride. General relativity has performed supremely
well on both counts. In addition to several successful tests already described, a huge effort is now going into the direct detection of gravitational waves, which should squeeze and stretch
space as they pass by. Failure to ﬁnd them would be surprising
because, as mentioned, the behavior of orbiting pulsars makes
sense only if they are radiating gravitational waves. Another
prediction currently under test with a satellite is that the earth
should drag space-time around it as it rotates.
The ﬁnest example of explaining the unexpected came with
the discovery of quasars in 1963. These compact sources of radiation in the hearts of some galaxies were far too powerful to
rely on the nuclear energy that lights the stars. Ready to hand
was an awful possibility implicit in general relativity. A massive
object might collapse into a black hole, which would then be
capable of squeezing huge amounts of energy out of any stars or
gas falling into it.
The idea of black holes won acceptance only gradually. Observations established the compactness of the quasars and the
presence of material feeding their hearty appetites. Not until
1994 did direct conﬁrmation of the reality of black holes come
in results from the Japanese satellite ASCA. Variations in the

i n t ro du c t i o n

xxvii

wavelength of X-ray emissions from iron atoms in a stormy
galaxy made a pattern predicted for material orbiting closely
around a black hole. And a loss of energy by individual X-ray
particles showed time slowing down in the intense gravity near
the black hole, just as general relativity requires.

Preface

The present book is intended, as far as possible, to give an exact
insight into the theory of Relativity to those readers who, from
a general scientiﬁc and philosophical point of view, are interested in the theory, but who are not conversant with the mathematical apparatus of theoretical physics. The work presumes a
standard of education corresponding to that of a university matriculation examination, and, despite the shortness of the book,
a fair amount of patience and force of will on the part of the
reader. The author has spared himself no pains in his endeavour
to present the main ideas in the simplest and most intelligible
form, and on the whole, in the sequence and connection in which
they actually originated. In the interest of clearness, it appeared
to me inevitable that I should repeat myself frequently, without
paying the slightest attention to the elegance of the presentation. I adhered scrupulously to the precept of that brilliant theoretical physicist L. Boltzmann, according to whom matters of
elegance ought to be left to the tailor and to the cobbler. I make
no pretence of having withheld from the reader difﬁculties
which are inherent to the subject. On the other hand, I have
purposely treated the empirical physical foundations of the theory in a “step-motherly” fashion, so that readers unfamiliar
with physics may not feel like the wanderer who was unable to
see the forest for trees. May the book bring some one a few
happy hours of suggestive thought!

Physical Meaning
of Geometrical Propositions

In your schooldays most of you who read this book made acquaintance with the noble building of Euclid’s geometry, and you
remember—perhaps with more respect than love—the magniﬁcent structure, on the lofty staircase of which you were chased
about for uncounted hours by conscientious teachers. By reason
of your past experience, you would certainly regard everyone
with disdain who should pronounce even the most out-of-theway proposition of this science to be untrue. But perhaps this
feeling of proud certainty would leave you immediately if some
one were to ask you: “What, then, do you mean by the assertion
that these propositions are true?” Let us proceed to give this question a little consideration.
Geometry sets out from certain conceptions such as “plane,”
“point,” and “straight line,” with which we are able to associate more or less deﬁnite ideas, and from certain simple propositions (axioms) which, in virtue of these ideas, we are inclined
to accept as “true.” Then, on the basis of a logical process, the
justiﬁcation of which we feel ourselves compelled to admit, all
remaining propositions are shown to follow from those axioms, i.e. they are proven. A proposition is then correct (“true”)
when it has been derived in the recognised manner from the axioms. The question of the “truth” of the individual geometrical
propositions is thus reduced to one of the “truth” of the axioms.
Now it has long been known that the last question is not only
unanswerable by the methods of geometry, but that it is in itself
entirely without meaning. We cannot ask whether it is true that
only one straight line goes through two points. We can only say
that Euclidean geometry deals with things called “straight lines,”

8

r e l at i v i t y

to each of which is ascribed the property of being uniquely determined by two points situated on it. The concept “true” does
not tally with the assertions of pure geometry, because by the
word “true” we are eventually in the habit of designating always
the correspondence with a “real” object; geometry, however, is
not concerned with the relation of the ideas involved in it to objects of experience, but only with the logical connection of these
ideas among themselves.
It is not difﬁcult to understand why, in spite of this, we feel
constrained to call the propositions of geometry “true.” Geometrical ideas correspond to more or less exact objects in nature, and these last are undoubtedly the exclusive cause of the
genesis of those ideas. Geometry ought to refrain from such a
course, in order to give to its structure the largest possible logical unity. The practice, for example, of seeing in a “distance”
two marked positions on a practically rigid body is something
which is lodged deeply in our habit of thought. We are accustomed further to regard three points as being situated on a
straight line, if their apparent positions can be made to coincide
for observation with one eye, under suitable choice of our place
of observation.
If, in pursuance of our habit of thought, we now supplement
the propositions of Euclidean geometry by the single proposition that two points on a practically rigid body always correspond to the same distance (line-interval), independently of any
changes in position to which we may subject the body, the
propositions of Euclidean geometry then resolve themselves
into propositions on the possible relative position of practically
rigid bodies.1 Geometry which has been supplemented in this
way is then to be treated as a branch of physics. We can now legitimately ask as to the “truth” of geometrical propositions interpreted in this way, since we are justiﬁed in asking whether
these propositions are satisﬁed for those real things we have
1

It follows that a natural object is associated also with a straight line. Three
points A, B and C on a rigid body thus lie in a straight line when, the points
A and C being given, B is chosen such that the sum of the distances A B and
B C is as short as possible. This incomplete suggestion will sufﬁce for our present purpose.

p h ys i c a l m e a n i n g o f g e o m e t r i c a l p ro p o s i t i o n s

associated with the geometrical ideas. In less exact terms we
can express this by saying that by the “truth” of a geometrical
proposition in this sense we understand its validity for a construction with ruler and compasses.
Of course the conviction of the “truth” of geometrical propositions in this sense is founded exclusively on rather incomplete experience. For the present we shall assume the “truth” of
the geometrical propositions, then at a later stage (in the general
theory of relativity) we shall see that this “truth” is limited, and
we shall consider the extent of its limitation.

t wo
The System of Co-ordinates

On the basis of the physical interpretation of distance which
has been indicated, we are also in a position to establish the
distance between two points on a rigid body by means of
measurements. For this purpose we require a “distance” (rod
S) which is to be used once and for all, and which we employ
as a standard measure. If, now, A and B are two points on a
rigid body, we can construct the line joining them according
to the rules of geometry; then, starting from A, we can mark
off the distance S time after time until we reach B. The number of these operations required is the numerical measure of
the distance A B. This is the basis of all measurement of
length.1
Every description of the scene of an event or of the position
of an object in space is based on the speciﬁcation of the point
on a rigid body (body of reference) with which that event or object coincides. This applies not only to scientiﬁc description, but
also to everyday life. If I analyse the place speciﬁcation “Trafalgar Square, London,”2 I arrive at the following result. The earth
is the rigid body to which the speciﬁcation of place refers;
“Trafalgar Square, London,” is a well-deﬁned point, to which

1

Here we have assumed that there is nothing left over, i.e. that the measurement gives a whole number. This difﬁculty is got over by the use of divided
measuring-rods, the introduction of which does not demand any fundamentally new method.
2
I have chosen this as being more familiar to the English reader than the “Potsdamer Platz, Berlin,” which is referred to in the original. (R. W. L., translator)

t h e sys t e m o f c o - o r d i n at e s

11

a name has been assigned, and with which the event coincides
in space.3
This primitive method of place speciﬁcation deals only with
places on the surface of rigid bodies, and is dependent on the
existence of points on this surface which are distinguishable
from each other. But we can free ourselves from both of these
limitations without altering the nature of our speciﬁcation of
position. If, for instance, a cloud is hovering over Trafalgar
Square, then we can determine its position relative to the surface of the earth by erecting a pole perpendicularly on the
Square, so that it reaches the cloud. The length of the pole measured with the standard measuring-rod, combined with the
speciﬁcation of the position of the foot of the pole, supplies us
with a complete place speciﬁcation. On the basis of this illustration, we are able to see the manner in which a reﬁnement of
the conception of position has been developed.
(a) We imagine the rigid body, to which the place speciﬁcation
is referred, supplemented in such a manner that the object whose
position we require is reached by the completed rigid body.
(b) In locating the position of the object, we make use of a
number (here the length of the pole measured with the measuringrod) instead of designated points of reference.
(c) We speak of the height of the cloud even when the pole
which reaches the cloud has not been erected. By means of optical observations of the cloud from different positions on the
ground, and taking into account the properties of the propagation of light, we determine the length of the pole we should
have required in order to reach the cloud.
From this consideration we see that it will be advantageous
if, in the description of position, it should be possible by means
of numerical measures to make ourselves independent of the
existence of marked positions (possessing names) on the rigid
3

It is not necessary here to investigate further the signiﬁcance of the expression
“coincidence in space.” This conception is sufﬁciently obvious to ensure that
differences of opinion are scarcely likely to arise as to its applicability in practice.

12

r e l at i v i t y

body of reference. In the physics of measurement this is attained
by the application of the Cartesian system of co-ordinates.
This consists of three plane surfaces perpendicular to each
other and rigidly attached to a rigid body. Referred to a system
of co-ordinates, the scene of any event will be determined (for the
main part) by the speciﬁcation of the lengths of the three perpendiculars or co-ordinates (x, y, z) which can be dropped from the
scene of the event to those three plane surfaces. The lengths of
these three perpendiculars can be determined by a series of manipulations with rigid measuring-rods performed according to
the rules and methods laid down by Euclidean geometry.
In practice, the rigid surfaces which constitute the system of
co-ordinates are generally not available; furthermore, the magnitudes of the co-ordinates are not actually determined by constructions with rigid rods, but by indirect means. If the results
of physics and astronomy are to maintain their clearness, the
physical meaning of speciﬁcations of position must always be
sought in accordance with the above considerations.4
We thus obtain the following result: Every description of
events in space involves the use of a rigid body to which such
events have to be referred. The resulting relationship takes for
granted that the laws of Euclidean geometry hold for “distances,” the “distance” being represented physically by means
of the convention of two marks on a rigid body.

4

A reﬁnement and modiﬁcation of these views does not become necessary until
we come to deal with the general theory of relativity, treated in the second part
of this book.

Space and Time in Classical Mechanics

The purpose of mechanics is to describe how bodies change
their position in space with “time.” I should load my conscience with grave sins against the sacred spirit of lucidity were
I to formulate the aims of mechanics in this way, without serious reﬂection and detailed explanations. Let us proceed to disclose these sins.
It is not clear what is to be understood here by “position” and
“space.” I stand at the window of a railway carriage which is
travelling uniformly, and drop a stone on the embankment, without throwing it. Then, disregarding the inﬂuence of the air resistance, I see the stone descend in a straight line. A pedestrian who
observes the misdeed from the footpath notices that the stone
falls to earth in a parabolic curve. I now ask: Do the “positions”
traversed by the stone lie “in reality” on a straight line or on a
parabola? Moreover, what is meant here by motion “in space”?
From the considerations of the previous section the answer is
self-evident. In the ﬁrst place we entirely shun the vague word
“space,” of which, we must honestly acknowledge, we cannot
form the slightest conception, and we replace it by “motion relative to a practically rigid body of reference.” The positions relative to the body of reference (railway carriage or embankment)
have already been deﬁned in detail in the preceding section. If instead of “body of reference” we insert “system of co-ordinates,”
which is a useful idea for mathematical description, we are in a
position to say: The stone traverses a straight line relative to a
system of co-ordinates rigidly attached to the carriage, but relative to a system of co-ordinates rigidly attached to the ground
(embankment) it describes a parabola. With the aid of this exam-

14

r e l at i v i t y

ple it is clearly seen that there is no such thing as an independently existing trajectory (lit. “path-curve”1), but only a trajectory relative to a particular body of reference.
In order to have a complete description of the motion, we
must specify how the body alters its position with time; i.e. for
every point on the trajectory it must be stated at what time
the body is situated there. These data must be supplemented by
such a deﬁnition of time that, in virtue of this deﬁnition, these
time-values can be regarded essentially as magnitudes (results
of measurements) capable of observation. If we take our stand
on the ground of classical mechanics, we can satisfy this requirement for our illustration in the following manner. We imagine
two clocks of identical construction; the man at the railwaycarriage window is holding one of them, and the man on the
footpath the other. Each of the observers determines the position
on his own reference-body occupied by the stone at each tick of
the clock he is holding in his hand. In this connection we have
not taken account of the inaccuracy involved by the ﬁniteness of
the velocity of propagation of light. With this and with a second
difﬁculty prevailing here we shall have to deal in detail later.

That is, a curve along which the body moves.

The Galileian System of Co-ordinates

As is well known, the fundamental law of the mechanics of
Galilei-Newton, which is known as the law of inertia, can be
stated thus: A body removed sufﬁciently far from other bodies
continues in a state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight
line. This law not only says something about the motion of the
bodies, but it also indicates the reference-bodies or systems of
co-ordinates, permissible in mechanics, which can be used in
mechanical description. The visible ﬁxed stars are bodies for
which the law of inertia certainly holds to a high degree of approximation. Now if we use a system of co-ordinates which is
rigidly attached to the earth, then, relative to this system, every
ﬁxed star describes a circle of immense radius in the course of
an astronomical day, a result which is opposed to the statement
of the law of inertia. So that if we adhere to this law we must
refer these motions only to systems of co-ordinates relative to
which the ﬁxed stars do not move in a circle. A system of coordinates of which the state of motion is such that the law of
inertia holds relative to it is called a “Galileian system of coordinates.” The laws of the mechanics of Galilei-Newton can
be regarded as valid only for a Galileian system of co-ordinates.

The Principle of Relativity
(in the Restricted Sense)

In order to attain the greatest possible clearness, let us return to
our example of the railway carriage supposed to be travelling
uniformly. We call its motion a uniform translation (“uniform”
because it is of constant velocity and direction, “translation”
because although the carriage changes its position relative to
the embankment yet it does not rotate in so doing). Let us imagine a raven ﬂying through the air in such a manner that its motion, as observed from the embankment, is uniform and in
a straight line. If we were to observe the ﬂying raven from the
moving railway carriage, we should ﬁnd that the motion of the
raven would be one of different velocity and direction, but that
it would still be uniform and in a straight line. Expressed in an
abstract manner we may say: If a mass m is moving uniformly
in a straight line with respect to a co-ordinate system K, then it
will also be moving uniformly and in a straight line relative to a
second co-ordinate system K, provided that the latter is executing a uniform translatory motion with respect to K. In accordance with the discussion contained in the preceding section, it
follows that:
If K is a Galileian co-ordinate system, then every other coordinate system K is a Galileian one, when, in relation to K, it
is in a condition of uniform motion of translation. Relative to
K the mechanical laws of Galilei-Newton hold good exactly as
they do with respect to K.
We advance a step farther in our generalisation when we express the tenet thus: If, relative to K, K is a uniformly moving
co-ordinate system devoid of rotation, then natural phenomena
run their course with respect to K according to exactly the same

t h e p r i n c i p l e o f r e l at i v i t y ( i n t h e r e s t r i c t e d s e n s e )

17

general laws as with respect to K. This statement is called the
principle of relativity (in the restricted sense).
As long as one was convinced that all natural phenomena were
capable of representation with the help of classical mechanics,
there was no need to doubt the validity of this principle of relativity. But in view of the more recent development of electrodynamics and optics it became more and more evident that classical
mechanics affords an insufﬁcient foundation for the physical description of all natural phenomena. At this juncture the question
of the validity of the principle of relativity became ripe for discussion, and it did not appear impossible that the answer to this
question might be in the negative.
Nevertheless, there are two general facts which at the outset
speak very much in favour of the validity of the principle of
relativity. Even though classical mechanics does not supply us
with a sufﬁciently broad basis for the theoretical presentation
of all physical phenomena, still we must grant it a considerable
measure of “truth,” since it supplies us with the actual motions
of the heavenly bodies with a delicacy of detail little short of
wonderful. The principle of relativity must therefore apply with
great accuracy in the domain of mechanics. But that a principle
of such broad generality should hold with such exactness in one
domain of phenomena, and yet should be invalid for another, is
a priori not very probable.
We now proceed to the second argument, to which, moreover, we shall return later. If the principle of relativity (in the
restricted sense) does not hold, then the Galileian co-ordinate
systems K, K, K, etc., which are moving uniformly relative to
each other, will not be equivalent for the description of natural
phenomena. In this case we should be constrained to believe
that natural laws are capable of being formulated in a particularly simple manner, and of course only on condition that, from
amongst all possible Galileian co-ordinate systems, we should
have chosen one (K0) of a particular state of motion as our body
of reference. We should then be justiﬁed (because of its merits
for the description of natural phenomena) in calling this system
“absolutely at rest,” and all other Galileian systems K “in motion.” If, for instance, our embankment were the system K0,

18

r e l at i v i t y

then our railway carriage would be a system K, relative to
which less simple laws would hold than with respect to K0. This
diminished simplicity would be due to the fact that the carriage K would be in motion (i.e. “really”) with respect to K0. In
the general laws of nature which have been formulated with reference to K, the magnitude and direction of the velocity of the
carriage would necessarily play a part. We should expect, for
instance, that the note emitted by an organ-pipe placed with its
axis parallel to the direction of travel would be different from
that emitted if the axis of the pipe were placed perpendicular to
this direction. Now in virtue of its motion in an orbit round the
sun, our earth is comparable with a railway carriage travelling
with a velocity of about 30 kilometres per second. If the principle of relativity were not valid we should therefore expect that
the direction of motion of the earth at any moment would enter
into the laws of nature, and also that physical systems in their
behaviour would be dependent on the orientation in space with
respect to the earth. For owing to the alteration in direction of
the velocity of revolution of the earth in the course of a year, the
earth cannot be at rest relative to the hypothetical system K0
throughout the whole year. However, the most careful observations have never revealed such anisotropic properties in terrestrial
physical space, i.e. a physical non-equivalence of different directions. This is a very powerful argument in favour of the principle
of relativity.

six
The Theorem of the Addition of Velocities
Employed in Classical Mechanics

Let us suppose our old friend the railway carriage to be travelling along the rails with a constant velocity v, and that a man
traverses the length of the carriage in the direction of travel
with a velocity w. How quickly or, in other words, with what velocity W does the man advance relative to the embankment during the process? The only possible answer seems to result from
the following consideration: If the man were to stand still for a
second, he would advance relative to the embankment through
a distance v equal numerically to the velocity of the carriage. As
a consequence of his walking, however, he traverses an additional distance w relative to the carriage, and hence also relative
to the embankment, in this second, the distance w being numerically equal to the velocity with which he is walking. Thus
in total he covers the distance W  v  w relative to the embankment in the second considered. We shall see later that this
result, which expresses the theorem of the addition of velocities
employed in classical mechanics, cannot be maintained; in
other words, the law that we have just written down does not
hold in reality. For the time being, however, we shall assume its
correctness.

seven
The Apparent Incompatibility
of the Law of Propagation of Light
with the Principle of Relativity

There is hardly a simpler law in physics than that according to
which light is propagated in empty space. Every child at school
knows, or believes he knows, that this propagation takes place
in straight lines with a velocity c  300,000 km./sec. At all events
we know with great exactness that this velocity is the same for
all colours, because if this were not the case, the minimum of
emission would not be observed simultaneously for different
colours during the eclipse of a ﬁxed star by its dark neighbour.
By means of similar considerations based on observations of
double stars, the Dutch astronomer De Sitter was also able to
show that the velocity of propagation of light cannot depend on
the velocity of motion of the body emitting the light. The assumption that this velocity of propagation is dependent on the
direction “in space” is in itself improbable.
In short, let us assume that the simple law of the constancy of
the velocity of light c (in vacuum) is justiﬁably believed by the
child at school. Who would imagine that this simple law has
plunged the conscientiously thoughtful physicist into the greatest intellectual difﬁculties? Let us consider how these difﬁculties arise.
Of course we must refer the process of the propagation of
light (and indeed every other process) to a rigid reference-body
(co-ordinate system). As such a system let us again choose our
embankment. We shall imagine the air above it to have been removed. If a ray of light be sent along the embankment, we see
from the above that the tip of the ray will be transmitted with
the velocity c relative to the embankment. Now let us suppose
that our railway carriage is again travelling along the railway

t h e p ro pag at i o n o f l i g h t

21

lines with the velocity v, and that its direction is the same as
that of the ray of light, but its velocity of course much less. Let
us inquire about the velocity of propagation of the ray of light
relative to the carriage. It is obvious that we can here apply the
consideration of the previous section, since the ray of light plays
the part of the man walking along relatively to the carriage. The
velocity W of the man relative to the embankment is here replaced by the velocity of light relative to the embankment. w is
the required velocity of light with respect to the carriage, and
we have
w  c  v.
The velocity of propagation of a ray of light relative to the carriage thus comes out smaller than c.
But this result comes into conﬂict with the principle of relativity set forth in Section 5. For, like every other general law of
nature, the law of the transmission of light in vacuo must, according to the principle of relativity, be the same for the railway
carriage as reference-body as when the rails are the body of reference. But, from our above consideration, this would appear to
be impossible. If every ray of light is propagated relative to the
embankment with the velocity c, then for this reason it would
appear that another law of propagation of light must necessarily hold with respect to the carriage—a result contradictory to
the principle of relativity.
In view of this dilemma there appears to be nothing else for it
than to abandon either the principle of relativity or the simple
law of the propagation of light in vacuo. Those of you who
have carefully followed the preceding discussion are almost
sure to expect that we should retain the principle of relativity,
which appeals so convincingly to the intellect because it is so
natural and simple. The law of the propagation of light in
vacuo would then have to be replaced by a more complicated
law comformable to the principle of relativity. The development
of theoretical physics shows, however, that we cannot pursue
this course. The epoch-making theoretical investigations of
H. A. Lorentz on the electrodynamical and optical phenomena

22

r e l at i v i t y

connected with moving bodies show that experience in this domain leads conclusively to a theory of electromagnetic phenomena, of which the law of the constancy of the velocity of light in
vacuo is a necessary consequence. Prominent theoretical physicists were therefore more inclined to reject the principle of relativity, in spite of the fact that no empirical data had been found
which were contradictory to this principle.
At this juncture the theory of relativity entered the arena. As
a result of an analysis of the physical conceptions of time and
space, it became evident that in reality there is not the least incompatibility between the principle of relativity and the law of
propagation of light, and that by systematically holding fast to
both these laws a logically rigid theory could be arrived at. This
theory has been called the special theory of relativity to distinguish it from the extended theory, with which we shall deal
later. In the following pages we shall present the fundamental
ideas of the special theory of relativity.

On the Idea of Time in Physics

Lightning has struck the rails on our railway embankment at
two places A and B far distant from each other. I make the additional assertion that these two lightning ﬂashes occurred simultaneously. If I ask you whether there is sense in this statement,
you will answer my question with a decided “Yes.” But if I now
approach you with the request to explain to me the sense of the
statement more precisely, you ﬁnd after some consideration that
the answer to this question is not so easy as it appears at ﬁrst
sight.
After some time perhaps the following answer would occur
to you: “The signiﬁcance of the statement is clear in itself and
needs no further explanation; of course it would require some
consideration if I were to be commissioned to determine by observations whether in the actual case the two events took place
simultaneously or not.” I cannot be satisﬁed with this answer
for the following reason. Supposing that as a result of ingenious
consideration an able meteorologist were to discover that the
lightning must always strike the places A and B simultaneously,
then we should be faced with the task of testing whether or not
this theoretical result is in accordance with the reality. We encounter the same difﬁculty with all physical statements in which
the conception “simultaneous” plays a part. The concept does
not exist for the physicist until he has the possibility of discovering whether or not it is fulﬁlled in an actual case. We thus require a deﬁnition of simultaneity such that this deﬁnition supplies
us with the method by means of which, in the present case, he
can decide by experiment whether or not both the lightning
strokes occurred simultaneously. As long as this requirement is

24

r e l at i v i t y

not satisﬁed, I allow myself to be deceived as a physicist (and of
course the same applies if I am not a physicist), when I imagine
that I am able to attach a meaning to the statement of simultaneity. (I would ask the reader not to proceed farther until he is
fully convinced on this point.)
After thinking the matter over for some time you then offer
the following suggestion with which to test simultaneity. By measuring along the rails, the connecting line AB should be measured
up and an observer placed at the mid-point M of the distance
AB. This observer should be supplied with an arrangement (e.g.
two mirrors inclined at 90°) which allows him visually to observe both places A and B at the same time. If the observer perceives the two ﬂashes of lightning at the same time, then they
are simultaneous.
I am very pleased with this suggestion, but for all that I cannot
regard the matter as quite settled, because I feel constrained to
raise the following objection: “Your deﬁnition would certainly
be right, if only I knew that the light by means of which the observer at M perceives the lightning ﬂashes travels along the length
A → M with the same velocity as along the length B → M. But an
examination of this supposition would only be possible if we already had at our disposal the means of measuring time. It would
thus appear as though we were moving here in a logical circle.”
After further consideration you cast a somewhat disdainful
glance at me—and rightly so—and you declare: “I maintain my
previous deﬁnition nevertheless, because in reality it assumes
absolutely nothing about light. There is only one demand to be
made of the deﬁnition of simultaneity, namely, that in every real
case it must supply us with an empirical decision as to whether
or not the conception that has to be deﬁned is fulﬁlled. That my
deﬁnition satisﬁes this demand is indisputable. That light requires the same time to traverse the path A → M as for the path
B → M is in reality neither a supposition nor a hypothesis
about the physical nature of light, but a stipulation which I can
make of my own freewill in order to arrive at a deﬁnition of simultaneity.”
It is clear that this deﬁnition can be used to give an exact
meaning not only to two events, but to as many events as we

o n t h e i d e a o f t i m e i n p h ys i c s

25

care to choose, and independently of the positions of the scenes
of the events with respect to the body of reference1 (here the
railway embankment). We are thus led also to a deﬁnition of
“time” in physics. For this purpose we suppose that clocks of
identical construction are placed at the points A, B and C of the
railway line (co-ordinate system), and that they are set in such a
manner that the positions of their pointers are simultaneously
(in the above sense) the same. Under these conditions we understand by the “time” of an event the reading (position of the
hands) of that one of these clocks which is in the immediate
vicinity (in space) of the event. In this manner a time-value is associated with every event which is essentially capable of observation.
This stipulation contains a further physical hypothesis, the
validity of which will hardly be doubted without empirical evidence to the contrary. It has been assumed that all these clocks
go at the same rate if they are of identical construction. Stated
more exactly: When two clocks arranged at rest in different
places of a reference-body are set in such a manner that a particular position of the pointers of the one clock is simultaneous
(in the above sense) with the same position of the pointers of
the other clock, then identical “settings” are always simultaneous (in the sense of the above deﬁnition).

1

We suppose further, that, when three events A, B and C occur in different
places in such a manner that A is simultaneous with B, and B is simultaneous
with C (simultaneous in the sense of the above deﬁnition), then the criterion for
the simultaneity of the pair of events A, C is also satisﬁed. This assumption is
a physical hypothesis about the law of propagation of light; it must certainly
be fulﬁlled if we are to maintain the law of the constancy of the velocity of
light in vacuo.

nine
The Relativity of Simultaneity

Up to now our considerations have been referred to a particular
body of reference, which we have styled a “railway embankment.” We suppose a very long train travelling along the rails
with the constant velocity v and in the direction indicated in
Fig. 1. People travelling in this train will with advantage use the
train as a rigid reference-body (co-ordinate system); they regard
all events in reference to the train. Then every event which takes
place along the line also takes place at a particular point of the
train. Also the deﬁnition of simultaneity can be given relative
to the train in exactly the same way as with respect to the embankment. As a natural consequence, however, the following
question arises:
Are two events (e.g. the two strokes of lightning A and B)
which are simultaneous with reference to the railway embankment also simultaneous relatively to the train? We shall show
directly that the answer must be in the negative.
When we say that the lightning strokes A and B are simultaneous with respect to the embankment, we mean: the rays of
light emitted at the places A and B, where the lightning occurs,
meet each other at the mid-point M of the length A → B of the

v

embankment. But the events A and B also correspond to positions A and B on the train. Let M be the mid-point of the distance A → B on the travelling train. Just when the ﬂashes1 of
lightning occur, this point M naturally coincides with the point
M, but it moves towards the right in the diagram with the velocity v of the train. If an observer sitting in the position M in
the train did not possess this velocity, then he would remain
permanently at M, and the light rays emitted by the ﬂashes of
lightning A and B would reach him simultaneously, i.e. they
would meet just where he is situated. Now in reality (considered with reference to the railway embankment) he is hastening
towards the beam of light coming from B, whilst he is riding
on ahead of the beam of light coming from A. Hence the observer will see the beam of light emitted from B earlier than he
will see that emitted from A. Observers who take the railway
train as their reference-body must therefore come to the conclusion that the lightning ﬂash B took place earlier than the lightning ﬂash A. We thus arrive at the important result:
Events which are simultaneous with reference to the embankment are not simultaneous with respect to the train, and vice
versa (relativity of simultaneity). Every reference-body (coordinate system) has its own particular time; unless we are told
the reference-body to which the statement of time refers, there
is no meaning in a statement of the time of an event.
Now before the advent of the theory of relativity it had
always tacitly been assumed in physics that the statement of
time had an absolute signiﬁcance, i.e. that it is independent
of the state of motion of the body of reference. But we have just
seen that this assumption is incompatible with the most natural
deﬁnition of simultaneity; if we discard this assumption, then
the conﬂict between the law of the propagation of light in
vacuo and the principle of relativity (developed in Section 7)
disappears.
We were led to that conﬂict by the considerations of Section 6,
which are now no longer tenable. In that section we concluded
that the man in the carriage, who traverses the distance w per
1

As judged from the embankment.

28

r e l at i v i t y

second relative to the carriage, traverses the same distance also
with respect to the embankment in each second of time. But, according to the foregoing considerations, the time required by a
particular occurrence with respect to the carriage must not be
considered equal to the duration of the same occurrence as judged
from the embankment (as reference-body). Hence it cannot be
contended that the man in walking travels the distance w relative
to the railway line in a time which is equal to one second as
judged from the embankment.
Moreover, the considerations of Section 6 are based on yet a
second assumption, which, in the light of a strict consideration,
appears to be arbitrary, although it was always tacitly made
even before the introduction of the theory of relativity.

ten
On the Relativity of the Conception
of Distance

Let us consider two particular points on the train1 travelling
along the embankment with the velocity v, and inquire as to
their distance apart. We already know that it is necessary to
have a body of reference for the measurement of a distance,
with respect to which body the distance can be measured up. It
is the simplest plan to use the train itself as reference-body (coordinate system). An observer in the train measures the interval
by marking off his measuring-rod in a straight line (e.g. along
the ﬂoor of the carriage) as many times as is necessary to take
him from the one marked point to the other. Then the number
which tells us how often the rod has to be laid down is the
required distance.
It is a different matter when the distance has to be judged
from the railway line. Here the following method suggests itself. If we call A and B the two points on the train whose distance apart is required, then both of these points are moving
with the velocity v along the embankment. In the ﬁrst place we
require to determine the points A and B of the embankment
which are just being passed by the two points A and B at a
particular time t—judged from the embankment. These points
A and B of the embankment can be determined by applying the
deﬁnition of time given in Section 8. The distance between these
points A and B is then measured by repeated application of
the measuring-rod along the embankment.
A priori it is by no means certain that this last measurement
will supply us with the same result as the ﬁrst. Thus the length
1

E.g. the middle of the ﬁrst and of the twentieth carriage.

30

r e l at i v i t y

of the train as measured from the embankment may be different
from that obtained by measuring in the train itself. This circumstance leads us to a second objection which must be raised
against the apparently obvious consideration of Section 6.
Namely, if the man in the carriage covers the distance w in a unit
of time—measured from the train—then this distance—as measured from the embankment—is not necessarily also equal to w.

eleven
The Lorentz Transformation

The results of the last three sections show that the apparent
incompatibility of the law of propagation of light with the
principle of relativity (Section 7) has been derived by means of
a consideration which borrowed two unjustiﬁable hypotheses
from classical mechanics; these are as follows:
(1) The time-interval (time) between two events is independent of
the condition of motion of the body of reference.
(2) The space-interval (distance) between two points of a rigid
body is independent of the condition of motion of the body of
reference.

If we drop these hypotheses, then the dilemma of Section 7
disappears, because the theorem of the addition of velocities
derived in Section 6 becomes invalid. The possibility presents
itself that the law of the propagation of light in vacuo may be
compatible with the principle of relativity, and the question
arises: How have we to modify the considerations of Section 6
in order to remove the apparent disagreement between these
two fundamental results of experience? This question leads to a
general one. In the discussion of Section 6 we have to do with
places and times relative both to the train and to the embankment. How are we to ﬁnd the place and time of an event in relation to the train, when we know the place and time of the
event with respect to the railway embankment? Is there a thinkable answer to this question of such a nature that the law of
transmission of light in vacuo does not contradict the principle
of relativity? In other words: Can we conceive of a relation

32

r e l at i v i t y

between place and time of the individual events relative to both
reference-bodies, such that every ray of light possesses the velocity of transmission c relative to the embankment and relative
to the train? This question leads to a quite deﬁnite positive answer, and to a perfectly deﬁnite transformation law for the
space-time magnitudes of an event when changing over from
one body of reference to another.
Before we deal with this, we shall introduce the following incidental consideration. Up to the present we have only considered events taking place along the embankment, which had
mathematically to assume the function of a straight line. In the
manner indicated in Section 2 we can imagine this referencebody supplemented laterally and in a vertical direction by means
of a framework of rods, so that an event which takes place anywhere can be localised with reference to this framework. Similarly, we can imagine the train travelling with the velocity v to
be continued across the whole of space, so that every event, no
matter how far off it may be, could also be localised with respect to the second framework. Without committing any fundamental error, we can disregard the fact that in reality these
frameworks would continually interfere with each other, owing
to the impenetrability of solid bodies. In every such framework
we imagine three surfaces perpendicular to each other marked
out, and designated as “co-ordinate planes” (“co-ordinate system”). A co-ordinate system K then corresponds to the embankment, and a co-ordinate system K to the train. An event,
wherever it may have taken place, would be ﬁxed in space with
respect to K by the three perpendiculars x, y, z on the coordinate planes, and with regard to time by a time-value t. Relative to K, the same event would be ﬁxed in respect of space and
time by corresponding values x, y, z, t, which of course are
not identical with x, y, z, t. It has already been set forth in detail how these magnitudes are to be regarded as results of physical measurements.
Obviously our problem can be exactly formulated in the following manner. What are the values x, y, z, t, of an event with
respect to K, when the magnitudes x, y, z, t, of the same event
with respect to K are given? The relations must be so chosen

that the law of the transmission of light in vacuo is satisﬁed for
one and the same ray of light (and of course for every ray) with
respect to K and K. For the relative orientation in space of the

This system of equations is known as the “Lorentz transformation.”1

This system of equations is often termed the “Galilei transformation.” The Galilei transformation can be obtained from the
Lorentz transformation by substituting an inﬁnitely large value
for the velocity of light c in the latter transformation.
Aided by the following illustration, we can readily see that,
in accordance with the Lorentz transformation, the law of the
transmission of light in vacuo is satisﬁed both for the referencebody K and for the reference-body K. A light-signal is sent
along the positive x-axis, and this light-stimulus advances in accordance with the equation
x  ct,
i.e. with the velocity c. According to the equations of the
Lorentz transformation, this simple relation between x and t involves a relation between x and t. In point of fact, if we substitute for x the value ct in the ﬁrst and fourth equations of the
Lorentz transformation, we obtain:

immediately follows. If referred to the system K, the propagation of light takes place according to this equation. We thus see
that the velocity of transmission relative to the reference-body
K is also equal to c. The same result is obtained for rays of
light advancing in any other direction whatsoever. Of course
this is not surprising, since the equations of the Lorentz transformation were derived conformably to this point of view.

The Behaviour of Measuring-Rods
and Clocks in Motion

I place a metre-rod in the x-axis of K in such a manner that one
end (the beginning) coincides with the point x  0, whilst the
other end (the end of the rod) coincides with the point x  1.
What is the length of the metre-rod relatively to the system K?
In order to learn this, we need only ask where the beginning of
the rod and the end of the rod lie with respect to K at a particular time t of the system K. By means of the ﬁrst equation of the
Lorentz transformation the values of these two points at the
time t  0 can be shown to be

that the length of a rigid metre-rod moving in the direction of

rod is thus shorter when in motion than when at rest, and the
more quickly it is moving, the shorter is the rod. For the velocity v  c we should have ��

velocities the square-root becomes imaginary. From this we conclude that in the theory of relativity the velocity c plays the part
of a limiting velocity, which can neither be reached nor exceeded
by any real body.

Of course this feature of the velocity c as a limiting velocity
also clearly follows from the equations of the Lorentz transformation, for these become meaningless if we choose values of
v greater than c.
If, on the contrary, we had considered a metre-rod at rest in
the x-axis with respect to K, then we should have found that the

this is quite in accordance with the principle of relativity which
forms the basis of our considerations.
A priori it is quite clear that we must be able to learn something about the physical behaviour of measuring-rods and
clocks from the equations of transformation, for the magnitudes x, y, z, t, are nothing more nor less than the results of measurements obtainable by means of measuring-rods and clocks. If
we had based our considerations on the Galileian transformation we should not have obtained a contraction of the rod as a
consequence of its motion.
Let us now consider a seconds-clock which is permanently
situated at the origin (x 0) of K. t 0 and t 1 are two
successive ticks of this clock. The ﬁrst and fourth equations of
the Lorentz transformation give for these two ticks:

Theorem of the Addition of the Velocities.
The Experiment of Fizeau

Now in practice we can move clocks and measuring-rods only
with velocities that are small compared with the velocity of
light; hence we shall hardly be able to compare the results of
the previous section directly with the reality. But, on the other
hand, these results must strike you as being very singular, and
for that reason I shall now draw another conclusion from the
theory, one which can easily be derived from the foregoing considerations, and which has been most elegantly conﬁrmed by
experiment.
In Section 6 we derived the theorem of the addition of velocities in one direction in the form which also results from the
hypotheses of classical mechanics. This theorem can also be deduced readily from the Galilei transformation (Section 11). In
place of the man walking inside the carriage, we introduce a
point moving relatively to the co-ordinate system K in accordance with the equation
x  wt.
By means of the ﬁrst and fourth equations of the Galilei transformation we can express x and t in terms of x and t, and we
then obtain
x  (v  w)t.
This equation expresses nothing else than the law of motion
of the point with reference to the system K (of the man with

theorem of the addition of the velocities

reference to the embankment). We denote this velocity by the
symbol W, and we then obtain, as in Section 6,
Wvw

.

(A).

But we can carry out this consideration just as well on the
basis of the theory of relativity. In the equation
x  wt
we must then express x and t in terms of x and t, making use
of the ﬁrst and fourth equations of the Lorentz transformation.
Instead of the equation (A) we then obtain the equation
vw
W 

(B),

which corresponds to the theorem of addition for velocities in
one direction according to the theory of relativity. The question
now arises as to which of these two theorems is the better in accord with experience. On this point we are enlightened by a
most important experiment which the brilliant physicist Fizeau
performed more than half a century ago, and which has been
repeated since then by some of the best experimental physicists,
so that there can be no doubt about its result. The experiment is
concerned with the following question. Light travels in a motionless liquid with a particular velocity w. How quickly does
it travel in the direction of the arrow in the tube T (see the accompanying diagram, Fig. 3) when the liquid above mentioned
is ﬂowing through the tube with a velocity v?

T
	
Fig. 3

40

r e l at i v i t y

In accordance with the principle of relativity we shall certainly
have to take for granted that the propagation of light always
takes place with the same velocity w with respect to the liquid,
whether the latter is in motion with reference to other bodies or
not. The velocity of light relative to the liquid and the velocity of
the latter relative to the tube are thus known, and we require the
velocity of light relative to the tube.
It is clear that we have the problem of Section 6 again before
us. The tube plays the part of the railway embankment or of the
co-ordinate system K, the liquid plays the part of the carriage or
of the co-ordinate system K, and ﬁnally, the light plays the
part of the man walking along the carriage, or of the moving
point in the present section. If we denote the velocity of the
light relative to the tube by W, then this is given by the equation
(A) or (B), according as the Galilei transformation or the Lorentz
transformation corresponds to the facts. Experiment1 decides in
favour of equation (B) derived from the theory of relativity, and
the agreement is, indeed, very exact. According to recent and
most excellent measurements by Zee-man, the inﬂuence of the
velocity of ﬂow v on the propagation of light is represented by
formula (B) to within one per cent.
Nevertheless we must now draw attention to the fact that a
theory of this phenomenon was given by H. A. Lorentz long
before the statement of the theory of relativity. This theory was
of a purely electrodynamical nature, and was obtained by the
use of particular hypotheses as to the electromagnetic structure
of matter. This circumstance, however, does not in the least diminish the conclusiveness of the experiment as a crucial test
in favour of the theory of relativity, for the electrodynamics of
Maxwell-Lorentz, on which the original theory was based, in

no way opposes the theory of relativity. Rather has the latter
been developed from electrodynamics as an astoundingly simple combination of generalisation of the hypotheses, formerly
independent of each other, on which electrodynamics was
built.

f o u rt e e n
The Heuristic Value of the
Theory of Relativity

Our train of thought in the foregoing pages can be epitomised
in the following manner. Experience has led to the conviction
that, on the one hand, the principle of relativity holds true and
that on the other hand the velocity of transmission of light
in vacuo has to be considered equal to a constant c. By uniting
these two postulates we obtained the law of transformation for
the rectangular co-ordinates x, y, z and the time t of the events
which constitute the processes of nature. In this connection we
did not obtain the Galilei transformation, but, differing from
classical mechanics, the Lorentz transformation.
The law of transmission of light, the acceptance of which is
justiﬁed by our actual knowledge, played an important part
in this process of thought. Once in possession of the Lorentz
transformation, however, we can combine this with the principle of relativity, and sum up the theory thus:
Every general law of nature must be so constituted that it is
transformed into a law of exactly the same form when, instead of the space-time variables x, y, z, t of the original coordinate system K, we introduce new space-time variables
x, y, z, t of a co-ordinate system K. In this connection the
relation between the ordinary and the accented magnitudes is
given by the Lorentz transformation. Or in brief: General laws
of nature are co-variant with respect to Lorentz transformations.
This is a deﬁnite mathematical condition that the theory of
relativity demands of a natural law, and in virtue of this, the
theory becomes a valuable heuristic aid in the search for general

t h e h e u r i s t i c va l u e o f t h e t h e o ry o f r e l at i v i t y

43

laws of nature. If a general law of nature were to be found
which did not satisfy this condition, then at least one of the two
fundamental assumptions of the theory would have been disproved. Let us now examine what general results the latter theory has hitherto evinced.

fifteen
General Results of the Theory

It is clear from our previous considerations that the (special) theory of relativity has grown out of electrodynamics and optics. In
these ﬁelds it has not appreciably altered the predictions of theory, but it has considerably simpliﬁed the theoretical structure,
i.e. the derivation of laws, and—what is incomparably more
important—it has considerably reduced the number of independent hypotheses forming the basis of theory. The special theory
of relativity has rendered the Maxwell-Lorentz theory so plausible, that the latter would have been generally accepted by physicists even if experiment had decided less unequivocally in its
favour.
Classical mechanics required to be modiﬁed before it could
come into line with the demands of the special theory of relativity. For the main part, however, this modiﬁcation affects
only the laws for rapid motions, in which the velocities of matter v are not very small as compared with the velocity of light.
We have experience of such rapid motions only in the case of
electrons and ions; for other motions the variations from the
laws of classical mechanics are too small to make themselves
evident in practice. We shall not consider the motion of stars
until we come to speak of the general theory of relativity. In
accordance with the theory of relativity the kinetic energy of a
material point of mass m is no longer given by the well-known
expression

This expression approaches inﬁnity as the velocity v approaches
the velocity of light c. The velocity must therefore always remain less than c, however great may be the energies used to produce the acceleration. If we develop the expression for the kinetic
energy in the form of a series, we obtain

v2 is small compared with unity, the third of these

terms is always small in comparison with the second, which last
is alone considered in classical mechanics. The ﬁrst term mc2
does not contain the velocity, and requires no consideration if
we are only dealing with the question as to how the energy of a
point-mass depends on the velocity. We shall speak of its essential signiﬁcance later.
The most important result of a general character to which
the special theory of relativity has led is concerned with the
conception of mass. Before the advent of relativity, physics
recognised two conservation laws of fundamental importance,
namely, the law of the conservation of energy and the law of
the conservation of mass; these two fundamental laws appeared to be quite independent of each other. By means of the
theory of relativity they have been united into one law. We shall
now brieﬂy consider how this uniﬁcation came about, and what
meaning is to be attached to it.
The principle of relativity requires that the law of the conservation of energy should hold not only with reference to a coordinate system K, but also with respect to every co-ordinate
system K which is in a state of uniform motion of translation
relative to K, or, brieﬂy, relative to every “Galileian” system of

46

r e l at i v i t y

co-ordinates. In contrast to classical mechanics, the Lorentz
transformation is the deciding factor in the transition from one
such system to another.
By means of comparatively simple considerations we are led
to draw the following conclusion from these premises, in conjunction with the fundamental equations of the electrodynamics of Maxwell: A body moving with the velocity v, which
absorbs1 an amount of energy E0 in the form of radiation without suffering an alteration in velocity in the process, has, as
a consequence, its energy increased by an amount

Thus the body has the same energy as a body of mass

body takes up an amount of energy E0, then its inertial mass

; the inertial mass of a body is not
increases by an amount 

a constant, but varies according to the change in the energy of
the body. The inertial mass of a system of bodies can even be regarded as a measure of its energy. The law of the conservation
of the mass of a system becomes identical with the law of the
conservation of energy, and is only valid provided that the

the body.

system neither takes up nor sends out energy. Writing the expression for the energy in the form

0 ,
v2

we see that the term mc2, which has hitherto attracted our attention, is nothing else than the energy possessed by the body2
before it absorbed the energy E0.
A direct comparison of this relation with experiment is not
possible at the present time (1920), owing to the fact that the
changes in energy E0 to which we can subject a system are not
large enough to make themselves perceptible as a change in the
E0
inertial mass of the system. 
is too small in comparison with
c2
the mass m, which was present before the alteration of the energy. It is owing to this circumstance that classical mechanics was
able to establish successfully the conservation of mass as a law of
independent validity.
Let me add a ﬁnal remark of a fundamental nature. The success of the Faraday-Maxwell interpretation of electromagnetic
action at a distance resulted in physicists becoming convinced
that there are no such things as instantaneous actions at a distance (not involving an intermediary medium) of the type of
Newton’s law of gravitation. According to the theory of relativity, action at a distance with the velocity of light always takes
the place of instantaneous action at a distance or of action at
a distance with an inﬁnite velocity of transmission. This is connected with the fact that the velocity c plays a fundamental rôle
in this theory. In Part II we shall see in what way this result becomes modiﬁed in the general theory of relativity.

Experience and the Special Theory
of Relativity

To what extent is the special theory of relativity supported by
experience? This question is not easily answered for the reason
already mentioned in connection with the fundamental experiment of Fizeau. The special theory of relativity has crystallised
out from the Maxwell-Lorentz theory of electromagnetic phenomena. Thus all facts of experience which support the electromagnetic theory also support the theory of relativity. As being
of particular importance, I mention here the fact that the theory
of relativity enables us to predict the effects produced on the
light reaching us from the ﬁxed stars. These results are obtained in an exceedingly simple manner, and the effects indicated, which are due to the relative motion of the earth with
reference to those ﬁxed stars, are found to be in accord with experience. We refer to the yearly movement of the apparent position of the ﬁxed stars resulting from the motion of the earth
round the sun (aberration), and to the inﬂuence of the radial
components of the relative motions of the ﬁxed stars with respect to the earth on the colour of the light reaching us from
them. The latter effect manifests itself in a slight displacement
of the spectral lines of the light transmitted to us from a ﬁxed star,
as compared with the position of the same spectral lines when
they are produced by a terrestrial source of light (Doppler principle). The experimental arguments in favour of the MaxwellLorentz theory, which are at the same time arguments in favour of
the theory of relativity, are too numerous to be set forth here. In
reality they limit the theoretical possibilities to such an extent,
that no other theory than that of Maxwell and Lorentz has been
able to hold its own when tested by experience.

e x p e r i e n c e a n d t h e s p e c i a l t h e o ry o f r e l at i v i t y

49

But there are two classes of experimental facts hitherto obtained which can be represented in the Maxwell-Lorentz theory
only by the introduction of an auxiliary hypothesis, which in
itself—i.e. without making use of the theory of relativity—
appears extraneous.
It is known that cathode rays and the so-called -rays emitted
by radioactive substances consist of negatively electriﬁed particles (electrons) of very small inertia and large velocity. By examining the deﬂection of these rays under the inﬂuence of
electric and magnetic ﬁelds, we can study the law of motion of
these particles very exactly.
In the theoretical treatment of these electrons, we are faced
with the difﬁculty that electrodynamic theory of itself is unable
to give an account of their nature. For since electrical masses of
one sign repel each other, the negative electrical masses constituting the electron would necessarily be scattered under the
inﬂuence of their mutual repulsions, unless there are forces of
another kind operating between them, the nature of which has
hitherto remained obscure to us.1 If we now assume that the
relative distances between the electrical masses constituting the
electron remain unchanged during the motion of the electron
(rigid connection in the sense of classical mechanics), we arrive at a law of motion of the electron which does not agree
with experience. Guided by purely formal points of view,
H. A. Lorentz was the ﬁrst to introduce the hypothesis that the
form of the electron experiences a contraction in the direction
of motion in consequence of that motion, the contracted length
v2 . This hypothesis,
being proportional to the expression 1  
c2
which is not justiﬁable by any electrodynamical facts, supplies
us then with that particular law of motion which has been conﬁrmed with great precision in recent years.
The theory of relativity leads to the same law of motion,
without requiring any special hypothesis whatsoever as to the
structure and the behaviour of the electron. We arrived at a

��

The general theory of relativity renders it likely that the electrical masses of an
electron are held together by gravitational forces.

50

r e l at i v i t y

similar conclusion of Section 13 in connection with the experiment of Fizeau, the result of which is foretold by the theory of
relativity without the necessity of drawing on hypotheses as to
the physical nature of the liquid.
The second class of facts to which we have alluded has reference to the question whether or not the motion of the earth
in space can be made perceptible in terrestrial experiments.
We have already remarked in Section 5 that all attempts of this
nature led to a negative result. Before the theory of relativity
was put forward, it was difﬁcult to become reconciled to this
negative result, for reasons now to be discussed. The inherited
prejudices about time and space did not allow any doubt to
arise as to the prime importance of the Galileian transformation for changing over from one body of reference to another.
Now assuming that the Maxwell-Lorentz equations hold for
a reference-body K, we then ﬁnd that they do not hold for a
reference-body K moving uniformly with respect to K, if we assume that the relations of the Galileian transformation exist between the co-ordinates of K and K. It thus appears that, of all
Galileian co-ordinate systems, one (K) corresponding to a particular state of motion is physically unique. This result was interpreted physically by regarding K as at rest with respect to a
hypothetical æther of space. On the other hand, all co-ordinate
systems K moving relatively to K were to be regarded as in motion with respect to the æther. To this motion of K against the
æther (“æther-drift” relative to K) were attributed the more
complicated laws which were supposed to hold relative to K.
Strictly speaking, such an æther-drift ought also to be assumed
relative to the earth, and for a long time the efforts of physicists
were devoted to attempts to detect the existence of an ætherdrift at the earth’s surface.
In one of the most notable of these attempts Michelson devised
a method which appears as though it must be decisive. Imagine
two mirrors so arranged on a rigid body that the reﬂecting surfaces face each other. A ray of light requires a perfectly deﬁnite
time T to pass from one mirror to the other and back again, if the
whole system be at rest with respect to the æther. It is found by
calculation, however, that a slightly different time T is required

e x p e r i e n c e a n d t h e s p e c i a l t h e o ry o f r e l at i v i t y

51

for this process, if the body, together with the mirrors, be moving
relatively to the æther. And yet another point: it is shown by calculation that for a given velocity v with reference to the æther,
this time T is different when the body is moving perpendicularly
to the planes of the mirrors from that resulting when the motion
is parallel to these planes. Although the estimated difference between these two times is exceedingly small, Michelson and Morley performed an experiment involving interference in which this
difference should have been clearly detectable. But the experiment gave a negative result—a fact very perplexing to physicists.
Lorentz and FitzGerald rescued the theory from this difﬁculty by
assuming that the motion of the body relative to the æther produces a contraction of the body in the direction of motion, the
amount of contraction being just sufﬁcient to compensate for the
difference in time mentioned above. Comparison with the discussion in Section 12 shows that also from the standpoint of the
theory of relativity this solution of the difﬁculty was the right
one. But on the basis of the theory of relativity the method of interpretation is incomparably more satisfactory. According to this
theory there is no such thing as a “specially favoured” (unique)
co-ordinate system to occasion the introduction of the ætheridea, and hence there can be no æther-drift, nor any experiment
with which to demonstrate it. Here the contraction of moving
bodies follows from the two fundamental principles of the theory, without the introduction of particular hypotheses; and as the
prime factor involved in this contraction we ﬁnd, not the motion
in itself, to which we cannot attach any meaning, but the motion
with respect to the body of reference chosen in the particular case
in point. Thus for a co-ordinate system moving with the earth
the mirror system of Michelson and Morley is not shortened, but
it is shortened for a co-ordinate system which is at rest relatively
to the sun.

seventeen
Minkowski’s Four-Dimensional Space

The non-mathematician is seized by a mysterious shuddering
when he hears of “four-dimensional” things, by a feeling not
unlike that awakened by thoughts of the occult. And yet there is
no more common-place statement than that the world in which
we live is a four-dimensional space-time continuum.
Space is a three-dimensional continuum. By this we mean
that it is possible to describe the position of a point (at rest) by
means of three numbers (co-ordinates) x, y, z, and that there is
an indeﬁnite number of points in the neighbourhood of this one,
the position of which can be described by co-ordinates such as
x1, y1, z1, which may be as near as we choose to the respective
values of the co-ordinates x, y, z of the ﬁrst point. In virtue of
the latter property we speak of a “continuum,” and owing to
the fact that there are three co-ordinates we speak of it as being
“three-dimensional.”
Similarly, the world of physical phenomena which was brieﬂy
called “world” by Minkowski is naturally four-dimensional in
the space-time sense. For it is composed of individual events,
each of which is described by four numbers, namely, three space
co-ordinates x, y, z and a time co-ordinate, the time-value t. The
“world” is in this sense also a continuum; for to every event there
are as many “neighbouring” events (realised or at least thinkable)
as we care to choose, the co-ordinates x1, y1, z1, t1 of which differ
by an indeﬁnitely small amount from those of the event x, y, z, t
originally considered. That we have not been accustomed to regard the world in this sense as a four-dimensional continuum is
due to the fact that in physics, before the advent of the theory of
relativity, time played a different and more independent rôle, as

m i n kow s k i ’ s f o u r- d i m e n s i o n a l s pac e

53

compared with the space co-ordinates. It is for this reason that
we have been in the habit of treating time as an independent
continuum. As a matter of fact, according to classical mechanics, time is absolute, i.e. it is independent of the position and the
condition of motion of the system of co-ordinates. We see this
expressed in the last equation of the Galileian transformation
(t  t).
The four-dimensional mode of consideration of the “world”
is natural on the theory of relativity, since according to this theory time is robbed of its independence. This is shown by the
fourth equation of the Lorentz transformation:
v
t  2 x
c
t  .
v2
1  
c2

��

Moreover, according to this equation the time difference t of
two events with respect to K does not in general vanish, even
when the time difference t of the same events with reference to
K vanishes. Pure “space-distance” of two events with respect
to K results in “time-distance” of the same events with respect to K. But the discovery of Minkowski, which was of importance for the formal development of the theory of relativity,
does not lie here. It is to be found rather in the fact of his recognition that the four-dimensional space-time continuum of the
theory of relativity, in its most essential formal properties,
shows a pronounced relationship to the three-dimensional continuum of Euclidean geometrical space.1 In order to give due
prominence to this relationship, however, we must replace the
usual time co-ordinate t by an imaginary magnitude �1
� . ct
proportional to it. Under these conditions, the natural laws satisfying the demands of the (special) theory of relativity assume
mathematical forms, in which the time co-ordinate plays exactly the same rôle as the three space co-ordinates. Formally,
these four co-ordinates correspond exactly to the three space
1

Cf. the somewhat more detailed discussion in Appendix 2.

54

r e l at i v i t y

co-ordinates in Euclidean geometry. It must be clear even to the
non-mathematician that, as a consequence of this purely formal
addition to our knowledge, the theory perforce gained clearness
in no mean measure.
These inadequate remarks can give the reader only a vague
notion of the important idea contributed by Minkowski. Without it the general theory of relativity, of which the fundamental
ideas are developed in the following pages, would perhaps have
got no farther than its long clothes. Minkowski’s work is doubtless difﬁcult of access to anyone inexperienced in mathematics,
but since it is not necessary to have a very exact grasp of this
work in order to understand the fundamental ideas of either the
special or the general theory of relativity, I shall leave it here at
present, and revert to it only towards the end of Part II.

Special and General
Principle of Relativity

The basal principle, which was the pivot of all our previous
considerations, was the special principle of relativity, i.e. the
principle of the physical relativity of all uniform motion. Let us
once more analyse its meaning carefully.
It was at all times clear that, from the point of view of the
idea it conveys to us, every motion must be considered only as
a relative motion. Returning to the illustration we have frequently used of the embankment and the railway carriage, we
can express the fact of the motion here taking place in the following two forms, both of which are equally justiﬁable:
(a) The carriage is in motion relative to the embankment.
(b) The embankment is in motion relative to the carriage.
In (a) the embankment, in (b) the carriage, serves as the body
of reference in our statement of the motion taking place. If it is
simply a question of detecting or of describing the motion involved, it is in principle immaterial to what reference-body we
refer the motion. As already mentioned, this is self-evident, but
it must not be confused with the much more comprehensive
statement called “the principle of relativity,” which we have
taken as the basis of our investigations.
The principle we have made use of not only maintains that
we may equally well choose the carriage or the embankment as
our reference-body for the description of any event (for this,
too, is self-evident). Our principle rather asserts what follows: If
we formulate the general laws of nature as they are obtained
from experience, by making use of
(a) the embankment as reference-body,
(b) the railway carriage as reference-body,

58

r e l at i v i t y

then these general laws of nature (e.g. the laws of mechanics or
the law of the propagation of light in vacuo) have exactly the
same form in both cases. This can also be expressed as follows:
For the physical description of natural processes, neither of the
reference-bodies K, K is unique (lit. “specially marked out”) as
compared with the other. Unlike the ﬁrst, this latter statement
need not of necessity hold a priori; it is not contained in the
conceptions of “motion” and “reference-body” and derivable
from them; only experience can decide as to its correctness or
incorrectness.
Up to the present, however, we have by no means maintained
the equivalence of all bodies of reference K in connection with
the formulation of natural laws. Our course was more on the
following lines. In the ﬁrst place, we started out from the assumption that there exists a reference-body K, whose condition
of motion is such that the Galileian law holds with respect to it:
A particle left to itself and sufﬁciently far removed from all
other particles moves uniformly in a straight line. With reference to K (Galileian reference-body) the laws of nature were
to be as simple as possible. But in addition to K, all bodies of
reference K should be given preference in this sense, and they
should be exactly equivalent to K for the formulation of natural
laws, provided that they are in a state of uniform rectilinear and
non-rotary motion with respect to K; all these bodies of reference are to be regarded as Galileian reference-bodies. The validity of the principle of relativity was assumed only for these
reference-bodies, but not for others (e.g. those possessing motion of a different kind). In this sense we speak of the special
principle of relativity, or special theory of relativity.
In contrast to this we wish to understand by the “general
principle of relativity” the following statement: All bodies of
reference K, K, etc., are equivalent for the description of natural phenomena (formulation of the general laws of nature),
whatever may be their state of motion. But before proceeding
farther, it ought to be pointed out that this formulation must be
replaced later by a more abstract one, for reasons which will
become evident at a later stage.
Since the introduction of the special principle of relativity has

s p e c i a l a n d g e n e r a l p r i n c i p l e o f r e l at i v i t y

been justiﬁed, every intellect which strives after generalisation
must feel the temptation to venture the step towards the general
principle of relativity. But a simple and apparently quite reliable
consideration seems to suggest that, for the present at any rate,
there is little hope of success in such an attempt. Let us imagine
ourselves transferred to our old friend the railway carriage,
which is travelling at a uniform rate. As long as it is moving
uniformly, the occupant of the carriage is not sensible of its motion, and it is for this reason that he can without reluctance interpret the facts of the case as indicating that the carriage is at
rest, but the embankment in motion. Moreover, according to
the special principle of relativity, this interpretation is quite justiﬁed also from a physical point of view.
If the motion of the carriage is now changed into a nonuniform motion, as for instance by a powerful application of the
brakes, then the occupant of the carriage experiences a correspondingly powerful jerk forwards. The retarded motion is manifested in the mechanical behaviour of bodies relative to the
person in the railway carriage. The mechanical behaviour is different from that of the case previously considered, and for this
reason it would appear to be impossible that the same mechanical laws hold relatively to the non-uniformly moving carriage,
as hold with reference to the carriage when at rest or in uniform
motion. At all events it is clear that the Galileian law does not
hold with respect to the non-uniformly moving carriage. Because
of this, we feel compelled at the present juncture to grant a kind
of absolute physical reality to non-uniform motion, in opposition to the general principle of relativity. But in what follows we
shall soon see that this conclusion cannot be maintained.

The Gravitational Field

“If we pick up a stone and then let it go, why does it fall to the
ground?” The usual answer to this question is: “Because it is attracted by the earth.” Modern physics formulates the answer
rather differently for the following reason. As a result of the
more careful study of electromagnetic phenomena, we have
come to regard action at a distance as a process impossible without the intervention of some intermediary medium. If, for instance, a magnet attracts a piece of iron, we cannot be content to
regard this as meaning that the magnet acts directly on the iron
through the intermediate empty space, but we are constrained to
imagine—after the manner of Faraday—that the magnet always
calls into being something physically real in the space around it,
that something being what we call a “magnetic ﬁeld.” In its turn
this magnetic ﬁeld operates on the piece of iron, so that the latter
strives to move towards the magnet. We shall not discuss here the
justiﬁcation for this incidental conception, which is indeed a somewhat arbitrary one. We shall only mention that with its aid electromagnetic phenomena can be theoretically represented much
more satisfactorily than without it, and this applies particularly
to the transmission of electromagnetic waves. The effects of gravitation also are regarded in an analogous manner.
The action of the earth on the stone takes place indirectly.
The earth produces in its surroundings a gravitational ﬁeld,
which acts on the stone and produces its motion of fall. As we
know from experience, the intensity of the action on a body diminishes according to a quite deﬁnite law, as we proceed farther
and farther away from the earth. From our point of view this
means: The law governing the properties of the gravitational

t h e g r av i tat i o n a l f i e l d

61

ﬁeld in space must be a perfectly deﬁnite one, in order correctly to represent the diminution of gravitational action with
the distance from operative bodies. It is something like this: The
body (e.g. the earth) produces a ﬁeld in its immediate neighbourhood directly; the intensity and direction of the ﬁeld at
points farther removed from the body are thence determined by
the law which governs the properties in space of the gravitational ﬁelds themselves.
In contrast to electric and magnetic ﬁelds, the gravitational
ﬁeld exhibits a most remarkable property, which is of fundamental importance for what follows. Bodies which are moving
under the sole inﬂuence of a gravitational ﬁeld receive an acceleration, which does not in the least depend either on the material or on the physical state of the body. For instance, a piece of
lead and a piece of wood fall in exactly the same manner in a
gravitational ﬁeld (in vacuo), when they start off from rest or
with the same initial velocity. This law, which holds most accurately, can be expressed in a different form in the light of the
following consideration.
According to Newton’s law of motion, we have
(Force)  (inertial mass)  (acceleration),
where the “inertial mass” is a characteristic constant of the accelerated body. If now gravitation is the cause of the acceleration, we then have
(Force)  (gravitational mass)  (intensity of the
gravitational ﬁeld),
where the “gravitational mass” is likewise a characteristic constant for the body. From these two relations follows:
(gravitational mass)
(acceleration)   (intensity of the
(inertial mass) gravitational ﬁeld).
If now, as we ﬁnd from experience, the acceleration is to be
independent of the nature and the condition of the body and

62

r e l at i v i t y

always the same for a given gravitational ﬁeld, then the ratio of
the gravitational to the inertial mass must likewise be the same
for all bodies. By a suitable choice of units we can thus make this
ratio equal to unity. We then have the following law: The gravitational mass of a body is equal to its inertial mass.
It is true that this important law had hitherto been recorded
in mechanics, but it had not been interpreted. A satisfactory interpretation can be obtained only if we recognise the following
fact: The same quality of a body manifests itself according to
circumstances as “inertia” or as “weight” (lit. “heaviness”). In
the following section we shall show to what extent this is actually the case, and how this question is connected with the general postulate of relativity.

twenty
The Equality of Inertial and Gravitational
Mass as an Argument for the General
Postulate of Relativity

We imagine a large portion of empty space, so far removed
from stars and other appreciable masses, that we have before us
approximately the conditions required by the fundamental law
of Galilei. It is then possible to choose a Galileian referencebody for this part of space (world), relative to which points at
rest remain at rest and points in motion continue permanently
in uniform rectilinear motion. As reference-body let us imagine
a spacious chest resembling a room with an observer inside
who is equipped with apparatus. Gravitation naturally does not
exist for this observer. He must fasten himself with strings to
the ﬂoor, otherwise the slightest impact against the ﬂoor will
cause him to rise slowly towards the ceiling of the room.
To the middle of the lid of the chest is ﬁxed externally a hook
with rope attached, and now a “being” (what kind of a being is
immaterial to us) begins pulling at this with a constant force.
The chest together with the observer then begins to move “upwards” with a uniformly accelerated motion. In course of time
their velocity will reach unheard-of values—provided that we
are viewing all this from another reference-body which is not
being pulled with a rope.
But how does the man in the chest regard the process? The
acceleration of the chest will be transmitted to him by the reaction of the ﬂoor of the chest. He must therefore take up this
pressure by means of his legs if he does not wish to be laid out
full length on the ﬂoor. He is then standing in the chest in exactly the same way as anyone stands in a room of a house on
our earth. If he releases a body which he previously had in his
hand, the acceleration of the chest will no longer be transmitted

64

r e l at i v i t y

to this body, and for this reason the body will approach the
ﬂoor of the chest with an accelerated relative motion. The observer will further convince himself that the acceleration of the
body towards the ﬂoor of the chest is always of the same magnitude, whatever kind of body he may happen to use for the
experiment.
Relying on his knowledge of the gravitational ﬁeld (as it was
discussed in the preceding section), the man in the chest will
thus come to the conclusion that he and the chest are in a gravitational ﬁeld which is constant with regard to time. Of course
he will be puzzled for a moment as to why the chest does not
fall in this gravitational ﬁeld. Just then, however, he discovers
the hook in the middle of the lid of the chest and the rope which
is attached to it, and he consequently comes to the conclusion
that the chest is suspended at rest in the gravitational ﬁeld.
Ought we to smile at the man and say that he errs in his conclusion? I do not believe we ought to if we wish to remain
consistent; we must rather admit that his mode of grasping the
situation violates neither reason nor known mechanical laws.
Even though it is being accelerated with respect to the “Galileian
space” ﬁrst considered, we can nevertheless regard the chest as
being at rest. We have thus good grounds for extending the principle of relativity to include bodies of reference which are accelerated with respect to each other, and as a result we have gained
a powerful argument for a generalised postulate of relativity.
We must note carefully that the possibility of this mode of interpretation rests on the fundamental property of the gravitational ﬁeld of giving all bodies the same acceleration, or, what
comes to the same thing, on the law of the equality of inertial
and gravitational mass. If this natural law did not exist, the man
in the accelerated chest would not be able to interpret the behaviour of the bodies around him on the supposition of a gravitational ﬁeld, and he would not be justiﬁed on the grounds of
experience in supposing his reference-body to be “at rest.”
Suppose that the man in the chest ﬁxes a rope to the inner
side of the lid, and that he attaches a body to the free end of the
rope. The result of this will be to stretch the rope so that it will
hang “vertically” downwards. If we ask for an opinion of the

i n e r t i a l a n d g r av i tat i o n a l m as s

65

cause of tension in the rope, the man in the chest will say: “The
suspended body experiences a downward force in the gravitational ﬁeld, and this is neutralised by the tension of the rope;
what determines the magnitude of the tension of the rope is the
gravitational mass of the suspended body.” On the other hand,
an observer who is poised freely in space will interpret the condition of things thus: “The rope must perforce take part in the
accelerated motion of the chest, and it transmits this motion to
the body attached to it. The tension of the rope is just large
enough to effect the acceleration of the body. That which determines the magnitude of the tension of the rope is the inertial
mass of the body.” Guided by this example, we see that our extension of the principle of relativity implies the necessity of the
law of the equality of inertial and gravitational mass. Thus we
have obtained a physical interpretation of this law.
From our consideration of the accelerated chest we see that
a general theory of relativity must yield important results on
the laws of gravitation. In point of fact, the systematic pursuit
of the general idea of relativity has supplied the laws satisﬁed by
the gravitational ﬁeld. Before proceeding farther, however, I
must warn the reader against a misconception suggested by these
considerations. A gravitational ﬁeld exists for the man in the
chest, despite the fact that there was no such ﬁeld for the coordinate system ﬁrst chosen. Now we might easily suppose that
the existence of a gravitational ﬁeld is always only an apparent
one. We might also think that, regardless of the kind of gravitational ﬁeld which may be present, we could always choose another reference-body such that no gravitational ﬁeld exists with
reference to it. This is by no means true for all gravitational
ﬁelds, but only for those of quite special form. It is, for instance, impossible to choose a body of reference such that, as
judged from it, the gravitational ﬁeld of the earth (in its entirety) vanishes.
We can now appreciate why that argument is not convincing,
which we brought forward against the general principle of relativity at the end of Section 18. It is certainly true that the observer in the railway carriage experiences a jerk forwards as
a result of the application of the brake, and that he recognises

66

r e l at i v i t y

in this the non-uniformity of motion (retardation) of the carriage. But he is compelled by nobody to refer this jerk to a
“real” acceleration (retardation) of the carriage. He might also
interpret his experience thus: “My body of reference (the carriage) remains permanently at rest. With reference to it, however, there exists (during the period of application of the brakes)
a gravitational ﬁeld which is directed forwards and which is
variable with respect to time. Under the inﬂuence of this ﬁeld,
the embankment together with the earth moves nonuniformly
in such a manner that their original velocity in the backwards
direction is continuously reduced.”

t w e n t y- o n e
In What Respects Are the Foundations
of Classical Mechanics and of the Special
Theory of Relativity Unsatisfactory?

We have already stated several times that classical mechanics
starts out from the following law: Material particles sufﬁciently
far removed from other material particles continue to move
uniformly in a straight line or continue in a state of rest. We
have also repeatedly emphasised that this fundamental law can
only be valid for bodies of reference K which possess certain
unique states of motion, and which are in uniform translational
motion relative to each other. Relative to other reference-bodies
K the law is not valid. Both in classical mechanics and in the
special theory of relativity we therefore differentiate between
reference-bodies K relative to which the recognised “laws of
nature” can be said to hold, and reference-bodies K relative to
which these laws do not hold.
But no person whose mode of thought is logical can rest satisﬁed with this condition of things. He asks: “How does it come
that certain reference-bodies (or their states of motion) are
given priority over other reference-bodies (or their states of motion)? What is the reason for this preference? In order to show
clearly what I mean by this question, I shall make use of a comparison.
I am standing in front of a gas range. Standing alongside of
each other on the range are two pans so much alike that one
may be mistaken for the other. Both are half full of water. I notice that steam is being emitted continuously from the one pan,
but not from the other. I am surprised at this, even if I have
never seen either a gas range or a pan before. But if I now notice
a luminous something of bluish colour under the ﬁrst pan but
not under the other, I cease to be astonished, even if I have never

68

r e l at i v i t y

before seen a gas ﬂame. For I can only say that this bluish something will cause the emission of the steam, or at least possibly it
may do so. If, however, I notice the bluish something in neither
case, and if I observe that the one continuously emits steam
whilst the other does not, then I shall remain astonished and
dissatisﬁed until I have discovered some circumstance to which
I can attribute the different behaviour of the two pans.
Analogously, I seek in vain for a real something in classical
mechanics (or in the special theory of relativity) to which I can
attribute the different behaviour of bodies considered with respect to the reference-systems K and K.1 Newton saw this objection and attempted to invalidate it, but without success. But
E. Mach recognised it most clearly of all, and because of this
objection he claimed that mechanics must be placed on a new
basis. It can only be got rid of by means of a physics which
is comformable to the general principle of relativity, since the
equations of such a theory hold for every body of reference,
whatever may be its state of motion.

1

The objection is of importance more especially when the state of motion of
the reference-body is of such a nature that it does not require any external
agency for its maintenance, e.g. in the case when the reference-body is rotating
uniformly.

t w e n t y- t wo
A Few Inferences from the General
Principle of Relativity

The considerations of Section 20 show that the general principle of relativity puts us in a position to derive properties of the
gravitational ﬁeld in a purely theoretical manner. Let us suppose, for instance, that we know the space-time “course” for
any natural process whatsoever, as regards the manner in which
it takes place in the Galileian domain relative to a Galileian
body of reference K. By means of purely theoretical operations
(i.e. simply by calculation) we are then able to ﬁnd how this
known natural process appears, as seen from a reference-body
K which is accelerated relatively to K. But since a gravitational
ﬁeld exists with respect to this new body of reference K, our
consideration also teaches us how the gravitational ﬁeld inﬂuences the process studied.
For example, we learn that a body which is in a state of uniform rectilinear motion with respect to K (in accordance with
the law of Galilei) is executing an accelerated and in general
curvilinear motion with respect to the accelerated referencebody K (chest). This acceleration or curvature corresponds to
the inﬂuence on the moving body of the gravitational ﬁeld
prevailing relatively to K. It is known that a gravitational ﬁeld
inﬂuences the movement of bodies in this way, so that our consideration supplies us with nothing essentially new.
However, we obtain a new result of fundamental importance
when we carry out the analogous consideration for a ray of light.
With respect to the Galileian reference-body K, such a ray of
light is transmitted rectilinearly with the velocity c. It can easily
be shown that the path of the same ray of light is no longer a
straight line when we consider it with reference to the accelerated

70

r e l at i v i t y

chest (reference-body K). From this we conclude, that, in general, rays of light are propagated curvilinearly in gravitational
ﬁelds. In two respects this result is of great importance.
In the ﬁrst place, it can be compared with the reality. Although
a detailed examination of the question shows that the curvature
of light rays required by the general theory of relativity is only
exceedingly small for the gravitational ﬁelds at our disposal in
practice, its estimated magnitude for light rays passing the sun
at grazing incidence is nevertheless 1.7 seconds of arc. This
ought to manifest itself in the following way. As seen from the
earth, certain ﬁxed stars appear to be in the neighbourhood of
the sun, and are thus capable of observation during a total eclipse
of the sun. At such times, these stars ought to appear to be displaced outwards from the sun by an amount indicated above, as
compared with their apparent position in the sky when the sun
is situated at another part of the heavens. The examination of
the correctness or otherwise of this deduction is a problem of
the greatest importance, the early solution of which is to be expected of astronomers.1
In the second place our result shows that, according to the
general theory of relativity, the law of the constancy of the velocity of light in vacuo, which constitutes one of the two fundamental assumptions in the special theory of relativity and to
which we have already frequently referred, cannot claim any
unlimited validity. A curvature of rays of light can only take
place when the velocity of propagation of light varies with position. Now we might think that as a consequence of this, the
special theory of relativity and with it the whole theory of relativity would be laid in the dust. But in reality this is not the
case. We can only conclude that the special theory of relativity
cannot claim an unlimited domain of validity; its results hold
only so long as we are able to disregard the inﬂuences of gravitational ﬁelds on the phenomena (e.g. of light).
1

By means of the star photographs of two expeditions equipped by a Joint
Committee of the Royal and Royal Astronomical Societies, the existence of the
deﬂection of light demanded by theory was ﬁrst conﬁrmed during the solar
eclipse of 29th May, 1919. (Cf. Appendix 3.)

i n f e r e n c e s f ro m t h e p r i n c i p l e o f r e l at i v i t y

71

Since it has often been contended by opponents of the theory
of relativity that the special theory of relativity is overthrown
by the general theory of relativity, it is perhaps advisable to
make the facts of the case clearer by means of an appropriate
comparison. Before the development of electrodynamics the laws
of electrostatics were looked upon as the laws of electricity. At
the present time we know that electric ﬁelds can be derived correctly from electrostatic considerations only for the case, which
is never strictly realised, in which the electrical masses are quite
at rest relatively to each other, and to the co-ordinate system.
Should we be justiﬁed in saying that for this reason electrostatics is overthrown by the ﬁeld-equations of Maxwell in electrodynamics? Not in the least. Electrostatics is contained in
electrodynamics as a limiting case; the laws of the latter lead directly to those of the former for the case in which the ﬁelds are
invariable with regard to time. No fairer destiny could be allotted to any physical theory, than that it should of itself point out
the way to the introduction of a more comprehensive theory, in
which it lives on as a limiting case.
In the example of the transmission of light just dealt with, we
have seen that the general theory of relativity enables us to derive theoretically the inﬂuence of a gravitational ﬁeld on the
course of natural processes, the laws of which are already known
when a gravitational ﬁeld is absent. But the most attractive
problem, to the solution of which the general theory of relativity supplies the key, concerns the investigation of the laws satisﬁed by the gravitational ﬁeld itself. Let us consider this for a
moment.
We are acquainted with space-time domains which behave
(approximately) in a “Galileian” fashion under suitable choice
of reference-body, i.e. domains in which gravitational ﬁelds are
absent. If we now refer such a domain to a reference-body K
possessing any kind of motion, then relative to K there exists a
gravitational ﬁeld which is variable with respect to space and
time.2 The character of this ﬁeld will of course depend on the motion chosen for K. According to the general theory of relativity,
2

This follows from a generalisation of the discussion in Section 20.

72

r e l at i v i t y

the general law of the gravitational ﬁeld must be satisﬁed for all
gravitational ﬁelds obtainable in this way. Even though by no
means all gravitational ﬁelds can be produced in this way, yet we
may entertain the hope that the general law of gravitation will be
derivable from such gravitational ﬁelds of a special kind. This
hope has been realised in the most beautiful manner. But between the clear vision of this goal and its actual realisation it was
necessary to surmount a serious difﬁculty, and as this lies deep at
the root of things, I dare not withhold it from the reader. We require to extend our ideas of the space-time continuum still farther.

t w e n t y- t h r e e
Behaviour of Clocks and Measuring-Rods
on a Rotating Body of Reference

Hitherto I have purposely refrained from speaking about the
physical interpretation of space- and time-data in the case of the
general theory of relativity. As a consequence, I am guilty of a
certain slovenliness of treatment, which, as we know from the
special theory of relativity, is far from being unimportant and
pardonable. It is now high time that we remedy this defect; but I
would mention at the outset, that this matter lays no small claims
on the patience and on the power of abstraction of the reader.
We start off again from quite special cases, which we have
frequently used before. Let us consider a space-time domain in
which no gravitational ﬁeld exists relative to a reference-body
K whose state of motion has been suitably chosen. K is then a
Galileian reference-body as regards the domain considered, and
the results of the special theory of relativity hold relative to K.
Let us suppose the same domain referred to a second body of
reference K, which is rotating uniformly with respect to K. In
order to ﬁx our ideas, we shall imagine K to be in the form of
a plane circular disc, which rotates uniformly in its own plane
about its centre. An observer who is sitting eccentrically on the
disc K is sensible of a force which acts outwards in a radial direction, and which would be interpreted as an effect of inertia
(centrifugal force) by an observer who was at rest with respect
to the original reference-body K. But the observer on the disc
may regard his disc as a reference-body which is “at rest”; on
the basis of the general principle of relativity he is justiﬁed in
doing this. The force acting on himself, and in fact on all other
bodies which are at rest relative to the disc, he regards as the effect of a gravitational ﬁeld. Nevertheless, the space-distribution

74

r e l at i v i t y

of this gravitational ﬁeld is of a kind that would not be possible
on Newton’s theory of gravitation.1 But since the observer believes in the general theory of relativity, this does not disturb
him; he is quite in the right when he believes that a general law
of gravitation can be formulated—a law which not only explains the motion of the stars correctly, but also the ﬁeld of
force experienced by himself.
The observer performs experiments on his circular disc with
clocks and measuring-rods. In doing so, it is his intention to arrive at exact deﬁnitions for the signiﬁcation of time- and spacedata with reference to the circular disc K, these deﬁnitions
being based on his observations. What will be his experience in
this enterprise?
To start with, he places one of two identically constructed
clocks at the centre of the circular disc, and the other on the
edge of the disc, so that they are at rest relative to it. We now
ask ourselves whether both clocks go at the same rate from the
standpoint of the non-rotating Galileian reference-body K. As
judged from this body, the clock at the centre of the disc has no
velocity, whereas the clock at the edge of the disc is in motion
relative to K in consequence of the rotation. According to a result obtained in Section 12, it follows that the latter clock goes
at a rate permanently slower than that of the clock at the centre
of the circular disc, i.e. as observed from K. It is obvious that
the same effect would be noted by an observer whom we will
imagine sitting alongside his clock at the centre of the circular
disc. Thus on our circular disc, or, to make the case more general, in every gravitational ﬁeld, a clock will go more quickly or
less quickly, according to the position in which the clock is situated (at rest). For this reason it is not possible to obtain a reasonable deﬁnition of time with the aid of clocks which are
arranged at rest with respect to the body of reference. A similar
difﬁculty presents itself when we attempt to apply our earlier
deﬁnition of simultaneity in such a case, but I do not wish to go
any farther into this question.
1

The ﬁeld disappears at the centre of the disc and increases proportionally to
the distance from the centre as we proceed outwards.

b e h av i o u r o f c l o c k s a n d m e as u r i n g - ro d s

75

Moreover, at this stage the deﬁnition of the space coordinates
also presents insurmountable difﬁculties. If the observer applies
his standard measuring-rod (a rod which is short as compared
with the radius of the disc) tangentially to the edge of the disc,
then, as judged from the Galileian system, the length of this rod
will be less than 1, since, according to Section 12, moving bodies suffer a shortening in the direction of the motion. On the
other hand, the measuring-rod will not experience a shortening
in length, as judged from K, if it is applied to the disc in the direction of the radius. If, then, the observer ﬁrst measures the
circumference of the disc with his measuring-rod and then the
diameter of the disc, on dividing the one by the other, he will
not obtain as quotient the familiar number   3.14 . . . , but a
larger number,2 whereas of course, for a disc which is at rest
with respect to K, this operation would yield  exactly. This
proves that the propositions of Euclidean geometry cannot hold
exactly on the rotating disc, nor in general in a gravitational
ﬁeld, at least if we attribute the length 1 to the rod in all positions and in every orientation. Hence the idea of a straight line
also loses its meaning. We are therefore not in a position to deﬁne exactly the co-ordinates x, y, z relative to the disc by means
of the method used in discussing the special theory, and as long
as the co-ordinates and times of events have not been deﬁned,
we cannot assign an exact meaning to the natural laws in which
these occur.
Thus all our previous conclusions based on general relativity
would appear to be called in question. In reality we must make
a subtle detour in order to be able to apply the postulate of general relativity exactly. I shall prepare the reader for this in the
following paragraphs.

2

Throughout this consideration we have to use the Galileian (non-rotating)
system K as reference-body, since we may only assume the validity of the results of the special theory of relativity relative to K (relative to K a gravitational ﬁeld prevails).

t w e n t y- f o u r
Euclidean and Non-Euclidean Continuum

The surface of a marble table is spread out in front of me. I can
get from any one point on this table to any other point by passing continuously from one point to a “neighbouring” one, and
repeating this process a (large) number of times, or, in other
words, by going from point to point without executing “jumps.”
I am sure the reader will appreciate with sufﬁcient clearness
what I mean here by “neighbouring” and by “jumps” (if he is
not too pedantic). We express this property of the surface by
describing the latter as a continuum.
Let us now imagine that a large number of little rods of equal
length have been made, their lengths being small compared
with the dimensions of the marble slab. When I say they are of
equal length, I mean that one can be laid on any other without
the ends overlapping. We next lay four of these little rods on
the marble slab so that they constitute a quadrilateral ﬁgure (a
square), the diagonals of which are equally long. To ensure the
equality of the diagonals, we make use of a little testing-rod. To
this square we add similar ones, each of which has one rod in
common with the ﬁrst. We proceed in like manner with each of
these squares until ﬁnally the whole marble slab is laid out with
squares. The arrangement is such, that each side of a square belongs to two squares and each corner to four squares.
It is a veritable wonder that we can carry out this business
without getting into the greatest difﬁculties. We only need to
think of the following. If at any moment three squares meet at a
corner, then two sides of the fourth square are already laid, and,
as a consequence, the arrangement of the remaining two sides of
the square is already completely determined. But I am now no

euclidean and non-euclidean continuum

77

longer able to adjust the quadrilateral so that its diagonals may
be equal. If they are equal of their own accord, then this is an
especial favour of the marble slab and of the little rods, about
which I can only be thankfully surprised. We must needs experience many such surprises if the construction is to be successful.
If everything has really gone smoothly, then I say that the
points of the marble slab constitute a Euclidean continuum
with respect to the little rod, which has been used as a “distance”
(line-interval). By choosing one corner of a square as “origin,”
I can characterize every other corner of a square with reference
to this origin by means of two numbers. I only need state how
many rods I must pass over when, starting from the origin, I proceed towards the “right” and then “upwards,” in order to arrive
at the corner of the square under consideration. These two numbers are then the “Cartesian co-ordinates” of this corner with
reference to the “Cartesian co-ordinate system” which is determined by the arrangement of little rods.
By making use of the following modiﬁcation of this abstract
experiment, we recognize that there must also be cases in which
the experiment would be unsuccessful. We shall suppose that
the rods “expand” by an amount proportional to the increase
of temperature. We heat the central part of the marble slab, but
not the periphery, in which case two of our little rods can still
be brought into coincidence at every position on the table. But
our construction of squares must necessarily come into disorder
during the heating, because the little rods on the central region
of the table expand, whereas those on the outer part do not.
With reference to our little rods—deﬁned as unit lengths—
the marble slab is no longer a Euclidean continuum, and we are
also no longer in the position of deﬁning Cartesian co-ordinates
directly with their aid, since the above construction can no
longer be carried out. But since there are other things which are
not inﬂuenced in a similar manner to the little rods (or perhaps
not at all) by the temperature of the table, it is possible quite naturally to maintain the point of view that the marble slab is a “Euclidean continuum.” This can be done in a satisfactory manner
by making a more subtle stipulation about the measurement or
the comparison of lengths.

78

But if rods of every kind (i.e. of every material) were to behave in the same way as regards the inﬂuence of temperature
when they are on the variably heated marble slab, and if we had
no other means of detecting the effect of temperature than the
geometrical behaviour of our rods in experiments analogous to
the one described above, then our best plan would be to assign
the distance one to two points on the slab, provided that the
ends of one of our rods could be made to coincide with these
two points; for how else should we deﬁne the distance without
our proceeding being in the highest measure grossly arbitrary?
The method of Cartesian co-ordinates must then be discarded,
and replaced by another which does not assume the validity of
Euclidean geometry for rigid bodies.1 The reader will notice
that the situation depicted here corresponds to the one brought
about by the general postulate of relativity (Section 23).

Mathematicians have been confronted with our problem in the following
form. If we are given a surface (e.g. an ellipsoid) in Euclidean three-dimensional
space, then there exists for this surface a two-dimensional geometry, just as
much as for a plane surface. Gauss undertook the task of treating this twodimensional geometry from ﬁrst principles, without making use of the fact that
the surface belongs to a Euclidean continuum of three dimensions. If we imagine constructions to be made with rigid rods in the surface (similar to that above
with the marble slab), we should ﬁnd that different laws hold for these from
those resulting on the basis of Euclidean plane geometry. The surface is not a
Euclidean continuum with respect to the rods, and we cannot deﬁne Cartesian
co-ordinates in the surface. Gauss indicated the principles according to which
we can treat the geometrical relationships in the surface, and thus pointed
out the way to the method of Riemann of treating multi-dimensional, nonEuclidean continua. Thus it is that mathematicians long ago solved the formal
problems to which we are led by the general postulate of relativity.

Gaussian Co-ordinates

According to Gauss, this combined analytical and geometrical
mode of handling the problem can be arrived at in the following
way. We imagine a system of arbitrary curves (see Fig. 4) drawn
on the surface of the table. These we designate as ucurves, and
we indicate each of them by means of a number. The curves
u  1, u  2 and u  3 are drawn in the diagram. Between the
curves u  1 and u  2 we must imagine an inﬁnitely large number to be drawn, all of which correspond to real numbers lying
between 1 and 2. We have then a system of u-curves, and this
“inﬁnitely dense” system covers the whole surface of the table.
These u-curves must not intersect each other, and through each
point of the surface one and only one curve must pass. Thus a
perfectly deﬁnite value of u belongs to every point on the surface
of the marble slab. In like manner we imagine a system of vcurves drawn on the surface. These satisfy the same conditions
as the u-curves, they are provided with numbers in a correspon-

ding manner, and they may likewise be of arbitrary shape. It follows that a value of u and a value of v belong to every point
on the surface of the table. We call these two numbers the coordinates of the surface of the table (Gaussian co-ordinates). For
example, the point P in the diagram has the Gaussian coordinates u  3, v  1. Two neighbouring points P and P on the
surface then correspond to the co-ordinates
P:
P:

u, v
u  du, v  dv,

where du and dv signify very small numbers. In a similar manner we may indicate the distance (line-interval) between P and
P, as measured with a little rod, by means of the very small
number ds. Then according to Gauss we have
ds2  g11du2  2g12dudv  g22dv2,
where g11, g12, g22, are magnitudes which depend in a perfectly
deﬁnite way to u and v. The magnitudes g11, g12 and g22 determine the behaviour of the rods relative to the u-curves and vcurves, and thus also relative to the surface of the table. For the
case in which the points of the surface considered form a Euclidean continuum with reference to the measuring-rods, but only in
this case, it is possible to draw the u-curves and v-curves and to
attach numbers to them, in such a manner, that we simply have:
ds2  du2  dv2.
Under these conditions, the u-curves and v-curves are straight
lines in the sense of Euclidean geometry, and they are perpendicular to each other. Here the Gaussian co-ordinates are simply
Cartesian ones. It is clear that Gauss co-ordinates are nothing
more than an association of two sets of numbers with the
points of the surface considered, of such a nature that numerical
values differing very slightly from each other are associated with
neighbouring points “in space.”
So far, these considerations hold for a continuum of two

g au s s i a n c o - o r d i n at e s

81

dimensions. But the Gaussian method can be applied also to a
continuum of three, four or more dimensions. If, for instance, a
continuum of four dimensions be supposed available, we may
represent it in the following way. With every point of the continuum we associate arbitrarily four numbers, x1, x2, x3, x4,
which are known as “co-ordinates.” Adjacent points correspond
to adjacent values of the co-ordinates. If a distance ds is associated with the adjacent points P and P, this distance being measurable and well-deﬁned from a physical point of view, then the
following formula holds:
ds2  g11dx12  2g12dx1dx2 . . . .  g44dx42,
where the magnitudes g11, etc., have values which vary with the
position in the continuum. Only when the continuum is a Euclidean one is it possible to associate the co-ordinates x1 . . . x4
with the points of the continuum so that we have simply
ds2  dx12  dx22  dx32  dx42.
In this case relations hold in the four-dimensional continuum
which are analogous to those holding in our three-dimensional
measurements.
However, the Gauss treatment for ds2 which we have given
above is not always possible. It is only possible when sufﬁciently small regions of the continuum under consideration may
be regarded as Euclidean continua. For example, this obviously
holds in the case of the marble slab of the table and local variation of temperature. The temperature is practically constant for
a small part of the slab, and thus the geometrical behaviour of
the rods is almost as it ought to be according to the rules of Euclidean geometry. Hence the imperfections of the construction
of squares in the previous section do not show themselves clearly
until this construction is extended over a considerable portion
of the surface of the table.
We can sum this up as follows: Gauss invented a method for
the mathematical treatment of continua in general, in which
“size-relations” (“distances” between neighbouring points) are

82

r e l at i v i t y

deﬁned. To every point of a continuum are assigned as many
numbers (Gaussian co-ordinates) as the continuum has dimensions. This is done in such a way, that only one meaning can be
attached to the assignment, and that numbers (Gaussian coordinates) which differ by an indeﬁnitely small amount are assigned to adjacent points. The Gaussian co-ordinate system is
a logical generalisation of the Cartesian co-ordinate system. It
is also applicable to non-Euclidean continua, but only when,
with respect to the deﬁned “size” or “distance,” small parts of
the continuum under consideration behave more nearly like a
Euclidean system, the smaller the part of the continuum under
our notice.

t w e n t y- s i x
The Space-Time Continuum of the Special
Theory of Relativity Considered
as a Euclidean Continuum

We are now in a position to formulate more exactly the idea of
Minkowski, which was only vaguely indicated in Section 17. In
accordance with the special theory of relativity, certain coordinate systems are given preference for the description of the
four-dimensional, space-time continuum. We called these
“Galileian co-ordinate systems.” For these systems, the four coordinates x, y, z, t, which determine an event or—in other
words—a point of the four-dimensional continuum, are deﬁned
physically in a simple manner, as set forth in detail in the ﬁrst
part of this book. For the transition from one Galileian system
to another, which is moving uniformly with reference to the
ﬁrst, the equations of the Lorentz transformation are valid.
These last form the basis for the derivation of deductions from
the special theory of relativity, and in themselves they are nothing more than the expression of the universal validity of the law
of transmission of light for all Galileian systems of reference.
Minkowski found that the Lorentz transformations satisfy
the following simple conditions. Let us consider two neighbouring events, the relative position of which in the four-dimensional
continuum is given with respect to a Galileian reference-body K
by the space co-ordinate differences dx, dy, dz and the timedifference dt. With reference to a second Galileian system we
shall suppose that the corresponding differences for these two
events are dx, dy, dz, dt. Then these magnitudes always fulﬁl
the condition1
1

Cf. Appendices 1 and 2. The relations which are derived there for the coordinates themselves are valid also for co-ordinate differences, and thus also
for co-ordinate differentials (indeﬁnitely small differences).

84

dx2  dy2  dz2  c2dt2  dx2  dy2  dz2  c2dt2.
The validity of the Lorentz transformation follows from this
condition. We can express this as follows: The magnitude
ds2  dx2  dy2  dz2  c2dt2,
which belongs to two adjacent points of the four-dimensional
space-time continuum, has the same value for all selected
(Galileian) reference-bodies. If we replace x, y, z �1
� ct, by
x1, x2, x3, x4, we also obtain the result that
ds2  dx12  dx22  dx32  dx42
is independent of the choice of the body of reference. We call
the magnitude ds the “distance” apart of the two events or
four-dimensional points.
Thus, if we choose as time-variable the imaginary variable
�1
� ct instead of the real quantity t, we can regard the spacetime continuum—in accordance with the special theory of
relativity—as a “Euclidean” four-dimensional continuum, a result which follows from the considerations of the preceding
section.

t w e n t y- s e v e n
The Space-Time Continuum
of the General Theory of Relativity
Is Not a Euclidean Continuum

In the ﬁrst part of this book we were able to make use of spacetime co-ordinates which allowed of a simple and direct physical
interpretation, and which, according to Section 26, can be regarded as four-dimensional Cartesian co-ordinates. This was
possible on the basis of the law of the constancy of the velocity
of light. But according to Section 21, the general theory of relativity cannot retain this law. On the contrary, we arrived at the
result that according to this latter theory the velocity of light
must always depend on the coordinates when a gravitational
ﬁeld is present. In connection with a speciﬁc illustration in Section 23, we found that the presence of a gravitational ﬁeld invalidates the deﬁnition of the co-ordinates and the time, which
led us to our objective in the special theory of relativity.
In view of the results of these considerations we are led to the
conviction that, according to the general principle of relativity,
the space-time continuum cannot be regarded as a Euclidean one,
but that here we have the general case, corresponding to the marble slab with local variations of temperature, and with which we
made acquaintance as an example of a two-dimensional continuum. Just as it was there impossible to construct a Cartesian coordinate system from equal rods, so here it is impossible to build
up a system (reference-body) from rigid bodies and clocks,
which shall be of such a nature that measuring-rods and clocks,
arranged rigidly with respect to one another, shall indicate position and time directly. Such was the essence of the difﬁculty with
which we were confronted in Section 23.
But the considerations of Sections 25 and 26 show us the
way to surmount this difﬁculty. We refer the four-dimensional

86

r e l at i v i t y

space-time continuum in an arbitrary manner to Gauss coordinates. We assign to every point of the continuum (event)
four numbers, x1, x2, x3, x4 (co-ordinates), which have not the
least direct physical signiﬁcance, but only serve the purpose of
numbering the points of the continuum in a deﬁnite but arbitrary manner. This arrangement does not even need to be of such
a kind that we must regard x1, x2, x3 as “space” co-ordinates and
x4 as a “time” co-ordinate.
The reader may think that such a description of the world
would be quite inadequate. What does it mean to assign to an
event the particular co-ordinates x1, x2, x3, x4, if in themselves
these co-ordinates have no signiﬁcance? More careful consideration shows, however, that this anxiety is unfounded. Let us
consider, for instance, a material point with any kind of motion. If this point had only a momentary existence without
duration, then it would be described in space-time by a single
system of values x1, x2, x3, x4. Thus its permanent existence
must be characterised by an inﬁnitely large number of such systems of values, the co-ordinate values of which are so close together as to give continuity; corresponding to the material point,
we thus have a (uni-dimensional) line in the four-dimensional
continuum. In the same way, any such lines in our continuum
correspond to many points in motion. The only statements having regard to these points which can claim a physical existence
are in reality the statements about their encounters. In our mathematical treatment, such an encounter is expressed in the fact
that the two lines which represent the motions of the points in
question have a particular system of co-ordinate values, x1, x2,
x3, x4, in common. After mature consideration the reader will
doubtless admit that in reality such encounters constitute the
only actual evidence of a time-space nature with which we meet
in physical statements.
When we were describing the motion of a material point relative to a body of reference, we stated nothing more than the
encounters of this point with particular points of the referencebody. We can also determine the corresponding values of the
time by the observation of encounters of the body with clocks,
in conjunction with the observation of the encounter of the

s pac e - t i m e c o n t i n u u m o f t h e g e n e r a l t h e o ry

87

hands of clocks with particular points on the dials. It is just the
same in the case of space-measurements by means of measuring-rods, as a little consideration will show.
The following statements hold generally: Every physical description resolves itself into a number of statements, each of
which refers to the space-time coincidence of two events A and
B. In terms of Gaussian co-ordinates, every such statement is
expressed by the agreement of their four co-ordinates x1, x2,
x3, x4. Thus in reality, the description of the time-space continuum by means of Gauss co-ordinates completely replaces the
description with the aid of a body of reference, without suffering from the defects of the latter mode of description; it is not
tied down to the Euclidean character of the continuum which
has to be represented.

t w e n t y- e i g h t
Exact Formulation of the General
Principle of Relativity

We are now in a position to replace the provisional formulation
of the general principle of relativity given in Section 18 by an
exact formulation. The form there used, “All bodies of reference K, K, etc., are equivalent for the description of natural
phenomena (formulation of the general laws of nature), whatever may be their state of motion,” cannot be maintained, because the use of rigid reference-bodies, in the sense of the method
followed in the special theory of relativity, is in general not possible in space-time description. The Gauss co-ordinate system
has to take the place of the body of reference. The following
statement corresponds to the fundamental idea of the general
principle of relativity: “All Gaussian co-ordinate systems are
essentially equivalent for the formulation of the general laws of
nature.”
We can state this general principle of relativity in still another
form, which renders it yet more clearly intelligible than it is
when in the form of the natural extension of the special principle of relativity. According to the special theory of relativity,
the equations which express the general laws of nature pass
over into equations of the same form when, by making use of
the Lorentz transformation, we replace the space-time variables
x, y, z, t, of a (Galileian) reference-body K by the space-time
variables x, y, z, t, of a new reference-body K. According to
the general theory of relativity, on the other hand, by application of arbitrary substitutions of the Gauss variables x1, x2, x3,
x4, the equations must pass over into equations of the same
form; for every transformation (not only the Lorentz transfor-

e x ac t f o r m u l at i o n o f t h e p r i n c i p l e o f r e l at i v i t y

89

mation) corresponds to the transition of one Gauss co-ordinate
system into another.
If we desire to adhere to our “old-time” three-dimensional
view of things, then we can characterise the development which
is being undergone by the fundamental idea of the general theory of relativity as follows: The special theory of relativity has
reference to Galileian domains, i.e. to those in which no gravitational ﬁeld exists. In this connection a Galileian referencebody serves as body of reference, i.e. a rigid body the state of
motion of which is so chosen that the Galileian law of the uniform rectilinear motion of “isolated” material points holds relatively to it.
Certain considerations suggest that we should refer the same
Galileian domains to non-Galileian reference-bodies also. A
gravitational ﬁeld of a special kind is then present with respect
to these bodies (cf. Sections 20 and 23).
In gravitational ﬁelds there are no such things as rigid bodies
with Euclidean properties; thus the ﬁctitious rigid body of reference is of no avail in the general theory of relativity. The motion of clocks is also inﬂuenced by gravitational ﬁelds, and in
such a way that a physical deﬁnition of time which is made directly with the aid of clocks has by no means the same degree
of plausibility as in the special theory of relativity.
For this reason non-rigid reference-bodies are used, which
are as a whole not only moving in any way whatsoever, but
which also suffer alterations in form ad lib. during their motion. Clocks, for which the law of motion is of any kind, however irregular, serve for the deﬁnition of time. We have to
imagine each of these clocks ﬁxed at a point on the non-rigid
reference-body. These clocks satisfy only the one condition,
that the “readings” which are observed simultaneously on adjacent clocks (in space) differ from each other by an indeﬁnitely
small amount. This non-rigid reference-body, which might appropriately be termed a “reference-mollusc,” is in the main
equivalent to a Gaussian four-dimensional co-ordinate system
chosen arbitrarily. That which gives the “mollusc” a certain
comprehensibility as compared with the Gauss co-ordinate

90

r e l at i v i t y

system is the (really unjustiﬁed) formal retention of the separate
existence of the space co-ordinates as opposed to the time coordinate. Every point on the mollusc is treated as a space-point,
and every material point which is at rest relatively to it as at
rest, so long as the mollusc is considered as reference-body. The
general principle of relativity requires that all these molluscs
can be used as reference-bodies with equal right and equal success in the formulation of the general laws of nature; the laws
themselves must be quite independent of the choice of mollusc.
The great power possessed by the general principle of relativity lies in the comprehensive limitation which is imposed on the
laws of nature in consequence of what we have seen above.

t w e n t y- n i n e
The Solution of the Problem of Gravitation
on the Basis of the General Principle
of Relativity

If the reader has followed all our previous considerations, he
will have no further difﬁculty in understanding the methods
leading to the solution of the problem of gravitation.
We start off from a consideration of a Galileian domain, i.e.
a domain in which there is no gravitational ﬁeld relative to the
Galileian reference-body K. The behaviour of measuring-rods
and clocks with reference to K is known from the special theory
of relativity, likewise the behaviour of “isolated” material points;
the latter move uniformly and in straight lines.
Now let us refer this domain to a random Gauss co-ordinate
system or to a “mollusc” as reference-body K. Then with respect to K there is a gravitational ﬁeld G (of a particular kind).
We learn the behaviour of measuring-rods and clocks and also
of freely-moving material points with reference to K simply by
mathematical transformation. We interpret this behaviour as
the behaviour of measuring-rods, clocks and material points
under the inﬂuence of the gravitational ﬁeld G. Hereupon we
introduce a hypothesis: that the inﬂuence of the gravitational
field on measuring-rods, clocks and freely-moving material points
continues to take place according to the same laws, even in the
case where the prevailing gravitational ﬁeld is not derivable
from the Galileian special case, simply by means of a transformation of co-ordinates.
The next step is to investigate the space-time behaviour of the
gravitational ﬁeld G, which was derived from the Galileian special case simply by transformation of the co-ordinates. This behaviour is formulated in a law, which is always valid, no matter

92

r e l at i v i t y

how the reference-body (mollusc) used in the description may
be chosen.
This law is not yet the general law of the gravitational ﬁeld,
since the gravitational ﬁeld under consideration is of a special
kind. In order to ﬁnd out the general law-of-ﬁeld of gravitation
we still require to obtain a generalisation of the law as found
above. This can be obtained without caprice, however, by taking into consideration the following demands:
(a) The required generalisation must likewise satisfy the general postulate of relativity.
(b) If there is any matter in the domain under consideration,
only its inertial mass, and thus according to Section 15 only
its energy is of importance for its effect in exciting a ﬁeld.
(c) Gravitational ﬁeld and matter together must satisfy the
law of the conservation of energy (and of impulse).
Finally, the general principle of relativity permits us to determine the inﬂuence of the gravitational ﬁeld on the course of all
those processes which take place according to known laws
when a gravitational ﬁeld is absent, i.e. which have already
been ﬁtted into the frame of the special theory of relativity. In
this connection we proceed in principle according to the method
which has already been explained for measuring-rods, clocks and
freely-moving material points.
The theory of gravitation derived in this way from the general postulate of relativity excels not only in its beauty; nor in
removing the defect attaching to classical mechanics which was
brought to light in Section 21; nor in interpreting the empirical
law of the equality of inertial and gravitational mass; but it has
also already explained a result of observation in astronomy,
against which classical mechanics is powerless.
If we conﬁne the application of the theory to the case where
the gravitational ﬁelds can be regarded as being weak, and in
which all masses move with respect to the co-ordinate system
with velocities which are small compared with the velocity of
light, we then obtain as a ﬁrst approximation the Newtonian
theory. Thus the latter theory is obtained here without any particular assumption, whereas Newton had to introduce the hypothesis that the force of attraction between mutually attracting

s o l u t i o n o f g r av i tat i o n

93

material points is inversely proportional to the square of the
distance between them. If we increase the accuracy of the calculation, deviations from the theory of Newton make their appearance, practically all of which must nevertheless escape the test of
observation owing to their smallness.
We must draw attention here to one of these deviations. According to Newton’s theory, a planet moves round the sun in an
ellipse, which would permanently maintain its position with respect to the ﬁxed stars, if we could disregard the motion of the
ﬁxed stars themselves and the action of the other planets under
consideration. Thus, if we correct the observed motion of the
planets for these two inﬂuences, and if Newton’s theory be
strictly correct, we ought to obtain for the orbit of the planet an
ellipse, which is ﬁxed with reference to the ﬁxed stars. This deduction, which can be tested with great accuracy, has been conﬁrmed for all the planets save one, with the precision that is
capable of being obtained by the delicacy of observation attainable at the present time. The sole exception is Mercury, the
planet which lies nearest the sun. Since the time of Leverrier, it
has been known that the ellipse corresponding to the orbit
of Mercury, after it has been corrected for the inﬂuences mentioned above, is not stationary with respect to the ﬁxed stars,
but that it rotates exceedingly slowly in the plane of the orbit
and in the sense of the orbital motion. The value obtained for
this rotary movement of the orbital ellipse was 43 seconds of
arc per century, an amount ensured to be correct to within a
few seconds of arc. This effect can be explained by means of
classical mechanics only on the assumption of hypotheses
which have little probability, and which were devised solely for
this purpose.
On the basis of the general theory of relativity, it is found that
the ellipse of every planet round the sun must necessarily rotate
in the manner indicated above; that for all the planets, with the
exception of Mercury, this rotation is too small to be detected
with the delicacy of observation possible at the present time;
but that in the case of Mercury it must amount to 43 seconds
of arc per century, a result which is strictly in agreement with
observation.

94

r e l at i v i t y

Apart from this one, it has hitherto been possible to make
only two deductions from the theory which admit of being
tested by observation, to wit, the curvature of light rays by the
gravitational ﬁeld of the sun,1 and a displacement of the spectral lines of light reaching us from large stars, as compared with
the corresponding lines for light produced in an analogous
manner terrestrially (i.e. by the same kind of atom). I do not
doubt that these deductions from the theory will be conﬁrmed
also.

t h i rt y
Cosmological Difﬁculties
of Newton’s Theory

Apart from the difﬁculty discussed in Section 21, there is a second fundamental difﬁculty attending classical celestial mechanics, which, to the best of my knowledge, was ﬁrst discussed in
detail by the astronomer Seeliger. If we ponder over the questions as to how the universe, considered as a whole, is to be regarded, the ﬁrst answer that suggests itself to us is surely this: As
regards space (and time) the universe is inﬁnite. There are stars
everywhere, so that the density of matter, although very variable
in detail, is nevertheless on the average everywhere the same. In
other words: However far we might travel through space, we
should ﬁnd everywhere an attenuated swarm of ﬁxed stars of
approximately the same kind and density.
This view is not in harmony with the theory of Newton. The
latter theory rather requires that the universe should have a kind
of centre in which the density of the stars is a maximum, and
that as we proceed outwards from this centre the group-density
of the stars should diminish, until ﬁnally, at great distances, it is
succeeded by an inﬁnite region of emptiness. The stellar universe ought to be a ﬁnite island in the inﬁnite ocean of space.1
1
Proof—According to the theory of Newton, the number of “lines of force”
which come from inﬁnity and terminate in a mass m is proportional to the
mass m. If, on the average, the mass density p0 is constant throughout the universe, then a sphere of volume V will enclose the average mass p0V. Thus the
number of lines of force passing through the surface F of the sphere into its
interior is proportional to p0V. For unit area of the surface of the sphere the
V
number of lines of force which enters the sphere is thus proportional to p0  or
F
to p0R. Hence the intensity of the ﬁeld at the surface would ultimately become
inﬁnite with increasing radius R of the sphere, which is impossible.

98

r e l at i v i t y

This conception is in itself not very satisfactory. It is still less
satisfactory because it leads to the result that the light emitted
by the stars and also individual stars of the stellar system are
perpetually passing out into inﬁnite space, never to return, and
without ever again coming into interaction with other objects
of nature. Such a ﬁnite material universe would be destined to
become gradually but systematically impoverished.
In order to escape this dilemma, Seeliger suggested a modiﬁcation of Newton’s law, in which he assumes that for great distances the force of attraction between two masses diminishes
more rapidly than would result from the inverse square law. In
this way it is possible for the mean density of matter to be constant everywhere, even to inﬁnity, without inﬁnitely large gravitational ﬁelds being produced. We thus free ourselves from the
distasteful conception that the material universe ought to possess something of the nature of a centre. Of course we purchase
our emancipation from the fundamental difﬁculties mentioned,
at the cost of a modiﬁcation and complication of Newton’s law
which has neither empirical nor theoretical foundation. We can
imagine innumerable laws which would serve the same purpose,
without our being able to state a reason why one of them is to
be preferred to the others; for any one of these laws would be
founded just as little on more general theoretical principles as is
the law of Newton.

t h i rt y- o n e
The Possibility of a “Finite” and Yet
“Unbounded” Universe

But speculations on the structure of the universe also move in
quite another direction. The development of non-Euclidean
geometry led to the recognition of the fact, that we can cast
doubt on the inﬁniteness of our space without coming into conﬂict with the laws of thought or with experience (Riemann,
Helmholtz). These questions have already been treated in detail
and with unsurpassable lucidity by Helmholtz and Poincaré,
whereas I can only touch on them brieﬂy here.
In the ﬁrst place, we imagine an existence in two-dimensional
space. Flat beings with ﬂat implements, and in particular ﬂat
rigid measuring-rods, are free to move in a plane. For them
nothing exists outside of this plane: that which they observe
to happen to themselves and to their ﬂat “things” is the allinclusive reality of their plane. In particular, the constructions
of plane Euclidean geometry can be carried out by means of the
rods, e.g. the lattice construction, considered in Section 24.
In contrast to ours, the universe of these beings is twodimensional; but, like ours, it extends to inﬁnity. In their universe there is room for an inﬁnite number of identical squares
made up of rods, i.e. its volume (surface) is inﬁnite. If these beings say their universe is “plane,” there is sense in the statement,
because they mean that they can perform the constructions of
plane Euclidean geometry with their rods. In this connection
the individual rods always represent the same distance, independently of their position.
Let us consider now a second two-dimensional existence, but
this time on a spherical surface instead of on a plane. The ﬂat
beings with their measuring-rods and other objects ﬁt exactly

100

r e l at i v i t y

on this surface and they are unable to leave it. Their whole universe of observation extends exclusively over the surface of the
sphere. Are these beings able to regard the geometry of their
universe as being plane geometry and their rods withal as the
realisation of “distance”? They cannot do this. For if they attempt to realise a straight line, they will obtain a curve, which
we “three-dimensional beings” designate as a great circle, i.e. a
self-contained line of deﬁnite ﬁnite length, which can be measured up by means of a measuring-rod. Similarly, this universe
has a ﬁnite area that can be compared with the area of a square
constructed with rods. The great charm resulting from this
consideration lies in the recognition of the fact that the universe
of these beings is ﬁnite and yet has no limits.
But the spherical-surface beings do not need to go on a
world-tour in order to perceive that they are not living in a Euclidean universe. They can convince themselves of this on every
part of their “world,” provided they do not use too small a
piece of it. Starting from a point, they draw “straight lines”
(arcs of circles as judged in three-dimensional space) of equal
length in all directions. They will call the line joining the free
ends of these lines a “circle.” For a plane surface, the ratio of
the circumference of a circle to its diameter, both lengths being
measured with the same rod, is, according to Euclidean geometry of the plane, equal to a constant value , which is independent of the diameter of the circle. On their spherical surface our
ﬂat beings would ﬁnd for this ratio the value
r
sin 
R ,
 

R

i.e. a smaller value than , the difference being the more considerable, the greater is the radius of the circle in comparison
with the radius R of the “world-sphere.” By means of this relation the spherical beings can determine the radius of their universe (“world”), even when only a relatively small part of their
world-sphere is available for their measurements. But if this
part is very small indeed, they will no longer be able to demon-

p o s s i b i l i t y o f “ f i n i t e ” y e t “ u n b o u n d e d ” u n i v e rs e

101

strate that they are on a spherical “world” and not on a Euclidean plane, for a small part of a spherical surface differs only
slightly from a piece of a plane of the same size.
Thus if the spherical-surface beings are living on a planet of
which the solar system occupies only a negligibly small part
of the spherical universe, they have no means of determining
whether they are living in a ﬁnite or in an inﬁnite universe, because the “piece of universe” to which they have access is in
both cases practically plane, or Euclidean. It follows directly
from this discussion, that for our sphere-beings the circumference of a circle ﬁrst increases with the radius until the “circumference of the universe” is reached, and that it thence-forward
gradually decreases to zero for still further increasing values
of the radius. During this process the area of the circle continues to increase more and more, until ﬁnally it becomes equal to
the total area of the whole “world-sphere.”
Perhaps the reader will wonder why we have placed our “beings” on a sphere rather than on another closed surface. But
this choice has its justiﬁcation in the fact that, of all closed surfaces, the sphere is unique in possessing the property that all
points on it are equivalent. I admit that the ratio of the circumference c of circle to its radius r depends on r, but for a given
value of r it is the same for all points of the “world-sphere”; in
other words, the “world-sphere” is a “surface of constant curvature.”
To this two-dimensional sphere-universe there is a threedimensional analogy, namely, the three-dimensional spherical
space which was discovered by Riemann. Its points are likewise
all equivalent. It possesses a ﬁnite volume, which is determined
by its “radius” (22R3). Is it possible to imagine a spherical
space? To imagine a space means nothing else than that we
imagine an epitome of our “space” experience, i.e. of experience that we can have in the movement of “rigid” bodies. In
this sense we can imagine a spherical space.
Suppose we draw lines or stretch strings in all directions
from a point, and mark off from each of these the distance 
with a measuring-rod. All the free end-points of these lengths
lie on a spherical surface. We can specially measure up the area

102

r e l at i v i t y

(F) of this surface by means of a square made up of measuringrods. If the universe is Euclidean, then F  42; if it is spherical, then F is always less than 42. With increasing values of ,
F increases from zero up to a maximum value which is determined by the “world-radius,” but for still further increasing
values of , the area gradually diminishes to zero. At ﬁrst, the
straight lines which radiate from the starting point diverge farther and farther from one another, but later they approach each
other, and ﬁnally they run together again at a “counter-point” to
the starting point. Under such conditions they have traversed the
whole spherical space. It is easily seen that the three-dimensional
spherical space is quite analogous to the two-dimensional spherical surface. It is ﬁnite (i.e. of ﬁnite volume), and has no bounds.
It may be mentioned that there is yet another kind of curved
space: “elliptical space.” It can be regarded as a curved space in
which the two “counter-points” are identical (indistinguishable
from each other). An elliptical universe can thus be considered to
some extent as a curved universe possessing central symmetry.
It follows from what has been said, that closed spaces without limits are conceivable. From amongst these, the spherical
space (and the elliptical) excels in its simplicity, since all points
on it are equivalent. As a result of this discussion, a most interesting question arises for astronomers and physicists, and that
is whether the universe in which we live is inﬁnite, or whether it
is ﬁnite in the manner of the spherical universe. Our experience is
far from being sufﬁcient to enable us to answer this question.
But the general theory of relativity permits of our answering it
with a moderate degree of certainty, and in this connection the
difﬁculty mentioned in Section 30 ﬁnds its solution.

t h i rt y- t wo
The Structure of Space According to
the General Theory of Relativity

According to the general theory of relativity, the geometrical
properties of space are not independent, but they are determined
by matter. Thus we can draw conclusions about the geometrical
structure of the universe only if we base our considerations on
the state of the matter as being something that is known. We
know from experience that, for a suitably chosen co-ordinate system, the velocities of the stars are small as compared with the
velocity of transmission of light. We can thus as a rough approximation arrive at a conclusion as to the nature of the universe as
a whole, if we treat the matter as being at rest.
We already know from our previous discussion that the behaviour of measuring-rods and clocks is inﬂuenced by gravitational ﬁelds, i.e. by the distribution of matter. This in itself is
sufﬁcient to exclude the possibility of the exact validity of Euclidean geometry in our universe. But it is conceivable that our
universe differs only slightly from a Euclidean one, and this
notion seems all the more probable, since calculations show
that the metrics of surrounding space is inﬂuenced only to an
exceedingly small extent by masses even of the magnitude of
our sun. We might imagine that, as regards geometry, our universe behaves analogously to a surface which is irregularly
curved in its individual parts, but which nowhere departs appreciably from a plane: something like the rippled surface of
a lake. Such a universe might ﬁttingly be called a quasiEuclidean universe. As regards its space it would be inﬁnite.
But calculation shows that in a quasi-Euclidean universe the
average density of matter would necessarily be nil. Thus such a
universe could not be inhabited by matter everywhere; it would

104

r e l at i v i t y

present to us that unsatisfactory picture which we portrayed in
Section 30.
If we are to have in the universe an average density of matter
which differs from zero, however small may be that difference,
then the universe cannot be quasi-Euclidean. On the contrary,
the results of calculation indicate that if matter be distributed
uniformly, the universe would necessarily be spherical (or elliptical). Since in reality the detailed distribution of matter is not
uniform, the real universe will deviate in individual parts from
the spherical, i.e. the universe will be quasi-spherical. But it will
be necessarily ﬁnite. In fact, the theory supplies us with a simple
connection1 between the space-expanse of the universe and the
average density of matter in it.

Simple Derivation
of the Lorentz Transformation
[Supplementary to Section 11]

For the relative orientation of the co-ordinate systems indicated
in Fig. 2, the x-axes of both systems permanently coincide. In
the present case we can divide the problem into parts by considering ﬁrst only events which are localised on the x-axis. Any
such event is represented with respect to the co-ordinate system
K by the abscissa x and the time t, and with respect to the system K by the abscissa x and the time t. We require to ﬁnd x
and t when x and t are given.
A light-signal, which is proceeding along the positive axis of
x, is transmitted according to the equation
x  ct
or
x  ct  0

.

.

.

(1).

Since the same light-signal has to be transmitted relative to K
with the velocity c, the propagation relative to the system K
will be represented by the analogous formula
x  ct  0

.

.

.

(2).

Those space-time points (events) which satisfy (1) must also satisfy (2). Obviously this will be the case when the relation
N(x  ct)  (x  ct)

.

.

.

(3),

106

r e l at i v i t y

is fulﬁlled in general, where  indicates a constant; for, according to (3), the disappearance of (x  ct) involves the disappearance of (x  ct).
If we apply quite similar considerations to light rays which
are being transmitted along the negative x-axis, we obtain the
condition
(x  ct)  (x  ct)

.

.

.

(4).

By adding (or subtracting) equations (3) and (4), and introducing for convenience the constants a and b in place of the
constants  and , where

a  
2
and
–
b  ,
2
we obtain the equations

�

x  ax  bct
ct  act  bx

.

.

.

(5).

We should thus have the solution of our problem, if the constants a and b were known. These result from the following
discussion.
For the origin of K we have permanently x 0, and hence
according to the ﬁrst of the equations (5)
bc
x  t.
a
If we call v the velocity with which the origin of K is moving
relative to K, we then have
bc

a

.

.

.

(6).

a p p e n d i x o n e : t h e l o r e n t z t r a n s f o r m at i o n

107

The same value v can be obtained from equations (5), if we
calculate the velocity of another point of K relative to K, or the
velocity (directed towards the negative x-axis) of a point of K
with respect to K. In short, we can designate v as the relative
velocity of the two systems.
Furthermore, the principle of relativity teaches us that, as
judged from K, the length of a unit measuring-rod which is at
rest with reference to K must be exactly the same as the length,
as judged from K, of a unit measuring-rod which is at rest relative to K. In order to see how the points of the x-axis appear as
viewed from K, we only require to take a “snapshot” of K from
K; this means that we have to insert a particular value of t (time
of K), e.g. t  0. For this value of t we then obtain from the ﬁrst
of the equations (5)
x  ax.
Two points of the x-axis which are separated by the distance
x  1 when measured in the K system are thus separated in
our instantaneous photograph by the distance

x  

(7).

But if the snapshot be taken from K(t  0), and if we eliminate t from the equations (5), taking into account the expression (6), we obtain

�

v2
x  a 1  
x.

From this we conclude that two points of the x-axis separated by the distance 1 (relative to K) will be represented on our

108

But from what has been said, the two snapshots must be
identical; hence x in (7) must be equal to x in (7a), so that
we obtain
1

v2

The equations (6) and (7b) determine the constants a and b.
By inserting the values of these constants in (5), we obtain the
ﬁrst and the fourth of the equations given in Section 11.

(8).

Thus we have obtained the Lorentz transformation for events
on the x-axis. It satisﬁes the condition
x2  c2t2  x2  c2t2

.

.

. (8a).

The extension of this result, to include events which take
place outside the x-axis, is obtained by retaining equations (8)
and supplementing them by the relations
y  y
z  z

�

.

.

.

(9).

In this way we satisfy the postulate of the constancy of the velocity of light in vacuo for rays of light of arbitrary directions,
both for the system K and for the system K. This may be
shown in the following manner.

a p p e n d i x o n e : t h e l o r e n t z t r a n s f o r m at i o n

109

We suppose a light-signal sent out from the origin of K at the
time t  0. It will be propagated according to the equation
2
2
r  �x
�
 y�
 z2 ct,

or, if we square this equation, according to the equation
x2  y2  z2  c2t2  0

.

.

. (10).

It is required by the law of propagation of light, in conjunction with the postulate of relativity, that the transmission of the
signal in question should take place—as judged from K—in
accordance with the corresponding formula
r  ct,
or,
x2  y2  z2  c2t2  0 .

.

.

(10a).

In order that equation (10a) may be a consequence of equation
(10), we must have
x2  y2  z2  c2t2  (x2  y2  z2  c2t2)

(11).

Since equation (8a) must hold for points on the x-axis, we
thus have   1. It is easily seen that the Lorentz transformation
really satisﬁes equation (11) for   1; for (11) is a consequence
of (8a) and (9), and hence also of (8) and (9). We have thus derived the Lorentz transformation.
The Lorentz transformation represented by (8) and (9) still requires to be generalised. Obviously it is immaterial whether the
axes of K be chosen so that they are spatially parallel to those
of K. It is also not essential that the velocity of translation of K
with respect to K should be in the direction of the x-axis. A simple consideration shows that we are able to construct the Lorentz
transformation in this general sense from two kinds of transformations, viz. from Lorentz transformations in the special sense

110

r e l at i v i t y

and from purely spatial transformations, which corresponds to
the replacement of the rectangular co-ordinate system by a new
system with its axes pointing in other directions.
Mathematically, we can characterise the generalised Lorentz
transformation thus:
It expresses x, y, z, t, in terms of linear homogeneous functions of x, y, z, t, of such a kind that the relation
x2  y2  z2  c2t2  x2  y2  z2  c2t2

(11a)

is satisﬁed identically. That is to say: If we substitute their expressions in x, y, z, t in place of x, y, z, t, on the left-hand
side, then the left-hand side of (11a) agrees with the right-hand
side.

a p p e n d i x t wo
Minkowski’s Four-Dimensional
Space (“World”)
[Supplementary to Section 17]

We can characterise the Lorentz transformation still more simply if we introduce the imaginary �1
�. ct in place of t, as
time-variable. If, in accordance with this, we insert
x1  x
x2  y
x3  z
x4  �1
�. ct,
and similarly for the accented system K, then the condition
which is identically satisﬁed by the transformation can be expressed thus:
x12  x22  x32  x42  x12  x22  x32  x42

(12).

That is, by the afore-mentioned choice of “co-ordinates,”
(11a) is transformed into this equation.
We see from (12) that the imaginary time co-ordinate x4 enters into the condition of transformation in exactly the same
way as the space co-ordinates x1, x2, x3. It is due to this fact
that, according to the theory of relativity, the “time” x4 enters
into natural laws in the same form as the space co-ordinates
x1, x2, x3.
A four-dimensional continuum described by the “coordinates” x1, x2, x3, x4, was called “world” by Minkowski,
who also termed a point-event a “world-point.” From a “happening” in three-dimensional space, physics becomes, as it were,
an “existence” in the four-dimensional “world.”

112

r e l at i v i t y

This four-dimensional “world” bears a close similarity to the
three-dimensional “space” of (Euclidean) analytical geometry.
If we introduce into the latter a new Cartesian co-ordinate system (x1, x2, x3) with the same origin, then x1, x2, x3, are linear
homogeneous functions of x1, x2, x3, which identically satisfy
the equation
x12  x22  x32  x12  x22  x32.
The analogy with (12) is a complete one. We can regard
Minkowski’s “world” in a formal manner as a four-dimensional
Euclidean space (with imaginary time co-ordinate); the Lorentz
transformation corresponds to a “rotation” of the co-ordinate
system in the four-dimensional “world.”

appendix three
The Experimental Conﬁrmation
of the General Theory of Relativity

From a systematic theoretical point of view, we may imagine
the process of evolution of an empirical science to be a continuous process of induction. Theories are evolved and are expressed in short compass as statements of a large number of
individual observations in the form of empirical laws, from
which the general laws can be ascertained by comparison. Regarded in this way, the development of a science bears some resemblance to the compilation of a classiﬁed catalogue. It is, as it
were, a purely empirical enterprise.
But this point of view by no means embraces the whole of the
actual process; for it slurs over the important part played by intuition and deductive thought in the development of an exact
science. As soon as a science has emerged from its initial stages,
theoretical advances are no longer achieved merely by a process
of arrangement. Guided by empirical data, the investigator
rather develops a system of thought which, in general, is built
up logically from a small number of fundamental assumptions,
the so-called axioms. We call such a system of thought a theory. The theory ﬁnds the justiﬁcation for its existence in the fact
that it correlates a large number of single observations, and it is
just here that the “truth” of the theory lies.
Corresponding to the same complex of empirical data, there
may be several theories, which differ from one another to a
considerable extent. But as regards the deductions from the theories which are capable of being tested, the agreement between
the theories may be so complete, that it becomes difﬁcult to ﬁnd
any deductions in which the two theories differ from each
other. As an example, a case of general interest is available in

114

r e l at i v i t y

the province of biology, in the Darwinian theory of the development of species by selection in the struggle for existence, and in
the theory of development which is based on the hypothesis
of the hereditary transmission of acquired characters.
We have another instance of far-reaching agreement between the deductions from two theories in Newtonian mechanics on the one hand, and the general theory of relativity on
the other. This agreement goes so far, that up to the present we
have been able to ﬁnd only a few deductions from the general
theory of relativity which are capable of investigation, and
to which the physics of pre-relativity days does not also lead,
and this despite the profound difference in the fundamental assumptions of the two theories. In what follows, we shall again
consider these important deductions, and we shall also discuss
the empirical evidence appertaining to them which has hitherto
been obtained.

(A) MOTION OF THE PERIHELION
OF MERCURY
According to Newtonian mechanics and Newton’s law of gravitation, a planet which is revolving round the sun would describe an ellipse round the latter, or, more correctly, round the
common centre of gravity of the sun and the planet. In such a
system, the sun, or the common centre of gravity, lies in one of
the foci of the orbital ellipse in such a manner that, in the course
of a planet-year, the distance sun-planet grows from a minimum
to a maximum, and then decreases again to a minimum. If instead of Newton’s law we insert a somewhat different law of attraction into the calculation, we ﬁnd that, according to this new
law, the motion would still take place in such a manner that the
distance sun-planet exhibits periodic variations; but in this case
the angle described by the line joining sun and planet during
such a period (from perihelion—closest proximity to the sun—
to perihelion) would differ from 360°. The line of the orbit
would not then be a closed one but in the course of time it

a p p e n d i x t h r e e : t h e e x p e r i m e n ta l c o n f i r m at i o n

115

would ﬁll up an annular part of the orbital plane, viz. between
the circle of least and the circle of greatest distance of the planet
from the sun.
According also to the general theory of relativity, which differs of course from the theory of Newton, a small variation
from the Newton-Kepler motion of a planet in its orbit should
take place, and in such a way, that the angle described by the
radius sun-planet between one perihelion and the next should
exceed that corresponding to one complete revolution by an
amount given by
243a2
 .
T 2c2(1  e2)
(N.B.—One complete revolution corresponds to the angle 2
in the absolute angular measure customary in physics, and the
above expression gives the amount by which the radius sunplanet exceeds this angle during the interval between one perihelion and the next.) In this expression a represents the major
semi-axis of the ellipse, e its eccentricity, c the velocity of light,
and T the period of revolution of the planet. Our result may
also be stated as follows: According to the general theory of
relativity, the major axis of the ellipse rotates round the sun in
the same sense as the orbital motion of the planet. Theory requires that this rotation should amount to 43 seconds of arc per
century for the planet Mercury, but for the other planets of our
solar system its magnitude should be so small that it would necessarily escape detection.1
In point of fact, astronomers have found that the theory of
Newton does not sufﬁce to calculate the observed motion of
Mercury with an exactness corresponding to that of the delicacy of observation attainable at the present time. After taking
account of all the disturbing inﬂuences exerted on Mercury by
the remaining planets, it was found (Leverrier—1859—and
Newcomb—1895) that an unexplained perihelial movement of
the orbit of Mercury remained over, the amount of which does
1

Especially since the next planet Venus has an orbit that is almost an exact circle, which makes it more difﬁcult to locate the perihelion with precision.

116

r e l at i v i t y

not differ sensibly from the above-mentioned 43 seconds of
arc per century. The uncertainty of the empirical result amounts
to a few seconds only.

(B) DEFLECTION OF LIGHT BY
A GRAVITATIONAL FIELD
In Section 12 it has been already mentioned that according to
the general theory of relativity, a ray of light will experience a
curvature of its path when passing through a gravitational ﬁeld,
this curvature being similar to that experienced by the path of a
body which is projected through a gravitational ﬁeld. As a result of this theory, we should expect that a ray of light which is
passing close to a heavenly body would be deviated towards the
latter. For a ray of light which passes the sun at a distance of 
sun-radii from its centre, the angle of deﬂection (a) should
amount to
1.7 seco ds of arc
a  .

It may be added that, according to the theory, half of this deﬂection is produced by the Newtonian ﬁeld of attraction of the
sun, and the other half by the geometrical modiﬁcation (“curvature”) of space caused by the sun.
This result admits of an experimental test by means of the
photographic registration of stars during a total eclipse of the
sun. The only reason why we must wait for a total eclipse is because at every other time the atmosphere is so strongly illuminated by the light from the sun that the stars situated near the
sun’s disc are invisible. The predicted effect can be seen clearly
from the accompanying diagram. If the sun (S) were not present,
a star which is practically inﬁnitely distant would be seen in the
direction D1, as observed from the earth. But as a consequence
of the deﬂection of light from the star by the sun, the star will
be seen in the direction D2, i.e. at a somewhat greater distance
from the centre of the sun that corresponds to its real position.

In practice, the question is tested in the following way. The
stars in the neighbourhood of the sun are photographed during a
solar eclipse. In addition, a second photograph of the same stars
is taken when the sun is situated at another position in the sky,
i.e. a few months earlier or later. As compared with the standard
photograph, the positions of the stars on the eclipse-photograph
ought to appear displaced radially outwards (away from the centre of the sun) by an amount corresponding to the angle a.
We are indebted to the Royal Society and to the Royal Astronomical Society for the investigation of this important deduction. Undaunted by the war and by difﬁculties of both a material
and a psychological nature aroused by the war, these societies
equipped two expeditions—to Sobral (Brazil), and to the island
of Principe (West Africa)—and sent several of Britain’s most
celebrated astronomers (Eddington, Cottingham, Crommelin,
Davidson), in order to obtain photographs of the solar eclipse
of 29th May, 1919. The relative discrepancies to be expected
between the stellar photographs obtained during the eclipse and
the comparison photographs amounted to a few hundredths of
a millimetre only. Thus great accuracy was necessary in making
the adjustments required for the taking of the photographs, and
in their subsequent measurement.

The results of the measurements conﬁrmed the theory in a
thoroughly satisfactory manner. The rectangular components of

(C) DISPLACEMENT OF SPECTRAL LINES
TOWARDS THE RED
In Section 23 it has been shown that in a system K which is in
rotation with regard to a Galileian system K, clocks of identical
construction, and which are considered at rest with respect to
the rotating reference-body, go at rates which are dependent on
the positions of the clocks. We shall now examine this dependence quantitatively. A clock, which is situated at a distance 
from the centre of the disc, has a velocity relative to K which is
given by
v  
where  represents the angular velocity of rotation of the disc

clock per unit time (“rate” of the clock) relative to K when the
clock is at rest, then the “rate” of the clock (	) when it is moving relative to K with a velocity v, but at rest with respect to the
disc, will, in accordance with Section 12, be given by

If we represent the difference of potential of the centrifugal

performed on the unit of mass against the centrifugal force in

In the ﬁrst place, we see from this expression that two clocks of
identical construction will go at different rates when situated at
different distances from the centre of the disc. This result is also
valid from the standpoint of an observer who is rotating with
the disc.
Now, as judged from the disc, the latter is in a gravitational
ﬁeld of potential , hence the result we have obtained will hold
quite generally for gravitational ﬁelds. Furthermore, we can regard an atom which is emitting spectral lines as a clock, so that
the following statement will hold:
An atom absorbs or emits light of a frequency which is dependent on the potential of the gravitational ﬁeld in which it is
situated.
The frequency of an atom situated on the surface of a heavenly

120

body will be somewhat less than the frequency of an atom of
the same element which is situated in free space (or on the
M
surface of a smaller celestial body). Now   K, where K

is Newton’s constant of gravitation, and M is the mass of the
heavenly body. Thus a displacement towards the red ought to
take place for spectral lines produced at the surface of stars as
compared with the spectral lines of the same element produced at
the surface of the earth, the amount of this displacement being

For the sun, the displacement towards the red predicted by theory amounts to about two millionths of the wave-length. A trustworthy calculation is not possible in the case of the stars, because
in general neither the mass M nor the radius  are known.
It is an open question whether or not this effect exists, and
at the present time (1920) astronomers are working with great
zeal towards the solution. Owing to the smallness of the effect
in the case of the sun, it is difﬁcult to form an opinion as to its
existence. Whereas Grebe and Bachem (Bonn), as a result of
their own measurements and those of Evershed and Schwarzschild on the cyanogen bands, have placed the existence of the
effect almost beyond doubt, other investigators, particularly St.
John, have been led to the opposite opinion in consequence of
their measurements.
Mean displacements of lines towards the less refrangible end
of the spectrum are certainly revealed by statistical investigations of the ﬁxed stars; but up to the present the examination
of the available data does not allow of any deﬁnite decision being arrived at, as to whether or not these displacements are to
be referred in reality to the effect of gravitation. The results of
observation have been collected together, and discussed in detail from the standpoint of the question which has been engaging our attention here, in a paper by E. Freundlich entitled “Zur
Prüfung der aligemeinen Relativitäts-Theorie” (Die Naturwissenschaften, 1919, No. 35, p. 520: Julius Springer, Berlin).

a p p e n d i x t h r e e : t h e e x p e r i m e n ta l c o n f i r m at i o n

At all events, a deﬁnite decision will be reached during the
next few years. If the displacement of spectral lines towards the
red by the gravitational potential does not exist, then the general theory of relativity will be untenable. On the other hand, if
the cause of the displacement of spectral lines be deﬁnitely
traced to the gravitational potential, then the study of this displacement will furnish us with important information as to the
mass of the heavenly bodies.
